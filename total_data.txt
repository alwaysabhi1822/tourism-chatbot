January
Post-monsoon cool lingers throughout the country, with downright cold in the mountains. Pleasant weather and several festivals make it a popular time to travel (book ahead!), while Delhi hosts big Republic Day celebrations.
1 Free India
Republic Day commemorates the founding of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950; the biggest celebrations are in Delhi, which holds a huge military parade along Rajpath, and the Beating of the Retreat ceremony three days later.
z Kite Festival
Sankranti, the Hindu festival marking the sun’s passage into Capricorn, is celebrated in many ways across India – from banana-giving to holy dips in the Ganges to cockfights. But it’s the mass kite-flying in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra that steals the show.
z Southern Harvest
The Tamil festival of Pongal, equivalent to Sankranti, marks the end of theharvest season. Families prepare pots of pongal (a mixture of rice, sugar, dhal and milk), symbolic of prosperity and abundance, then feed them to decorated and adorned cows.
1 Celebrating Saraswati
On Vasant Panchami, Hindus dress in yellow and place books, musical instruments and other educational objects in front of idols of Saraswati, the goddess of learning, to receive her blessing. The holiday may fall in February.Street decorations for Southern Harvest (Pongal) festival, Karnataka JOHN ELK III/GETTY IMAGES ©
February
The weather is comfortable in most non-mountainous areas, with summer heat starting to percolate in the south (up to Maharashtra and West Bengal). It’s still peak travel season; sunbathing and skiing are still on.
z Tibetan New Year
Losar is celebrated by Tantric Buddhists all over India – particularly in Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Ladakh and Zanskar – for 15 days. Losar is usually in February or March, though dates can vary between regions.
1 Shivaratri
This day of Hindu fasting recalls the tandava (cosmic victory dance) of Lord Shiva. Temple processions are followed by the chanting of mantras and anointing of linga (phallic images of Shiva). Shivaratri can also fall in March.
z Carnival in Goa
The four-day party kicking off Lent is particularly big in Goa. Sabado Gordo (Fat Saturday) starts it off with elaborate parades, and the revelry continues with street parties, concerts and general merrymaking. Can also fall in March.
LUNAR CALENDAR
Many festivals follow the Indian lunar calendar (a complex system based on astrology) or the Islamic calendar (which falls about 11 days earlier each year), and therefore change annually relative to the Gregorian calendar. Contact local tourist offices for exact festival dates.
MarchMarch
The last month of the travel season, March is full-on hot in most of the country, with rains starting in the Northeast. Wildlife is easier to spot as animals come out to find water.
z Holi
One of North India’s most ecstatic festivals; Hindus celebrate the beginning of spring according to the lunar calendar, in February or March, by throwing coloured water and gulal (powder) at anyone within range. Bonfires the night before symbolise the demise of demoness Holika. (Dates: 23 March 2016, 13 March 2017 and 2 March 2018.)
1 Wildlife-Watching
When the weather warms up, water sources dry out and animals venture into the open to find refreshment: your chance to spot elephants, deer and, if you’re lucky, tigers and leopards. Visit www.sanctuaryasia.com for detailed info.
z Rama’s Birthday
During Ramanavami, which lasts anywhere from one to nine days, Hindus celebrate Rama's birth with processions, music, fasting and feasting, enactments of scenes from the Ramayana and, at some temples, ceremonial weddings of Rama and Sita idols.Holi festival PORAS CHAUDHARY/GETTY IMAGES ©
April
The heat has officially arrived in most places, which means you can get deals and avoid tourist crowds. The Northeast, meanwhile, is wet, but it’s peak time for visiting Sikkim and upland West Bengal.
z Mahavir’s Birthday
In April or March, Mahavir Jayanti commemorates the birth of Jainism’s 24th and most important tirthankar (teacher and enlightened being). Temples are decorated and visited, Mahavir statues are given ritual baths, processions are held and offerings are given to the poor.
z Kumbh Mela
There are several versions of the huge Hindu pilgrimage, Kumbh Mela, heldevery few years, but all involve mass devotion – mass as in tens of millions of people. The next ritual group bathings are in Ujjain (April/May 2016) and Prayag (2019).
May
In most of the country it’s hot. Really hot. Festivals slow down as humidity builds up in anticipation of the rain. Hill stations are hopping, though, and in the mountains it’s pre-monsoon trekking season.
z Buddha’s Birthday
Commemorating the Buddha’s birth, nirvana (enlightenment) and parinirvana (total liberation from the cycle of existence, or passing away), Buddha Jayanti is quiet but moving: devotees dress simply, eat vegetarian food, listen to dharma talks and visit monasteries or temples. Sometimes falls in April. (Dates: 14 May 2016, 3 May 2017 and 22 May 2018.)
2 Northern Trekking
May and June, the months preceding the rains in the northern mountains, are good times for trekking, with sunshine and temperate weather. Consider Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir (but not Ladakh) and Uttarakhand.
June
June’s not a popular travel month in India, unless you’re trekking up north. The rainy season, or pre-monsoon extreme heat, has started just about everywhere else.
z Ramadan (Ramazan)
Thirty days of dawn-to-dusk fasting mark the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. Muslims traditionally turn their attention to God, with a focus on prayer and purification  Ramadan begins around 7 June 2016  27 May 2017 andprayer and purification. Ramadan begins around 7 June 2016, 27 May 2017 and 16 May 2018.
July
It’s really raining almost everywhere, with many remote roads being washed out. Consider visiting Ladakh, where the weather’s surprisingly fine, or do a rainy-season meditation retreat, an ancient Indian tradition.
z Odisha’s Festival of Chariots
During Rath Yatra (Car Festival), effigies of Lord Jagannath (Vishnu incarnated as lord of the world) and his siblings are carried through towns on massive chariots, most famously in Puri, Odisha (Orissa). Millions come to see them. (Dates: 6 July 2016, 25 June 2017 and 14 July 2018.)
z Brothers & Sisters
On Raksha Bandhan (Narial Purnima), girls fix amulets known as rakhis to the wrists of brothers and close male friends to protect them in the coming year. Brothers reciprocate with gifts and promises to take care of their sisters.
z Eid al-Fitr
Muslims celebrate the end of Ramadan with three days of festivities. Prayers, shopping, gift-giving and, for women and girls, mehndi (henna designs) may all be part of the celebrations.
August
It’s still high monsoon season, but it’s prime time in Ladakh. Some travellers love tropical areas, like Kerala or Goa, this time of year: the jungles are lush, green and glistening in the rain.
z Snake FestivalThe Hindu festival Naag Panchami is dedicated to Ananta, the serpent upon whose coils Vishnu rested between universes. Women return to their family homes and fast, while serpents are venerated as totems against flooding and other evils. Falls in July or August (7 August 2016, 27 July 2017 and 15 August 2018).

Janmastami is held August/September. (Dates: 25 August 2016, 15 August 2017 and 2 September 2018.)
z Parsi New Year

1 Nehru Trophy Boat RaceIn Alappuzha (Alleppey); the most popular of Kerala’s boat races.
September
The rain begins to ease up (with temperatures still relatively high), with places such as Rajasthan all but finished with the monsoon. The second trekking season begins midmonth in the Himalaya and runs through October.
z Ganesh Chaturthi
In August or September Hindus celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi, the birth of the elephant-headed god, with verve, particularly in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai. Clay idols of Ganesh are paraded through the streets before being ceremonially immersed in rivers, tanks (reservoirs) or the sea.

October
Some showers aside, this is when India starts to get its travel mojo on. October, aka shoulder season, brings festivals, mostly good weather with reasonably comfy temperatures, and lots of post-rain greenery and lushness.
z Muharram
Shiite Muslims commemorate the martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammed’s grandson Imam Hussain, an event known as Ashura, with fasting, beautiful
i          d          th  f    i   i        d            b          S     i M   li       lprocessions and a month of grieving and remembrance.

www.indiarafting.com.
z Navratri
The Hindu ‘Festival of Nine Nights’ leading up to Dussehra celebrates the goddess Durga in all her incarnations. Festivities, in September or October, are particularly vibrant in West Bengal, Maharashtra and Gujarat; in Kolkata, Durga images are ritually immersed in rivers and tanks.
z Dussehra
Colourful Dussehra celebrates the victory of the Hindu god Rama over the demon-king Ravana and the triumph of good over evil.

z Diwali
In the lunar month of Kartika, in October or November, Hindus celebrate Diwali (Festival of Lights) for five days, giving gifts, lighting fireworks, and burning butter and oil lamps (or hanging lanterns) to lead Lord Rama home from exile.

Booking Trains
In India, riding the rails is a reason to travel all by itself. The Indian rail network goes almost everywhere, almost all the time, and trains have seats to suit every size of wallet. However, booking can be quite an undertaking – book online to take the hassle out of train travel.
Train Classes
Air-Conditioned 1st Class (1AC)
The most expensive class, with two-or four-berth compartments with locking doors and meals included.
Air-Conditioned 2-Tier (2AC)
Two-tier berths arranged in groups of four and two in an open-plan carriage. Bunks convert to seats by day and there are curtains, offering some privacy.
Air-Conditioned 3-Tier (3AC)
Three-tier berths arranged in groups of six in an open-plan carriage with no curtains; popular with Indian families.
AC Executive Chair
Comfortable, reclining chairs and plenty of space; usually on Shatabdi express trains.
AC Chair
Similar to the Executive Chair carriage but with less-fancy seating.
Sleeper Class
Open-plan carriages with three-tier bunks and no AC; the open windows afford great views.
Unreserved/reserved 2nd Class (II/SS or 2S)
Wooden or plastic seats and a lot of people – but cheap!Booking Online
Bookings open 60 days before departure for long-distance trains, sometimes less for short-haul trips. Seats fill up quickly – reserve at least a week ahead where possible, though shorter journeys are usually easier to obtain.
Express and mail trains form the mainstay of Indian rail travel. Not all classes are available on every train, but most long-distance services have general (2nd- class) compartments with unreserved seating and more comfortable reserved compartments, usually with the option of sleeper berths for overnight journeys. Sleeper trains offer the chance to travel huge distances for not much more than the price of a midrange hotel room.
Shatabdi express trains are same-day services with seating only; Rajdhani express trains are long-distance overnight services between Delhi and state capitals with a choice of 1AC, 2AC, 3AC and 2nd class. More expensive sleeper categories provide bedding. In all classes, a padlock and a length of chain are useful for securing your luggage to baggage racks.
These websites are useful for online international bookings.
Cleartrip (www.cleartrip.com) A reliable private agency and the easiest way to book; accepts international MasterCard and Visa credit cards. Can only book direct journeys.

Trekking
India has world-class trekking opportunities, particularly in the Himalaya, where staggering snow-clad peaks, traditional tribal villages, sacred Hindu sites, ancient Buddhist monasteries and blazing fields of wildflowers are just some of the features that create extraordinary mountain experiences. Hit the trails for easy half-day jaunts or strenuous multiweek expeditions.
Best Treks
The Himalaya
Jammu & Kashmir The high, dry and rugged ranges rising in Ladakh boast unforgettable treks, including routes through the popular Markha Valley and wildly beautiful Zanskar region.
Himachal Pradesh Alpine bliss is easily accessible, including on treks from McLeod Ganj to Bharmour, between the Parvati and Pin Valleys, and on the Buddhist-infused Homestay Trail in the Spiti region.
Uttarakhand Immerse yourself in pristine scenery on the Kauri Pass, Milam Glacier and Har-ki-Dun treks or join pilgrims en route to sacred religious sites such as Kedarnath Temple or Hem Kund.
Sikkim Gape at Khangchendzonga (8598m), the world’s third-highest mountain, on the Goecha La trek.
South India
Karnataka Explore the serene hills and forests of Kodagu.
Kerala Check out tigers, elephants and boar in Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary.
Tamil Nadu The hill station Ooty (Udhagamandalam) is popular for forest hikes, but may be closed to trekking due to tiger activity.
Trail TipsWith a commercial trekking industry that's far less developed than in neighbouring Nepal, many places still feel wild and relatively unspoilt. Still, on most routes, you can hire porters or pack animals to haul your gear. If you go with a trekking company, some gear may be supplied. Specify everything that’s included beforehand, and get it in writing if possible.
Wherever you go, make sure you have any permits you may need.
Monitor your health – Acute Mountain Sickness is a serious risk on trails over 3000m.
And beware of herding dogs!
Route Planning
Detailed maps of the Indian Himalaya are difficult to buy in-country. Some maps found online are good enough for planning, and even navigating if you're experienced at reading them. For Ladakh, pricey 1:300,000 scale maps can be bought in Leh; some maps from the 1:200,000 Leomann series are often available in Manali and McLeod Ganj.
On popular pilgrims’ trails, it’s impossible to get lost, but less-travelled tracks can fork or vanish altogether, so hiring a local guide can be wise.
Lonely Planet’s Trekking in the Indian Himalaya is a great resource for planning and executing treks.
For information on climbing Himalayan summits over 6000m, check the website of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation (www.indmount.org).
Packing
A Bring gear and clothing that are appropriate for the conditions you expect to encounter.
A On well-established trails, heavy hiking boots are overkill, but on remote mountain tracks they can be lifesavers.
A First-aid and water-purification supplies are often essential.
A Rain gear is a must, and warm layers are crucial for comfort at altitude. A Remember sunscreen!
Trekking EthicsTrekking Ethics
A Follow low-impact trekking practices (you know the mantra – take only photographs, leave only footprints).
A Cook over stoves, since local people rely on limited fuel-wood sources.
A Respect local cultural sensibilities by dressing modestly; ask permission before snapping photos; remember that while locals' hospitality may be endless, their food supply might not be; and refrain from giving gifts to children.
MOST ADVENTUROUS TREKS
Only an intrepid few hike the tough terrain in the isolated, northeast mountain state of Arunachal Pradesh. One of the top spots to check out is Namdapha National Park, which is bogglingly rich in biodiversity.
When to Go
With India’s diverse variety of terrain and altitudes, there’s no single time throughout the country that’s best for trekking; seasonal conditions vary greatly depending on what region you’re in. Here's an overview of what you can expect, when:
May–June Before the monsoon hits, this is a good time for mountain trekking. Trails to holy Hindu sites can be packed with pilgrims.
Mid-July–mid-September This is monsoon season, so trekking in the wrong place can range from uncomfortable to deadly. Jungle trails can be forbiddingly muddy, while in many parts of the Himalaya cloudbursts cause massive landslides. Meanwhile, peaks are obscured by thick clouds, greatly diminishing the rewards trekkers seek for their efforts. The best places to trek during this time are Ladakh and Spiti, which generally stay pretty dry. The one place worth braving the rain is Uttarakhand’s famous Valley of Flowers National Park, which draws most of its visitors during the rainy season, when its dazzling botanical carpet spreads most vibrantly across the valley floor.
Mid-September–late October Once the monsoons clear out, searing blue skies usually bless the Himalaya. While nights at high altitude may dip below freezing, days are usually sunny and warm. Facilities and services (and some roads) in many mountain regions close for winter in October or November, so if you hope to trek then, check in advance to see what will be open.
December–March The most comfortable season to trek in South India. February is prime time to tackle the frozen Chadar Trek in the Zanskar region of Ladakh.
April Head for the hill stations (at middle altitudes), as it's ripping hot down low and usually stillPlan Your Trip

Volunteering
For all India's beauty, rich culture and history, poverty and hardship are unavoidable facts of life. Many travellers feel motivated to help, and charities and aid organisations across the country welcome committed volunteers. Here's a guide to help you start making a difference.
How to Volunteer
Choosing an Organisation
Consider how your skills will benefit the people you are trying to help, and choose an organisation that can specifically benefit from your abilities.
Time Required
Think realistically about how much time you can devote to a project. You’re more likely to be of help if you commit for at least a month, ideally more.
Money
Giving your time for free is only part of the story; most organisations expect volunteers to cover their accommodation, food and transport.
Working 9 to 5
Make sure you understand what you are signing up for; many organisations expect volunteers to work full time, five days a week.
Transparency
Ensure that the organisation you choose is reputable and transparent about how it spends its money. Where possible, get feedback from former volunteers.
Aid Programs in IndiaIndia faces considerable challenges and there are numerous opportunities for volunteers. It may be possible to find a placement after you arrive, but charities and nongovernment organisations (NGOs) generally prefer volunteers who have applied in advance and been approved for the kind of work involved. Reputable organisations may insist on a criminal background check for working with children. Ethical Volunteering (www.ethicalvolunteering.org) provides useful guidelines for choosing an ethical sending agency.
As well as international organisations, local charities and NGOs often have opportunities, though it can be harder to assess the work that these organisations are doing. For listings of local agencies, check www.ngosindia.com or contact the Delhi-based Concern India Foundation.
The following programs are just some of many that may have opportunities for volunteers; contact them in advance to arrange a placement. Note that Lonely Planet does not endorse any organisations that we do not work with directly, so it is essential that you do your own thorough research before agreeing to volunteer with any organisation.
Caregiving
If you have medical experience, there are numerous opportunities to provide health care and support for the most vulnerable in Indian society.

Travel with Children
Fascinating and thrilling; India can be every bit as exciting for children as it is for their wide-eyed parents. The scents, sights and sounds of India will inspire and challenge young enquiring minds, and with careful preparation and vigilance, a lifetime of vivid memories can be sown.
Best Regions for Kids

Goa
Palm-fringed, white-sand beaches and inexpensive exotic food; an ideal choice for family holidays, whatever the budget.
Uttar Pradesh
The picture-perfect Taj Mahal and the nearby abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri will set young imaginations ablaze.
Kerala
Canoe and houseboat adventures, surf beaches, Arabian Sea sunsets, snake boat races, wildlife-spotting and elephant festivals.
Himachal Pradesh
Pony and yak rides around colonial-era hill stations, rafting, horse riding, tandem paragliding (kids can do it), walks, canyoning and zorbing around Manali.

Why Go?
Mystery, magic, mayhem. Welcome to Delhi, City of Djinns, and 25 million people Like an eastern Rome India’s capital is littered with the relics of lostpeople. Like an eastern Rome, India’s capital is littered with the relics of lost empires. A succession of armies stormed across the Indo-Gangetic plain and imprinted their identity onto the vanquished city, before vanishing into rubble and ruin like the conquerors who preceded them. Modern Delhi is a chaotic tapestry of medieval fortifications, Mughal mausoleums, dusty bazaars, colonial- era town planning, and mega malls.
Travellers sometimes leave Delhi underwhelmed, after ticking off the sights and tussling with the touts. But give the city a chance and you might fall in love. It’s often the lesser-known corners that are most rewarding, such as Lodi Gardens at dusk, the qawwali (Islamic devotional singing) at Nizamuddin or the great fort of Purana Qila. A recommended way to glimpse beneath the surface is to take one of the city’s tours, from a former street child’s view of Old Delhi to a cycle tour along the Yamuna.
Navigating Delhi’s seven cities (or 12, if you include British-built New Delhi and the satellite cities of Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon) is made infinitely easier by its gleaming, cheap and efficient metro.
When to Go
A Oct–Mar Delhi at its best: it’s warm with clear skies, but morning fog can play havoc with flight schedules.
A May–Aug The months to avoid – hot, humid and uncomfortable.A Jun–Sep Monsoon season sees high temperatures and regular rain – a sticky combination.

History Hindus claim Delhi as the site of ancient Indraprastha, home of the Pandavas in the Mahabharata, and excavations near the Purana Qila have revealed evidence of human habitation dating back 3000 years. The name Delhi is linked to the Maurya king Dhilu, who ruled the region in the 1st century BC, but for most of its existence, the city has been known by the names given to it by its conquerors.
The first city for which clear archaeological evidence remains was Lal Kot, or Qila Rai Pithora, founded by the Hindu king Prithvi Raj Chauhan in the 12th century. The city fell to Afghan invaders in 1191, and for the next 600 years, Delhi was ruled by a succession of Muslim sultans and emperors. The first, Qutub-ud-din Aibak, razed the Hindu city and used its stones to construct Mehrauli and the towering Qutb Minar.
Qutub-ud-din Aibak’s Mamluk (Slave) dynasty was quickly replaced by the Khilji dynasty, following a coup. The Khiljis constructed a new capital at Siri, northeast of Mehrauli, supplied with water from the royal tank at Hauz Khas.
ll
h              h         hl        l               d  hFollowing another coup, the Tughlaq sultans seized the reins, creating a new fortified capital at Tughlaqabad, and two more cities – Jahanpanah and Ferozabad – for good measure.
The Tughlaq dynasty fell after Tamerlane stormed through town in 1398, opening the door for the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties, the last of the Delhi sultanates, whose tombs are scattered around the Lodi Gardens. The scene was set for the arrival of the Mughals. Babur, the first Mughal emperor, seized Delhi in 1526, and a new capital rose at Shergarh (the present-day Purana Qila), presided over by his son, Humayun.
Frantic city building continued throughout the Mughal period. Shah Jahan gained the Peacock Throne in 1627 and raised a new city, Shahjahanabad, centred on the Red Fort. The Mughal city fell in 1739, to the Persian Nadir Shah, and the dynasty went into steep decline. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was exiled to Burma (Myanmar) by the British for his role in the 1857 First War of Independence (Indian Uprising); there were some new rulers in town.
When the British shifted their capital to Delhi from increasingly rebellious Calcutta in 1911, it was time for another bout of construction. The architect Edwin Lutyens drew up plans for a new city of wide boulevards and stately administrative buildings to accommodate the colonial government – New Delhi was born.
Delhi has faced numerous challenges since Independence, from the violence of Partition to the deepening gulf between rich and poor, but the city on the Yamuna River continues to flourish, with its new satellite cities adding ever increasing skyscrapers to the city’s outskirts.

Converted into a barracks by the British, this massive fort is a sandstone carcass of its former self, but it still conjures a picture of the splendour of Mughal Delhi. Protected by a dramatic 18m-high wall, the marble and sandstone monuments here were constructed at the peak of the dynasty’s power, when the empire was flush with gold and precious stones. Shah Jahan founded the fortress betweengp
1638 and 1648 to protect his new capital city of Shahjahanabad, but he never took up full residence, after his disloyal son, Aurangzeb, imprisoned him in Agra Fort.
The last Mughal emperor of Delhi, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was flushed from the Red Fort in 1857 and exiled to Burma for his role in the First War of Independence (Indian Uprising). The new conquerors cleared out most of the buildings inside the fortress walls and replaced them with ugly barrack blocks for the colonial army.
Every evening, except Monday, the fort is the setting for a bombastic sound-
and-light show (

The ticket for foreigners covers the museums inside the fort. The audio tour is worthwhile to bring the site to life.Lahore Gate

The main gate to the fort looks towards Lahore in Pakistan, the second most important city in the Mughal empire. During the struggle for Independence, nationalists promised to raise the Indian flag over the gate, an ambition that became a reality on 15 August 1947.
Immediately beyond the gate is the regal Chatta Chowk (Covered Bazaar;

 ), which once sold silk and jewels, but now mainly sells souvenirs.
At the eastern end of the bazaar, the arched Naubat Khana (Drum House;

for royal horses and elephants. Upstairs is the Indian War Memorial

of the Independence struggle. If you walk on through the dilapidated barracks, you’ll reach a deserted baoli (step-well), which the British used as a prison, and
a causeway leading to the Salimgarh (

Those in favour with the emperor, or conquered rivals begging for peace, were admitted to the white marble Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience). This delicate, wedding-cake-like pavilion features some outstanding carving and inlay work. The legendary gold and jewel-studded Peacock Throne was looted from the pavilion by Nadir Shah in 1739.
South of the Diwan-i-Khas is the dainty Khas Mahal (

containing the emperor’s private apartments, shielded from prying eyes by lace- like carved marble screens. An artificial stream, the nahr-i-bihisht (river of paradise), once flowed through the apartments to the adjacent Rang Mahal
(Palace of Colour;

exterior of the palace was once lavishly painted; inside is an elegant lotus-shaped fountain.

A calm respite from the surrounding mayhem, India’s largest mosque can hold a mind-blowing 25,000 people. Towering over Old Delhi, the ‘Friday Mosque’ was Shah Jahan’s final architectural opus, built between 1644 and 1658. It has three gateways, four angle towers and two minarets standing 40m high, and is constructed of alternating vertical strips of red sandstone and white marble. You can enter from gate 1 or 3. The only prayer session where non-Muslims may be present is at 7.45am.
Buy a ticket at the entrance to climb 121 steps up the narrow southern minaret (notices say that unaccompanied women are not permitted, but they may be allowed up with a ‘guide’ who’ll expect a tip). From the top of the minaret, you can see one of the features that architect Edwin Lutyens incorporated into his design of New Delhi – the Jama Masjid, Connaught Place and Sansad Bhavan(Parliament House) are in a direct line.
Visitors should remove their shoes at the top of the stairs. There’s no charge to enter the mosque, but you’ll have to pay the camera charge whether you want to use your camera or not. Once you buy a camera ticket, you should be allowed to go out and re-enter later that day if you choose.

New Delhi’s colonial heart is Connaught Place, named after George V’s paternal uncle, and fashioned after the colonnades of Cheltenham and Bath to assuage British homesickness. Its whitewashed, grey-tinged streets radiate out from the central circle of Rajiv Chowk, lined with shops and restaurants. The outer circle (divided into blocks G to N) is technically called Connaught Circus, and the inner circle (divided into blocks A to F) is Connaught Place, but locals call the whole area ‘CP'.

The most eccentric-seeming of Delhi’s historic sites, Jantar Mantar (derived from the Sanskrit word for ‘instrument’) is an odd collection of curving geometric buildings that are carefully calibrated to monitor the movement of thestars and planets. Maharaja Jai Singh II constructed the observatory in 1725.

HISTORIC BUILDING
(

GOOGLE MAP
 ; Mathura Rd; Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk; mJLN
Stadium)
The most perfectly proportioned and captivating of Delhi’s mausoleums, Humayun’s tomb seems to float above the gardens that surround it. Built in the mid-16th century by Haji Begum, the Persian-born senior wife of the Mughal emperor Humayun, the tomb brings together Persian and Mughal elements, creating a template that strongly influenced the Taj Mahal.
Following six years of restoration, completed in 2013, the tomb, other monuments and gardens are looking bright and beautiful. The arched facade is inlaid with bands of white marble and red sandstone, and the building follows strict rules of Islamic geometry, with an emphasis on the number eight. The surrounding gardens are alive with green parakeets and contain the tombs of the emperor’s favourite barber and Haji Begum. This was where the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, took refuge before being captured and exiled by the British in 1857.
To the right as you enter the complex, Isa Khan’s tomb ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ) is a fine example of Lodi-era architecture, constructed in the
16th century. Further south is the monumental Khan-i-Khanan’s tomb (

 ; Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; hdawn-dusk), plundered in Mughal times to
build Safdarjang’s tomb.
A new visitor centre is due to be added to the site. o Hazrat Nizamud-din Dargah
SHRINE(

GOOGLE MAP
 ; off Lodi Rd; h24hr; mJLN Stadium)
Hidden away in a tangle of bazaars selling rose petals, attars (perfumes) and offerings, the marble shrine of the Muslim Sufi saint Nizamud-din Auliya offers a window through the centuries, full of music and crowded with devotees. The ascetic Nizamud-din died in 1325 at the ripe old age of 92, and his mausoleum became a point of pilgrimage for Muslims from across the empire. Later kings and nobles wanted to be buried as close to Nizamud-din as possible, hence the number of nearby Mughal tombs.
Other tombs in the compound include the graves of Jahanara (daughter of Shah Jahan) and the renowned Urdu poet Amir Khuysru. It’s one of Delhi’s most extraordinary pleasures to take a seat on the marble floor and listen to Sufis singing rousing qawwali at sunset. These are most spectacular on Thursday, but it’s worth visiting on other evenings for a more intimate experience. Scattered around the surrounding alleyways are more tombs and a huge baoli. Entry is free, but visitors may be asked to make a donation.
A tour with the Hope Project, which ends at the shrine, is recommended for some background.

This peaceful park is Delhi’s favourite escape, popular with everyone from power-walking politicians to amorous teens. The gardens are dotted with the crumbling tombs of Sayyid and Lodi rulers, including the impressive 15th-
century Bara Gumbad tomb (

 ) and mosque, and the
strikingly different tombs of Mohammed Shah (

(eight-piered) bridge, which dates from Emperor Akbar’s reign.
Rajpath
(mKhan Market)
AREA
The focal point of Edwin Lutyens’ plan for New Delhi was Rajpath (Kingsway), a grand parade linking India Gate to the offices of the Indian government.Constructed between 1914 and 1931, these grand civic buildings, reminiscent of Imperial Rome, were intended to spell out in stone the might of the British empire – yet just 16 years later, the British were out on their ear and Indian politicians were pacing the corridors of power.
Shielded by a wrought-iron fence at the western end of Rajpath, the official residence of the president of India, Rashtrapati Bhavan, is flanked by the mirror-
image, dome-crowned North Secretariat ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) and South
Secretariat (

GOOGLE MAP
 ), housing government ministries. The Indian
parliament meets nearby at the Sansad Bhavan (Parliament House; 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ), a circular, colonnaded edifice at the end of Sansad Marg.
At Rajpath’s eastern end, and constantly thronged by tourists, is India Gate (
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ). This 42m-high stone memorial arch, designed by Lutyens,
pays tribute to around 90,000 Indian army soldiers who died in WWI, the Northwest Frontier operations, and the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War.

The adjacent house, where the Mahatma spent his last 144 days, contains rooms preserved as Gandhi left them, a detailed account of his last 24 hours, and vivid dioramas depicting scenes from Gandhi’s life, set in boxes like 1950s TVs. Upstairs is the interpretative exhibition Eternal Gandhi.
In the room where Gandhi lodged, you can see his meagre possessions – not much more than a walking stick, spectacles, a spinning wheel and a pair of chappals (sandals).

With its towering walls and dramatic gateways, Purana Qila was constructed by Afghan ruler Sher Shah (1538–45), who briefly seized control of Delhi from the emperor Humayun, and the monumental gatehouse opens onto a peaceful garden studded with ancient monuments. The graceful octagonal, red-sandstone Sher Mandal was used by Humayun as a library; it was a fall down its stairs that ended his reign, and life, in 1556. Beyond is the intricately patterned Qila-i- Kuhran Mosque (Mosque of Sher Shah).
Across busy Mathura Rd are more relics from the city of Shergarh, including
the Khairul Manazil mosque (

DELHI’S MIGHTY MEN
Wander the districts north of Kashmere Gate in Old Delhi and you may notice a disproportionately high number of muscular men. No, it’s not your imagination. This dusty quarter is the favoured stomping ground for Delhi’s traditional mud wrestlers. Kushti, or pehlwani, is a full-contact martial art, fusing elements of yoga and philosophy with combat and intense physical training.
Young men enrol at akharas (training centres) in their early teens, and follow a strict regimen of daily exercise, climbing ropes, lifting weights and hauling logs to build up the necessary muscle bulk for this intensely physical sport. Even diet and lifestyle is strictly controlled; sex, tobacco and alcohol are forbidden, and wrestlers live together in rustic accommodation under the supervision of a coach who doubles as spiritual guide.
Bouts take place on freshly tilled earth, adding an extra element of grit to proceedings.As with other types of wrestling, the aim is to pin your opponent to the ground, but fights often continue until one wrestler submits or collapses from exhaustion. At regional championships, wrestlers compete for golden gadas (ceremonial clubs), a tribute to the favoured weapon of Hanuman, patron deity of wrestling.
Most akharas welcome spectators at the daily dawn and dusk training sessions, so long as this doesn’t interfere with training. Seek permission first to avoid offending these muscle-bound gents – the blog www.kushtiwrestling.blogspot.com is a good introduction to the sport and the main akharas. Indomania Cultural Tours has Yamaya tours that also take in an akhara.

Paharganj & Around
With bumper-to-bumper budget hotels and a deserved reputation for hassle and dodgy characters, Paharganj isn’t everyone’s cup of chai. However, it’s convenient for New Delhi train station, a great place to plug into the traveller grapevine, and the mayhem can grow on you. Note that if you’re paying peanuts, you’re in for a sun-starved, grimy cell. Splash a bit more and you’ll get more cleanliness and comfort. There are also better, more midrange rooms for not much more on nearby Arakashan Rd. Be warned that street noise can be diabolical – keep ear plugs handy.
Because of the pedestrian congestion, taxi-wallahs may be reluctant to take you right to the doorstep of your hotel, but if it’s on the Main Bazaar or Arakashan Rd, they can make it. You can walk to everywhere from New Delhi train station or metro (for Arakashan Rd) or the Ramakrishna Ashram Marg metro stop.
However tired you are when you get off the Airport metro or bus, don’ty                    yg                    p
,
believe rickshaw drivers or anyone who tells you differently. To avoid commission scams when you first arrive, ask rickshaws to drop you at Chhe Tooti Chowk and complete your journey on foot.

But the food is delicious: sample delights such as cheeni ki roti (a hard bread stuffed with jaggery), and bacon-stuffed kulcha (soft-leavened Indian-style bread).

The nightlife scene in Delhi is fairly low-key, but a party mood prevails from Wednesday to Saturday, particularly in the bar-rammed enclave of Hauz Khas. There are also increasing numbers of bars in Paharganj.
A smart-casual dress code (no shorts, vests or flip-flops) applies at many places. Taxes can pack a nasty punch (alcoholic 20%, nonalcoholic 12.5%); they are not included here unless indicated. Most bars have two-for-one happy hours from around noon till 8pm.

7 Shopping Delhi is a fabulous place to shop, from its glittering, frenetic bazaars to its gleaming boutiques and amazing regional craft outlets. Away from government-run emporiums and other fixed-price shops, haggle like you mean it. Many taxi and autorickshaw drivers earn commissions (via your inflated purchase price) by taking travellers to dubious, overpriced places – don’t fall for it.
OLD DELHI’S BAZAARS
Old Delhi’s bazaars are a head-spinning assault on the senses: an aromatic barrage of incense, spices, rickshaw fumes, body odour and worse, with a constant soundtrack of shouts, barks, music and car horns. This is less retail therapy, more heightened reality. The best time to come is midmorning, when you actually move through the streets.Whole districts here are devoted to individual items. Chandni Chowk ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Old Delhi; h10am-7pm Mon-Sat; mChandni Chowk) is all clothing,
electronics and break-as-soon-as-you-buy-them novelties. For silver jewellery, head for
Dariba Kalan ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), the alley near the Sisganj Gurdwara. Off this
lane, the Kinari Bazaar ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), literally ‘trimmings market’, is famous
for zardozi (gold embroidery), temple trim and wedding turbans. Running south from the
old Town Hall, Nai Sarak ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ) is lined with stalls selling saris,
shawls, chiffon and lehanga (long skirts with cords), while nearby Ballimaran ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ) has sequined slippers and fancy, curly-toed jootis (traditional slip-on
shoes).
Beside the Fatehpuri Masjid, on Khari Baoli, is the nose-numbing Spice Market (Gadodia
Market; 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ; Khari Baoli), ablaze with piles of scarlet-red chillis, ginger
and turmeric roots, peppercorns, cumin, coriander seeds, cardamom, dried fruit and nuts. For gorgeous wrapping paper and wedding cards, head to Chawri Bazaar ( 
MAP

 ), leading west from the Jama Masjid. For steel cooking pots and cheap-
as-chapattis paper kites, continue northwest to Lal Kuan Main Bazaar (

8 Information
DANGERS & ANNOYANCES
A Shop & Hotel Touts Taxi-wallahs at the international airport and around tourist areas frequently act as touts for hotels, claiming that your chosen hotel is full, poor value, overbooked, dangerous, burned down or closed, or that there are riots in Delhi, as part of a ruse to steer you to a hotel where they will get a commission. Insist on being taken to where you want to go – making a show of writing down the registration plate number and phoning the autorickshaw/taxi helpline may help. Drivers and men who approach you at Connaught Place run a similar scam for private souvenir emporiums and tourist agents.
A Travel Agent Touts Many travel agencies in Delhi claim to be tourist offices, even branding themselves with official tourist agency logos. There is only one tourist office – at 88 Janpath – and any other ‘tourist office’ is just a travel agency. Should you legitimately need the services of a travel agent, ask for a list of recommended agents from the bona-fide tourist office. Be wary of booking a multistop trip out of Delhi, particularly to Kashmir. Travellers are often hit forextra charges, or find out the class of travel and accommodation is less than they paid for.
A Train Station Touts Touts (often dressed in official-looking uniform) at New Delhi train station endeavour to steer travellers away from the legitimate International Tourist Bureau and into private travel agencies where they earn a commission. An increasing problem is touts telling people that their tickets are invalid or that there’s a problem with the trains, then helpfully assisting them in booking expensive alternative taxis or 3rd-class tickets passed off as something else. As a rule of thumb: don’t believe anyone who approaches you trying to tell you anything at the train station.
INTERNET ACCESS
Most hotels offer free wi-fi access these days. At cafes offering free access, you’ll probably have to show ID.
MEDIA
To check out what’s on, see Little Black Book (www.littleblackbookdelhi.com) or Brown Paper Bag (www.bpbweekend.com/delhi). For printed listings see the weekly calendar pamphlet Delhi Diary (₹30), which is available at local bookshops.

This is the only official tourist information centre outside the airport. Ignore touts who (falsely) claim to be associated with this office. Anyone who ‘helpfully’ approaches you is certainly not going to take you to the real office. It’s a useful source of advice on Delhi, as well as getting out of Delhi and visiting surrounding states.

AIR
Indira Gandhi International Airport (%0124-3376000; www.newdelhiairport.in) is
about 14km southwest of the centre. International and domestic flights use the gleaming new Terminal 3. Ageing Terminal 1 is reserved for low-cost carriers. Free shuttle buses (present your boarding pass and onward ticket) run between the two terminals every 20 minutes, but can take an hour or more. Leave at least three hours between transfers to be safe.
The arrivals hall at Terminal 3 has 24-hour forex, ATMs, prepaid taxi and car- hire counters, tourist information, bookshops, cafes and a Premium Lounge
(%61233922; 3hr s/d ₹2350/3520) with short-stay rooms.
You’ll need to show your boarding pass to enter the terminal. At check-in, be sure to collect tags for all your carry-on bags and ensure these are stamped as you go through security.
Delhi’s airport can be prone to thick fog in December and January (often disrupting airline schedules) – it’s wise to allow a day between connecting flights during this period.

There are three main stations in Delhi: (Old) Delhi train station (aka Delhi Junction) in Old Delhi; New Delhi train station near Paharganj; and Nizamuddin train station, south of Sunder Nagar. Make sure you know which station your train is leaving from.
There are two options for foreign travellers: you can brave the queues at the
main reservation office ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Chelmsford Rd; h8am-8pm, to 2pm Sun), or
visit the helpful International Tourist Bureau (ITB; 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %23405156;
1st fl, New Delhi Train Station; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun).The entrance to the ITB is
before you go onto platform 1, via a staircase just to the right of the entrance to the platform. Do not believe anyone who tells you it has shifted, closed or burnt down! Walk with confidence and ignore all ‘helpful’ or ‘official’ approaches. The ITB is a large room with about 10 or more computer terminals – don’t be fooled by other ‘official’ offices.
When making reservations here, you can pay in cash (rupees) only. Bring your passport.
When you arrive, take a ticket from the machine that gives you a place in the queue. Then complete a reservation form – ask at the information counter to check availability. You can then wait to complete and pay for your booking at the relevant counter. This is the best place to get last-minute bookings for quota seats to popular destinations, but come prepared to queue.
If you prefer to brave the standard reservation office, check the details for your journey (including the train number) in advance on the website of Indian Railways (www.indianrail.gov.in) or Erail (www.erail.in), or in the publication Trains at a Glance (₹45), available at newsstands. You’ll need to fill out a reservation form and queue – after 7pm is the quietest time to book.8 Getting Around
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
International flights often arrive at ghastly hours, so it pays to book a hotel in advance and notify staff of your arrival time. Organised city transport runs
to/from Terminal 3; a free shuttle bus runs every 20 minutes between Terminal 3 and Terminal 1.
A Pre-arranged pick-ups Hotels offer pre-arranged airport pick-up, but you’ll pay extra to cover the airport parking fee (up to ₹140) and ₹80 charge to enter the arrivals hall. To avoid the entry fee, drivers may wait outside Gates 4 to 6. A Metro The Airport Express line (www.delhimetrorail.com) runs every 10 to 15 minutes from 4.45am to 11.30pm, completing the journey from Terminal 3 to New Delhi train station in around 40 minutes (₹60 to ₹80); there are plans to reduce this journey time. It’s usually empty because it’s a separate line from the rest of the metro. You can buy a token for the other lines at the Airport station; check with customer services.
A Bus Air-conditioned buses run from outside Terminal 3 to Kashmere Gate International State Bus Terminal (ISBT) every 20 minutes, via the Red Fort, LNJP Hospital, New Delhi Station Gate 2, Connaught Place, Parliament St and Ashoka Rd (₹75).
A Taxi In front of the arrivals buildings at Terminal 3 and Terminal 1 are Delhi
Traffic Police Prepaid Taxi Counters (%23010101; www.delhitrafficpolice.nic.in)
offering fixed-price taxi services. You’ll pay about ₹350 to New or Old Delhi, and ₹450 to the southern suburbs, plus a 25% surcharge between 11pm and 5am. Travellers have reported difficulty in persuading drivers to go to their intended destination. Insist that the driver takes you to your chosen destination and only surrender your voucher when you arrive.
You can also book a prepaid taxi at the Megacabs counter outside the arrivals building at both the international and domestic terminals. It costs ₹600 to ₹700 to the centre, but you get a cleaner car with air-con.
AUTORICKSHAW & TAXI

tl           tdi          f      thave meters but these are effectively ornamental as most drivers refuse to use them. Delhi Traffic Police runs a network of prepaid autorickshaw booths, where you can pay a fixed fare, including 24-hour stands at the New Delhi, Old Delhi and Nizamuddin train stations; elsewhere, you’ll need to negotiate a fare before you set off.
Fares are invariably elevated for foreigners so haggle hard, and if the fare sounds too outrageous, find another cab. For an autorickshaw ride from Connaught Place, fares should be around ₹40 to Paharganj, ₹60 to the Red Fort, ₹70 to Humayun’s tomb and ₹100 to Hauz Khas. However, it may be a struggle to get these prices. Visit www.taxiautofare.com for suggested fares for these and other journeys. To report overcharging, harassment or other problems, take the license number and call the Auto Complaint Line on 011-42400400/25844444.
Taxis typically charge twice the autorickshaw fare. Note that fares vary as fuel prices go up and down. From 11pm to 5am there’s a 25% surcharge for autorickshaws and taxis. The government has proposed to install microchips to track local taxis to make them safer.
CAR
Numerous operators will rent a car with driver, or you can negotiate directly with taxi drivers at taxi stands around the city. Note that some taxis can only operate inside the city limits, or in certain surrounding states. For a day of local sightseeing, there is normally an eight-hour, 80km limit – anything over this costs extra.

BUS
With the arrival of the metro, travellers rarely use Delhi’s public buses, but the red air-con buses are comfortable and there are several useful routes, including the Airport Express bus (₹75) and bus GL-23, which connects the Kashmere Gate and Anand Vihar bus stations. Fares usually range from ₹15 to ₹25.
CYCLE-RICKSHAW
Cycle-rickshaws are useful for navigating Old Delhi and the suburbs, but are banned from many parts of New Delhi, including Connaught Place. Negotiate a fare before you set off – expect to pay around ₹5 to ₹10 per kilometre.
METRO
Delhi’s magnificent metro (%23417910; www.delhimetrorail.com) is fast and efficient, with signs and arrival/departure announcements in Hindi and English. Trains run from around 6am to 11pm and the first carriage in the direction of travel is reserved for women only. Note that trains can get insanely busy at peak commuting times (around 9am to 10am and 5pm to 6pm) – avoid travelling with luggage during rush hour if at all possible (however, the Airport Express is always empty, as it’s not directly connected to the other lines).
Tokens (₹8 to ₹39) are sold at metro stations. There are also one-/three-day (₹150/300; ₹50 refundable when you return it) ‘tourist cards’ for unlimited short-distance travel, and a Smart Card (₹100; ₹50 refundable), which can be recharged for amounts from ₹200 to ₹1000 – making fares 10% cheaper than paying by token.
Because of security concerns, all bags are X-rayed and passengers must pass through an airport-style scanner.MOTORCYCLE

In a city awash with ancient ruins, the Qutb Minar complex is something special. The first monuments here were erected by the sultans of Mehrauli, and subsequent rulers expanded on their work, hiring the finest craftsmen and artisans to create an exclamation mark in stone to record the triumph of Muslim rule. The Qutb Festival of Indian classical music and dance takes place here every November/December. To reach the complex, take the metro to Qutab Minar station, then take an autorickshaw for the 1km to the ruins.
The complex is studded with ruined tombs and monuments. Ala-ud-din’s sprawling madrasa (Islamic school) and tomb stand in ruins at the rear of the complex, while Altamish is entombed in a magnificent sandstone and marble mausoleum almost completely covered in Islamic calligraphy.
Bags should be left in the cloakroom. For the most atmosphere, try to visit in the morning before the crowds arrive.
Qutb Minar
TOWER
 The Qutb Minar complex is dominated by the spectaclular Qutb Minar, a soaring Afghan-style victory tower and minaret, erected by sultan Qutb-ud-din in 1193 to proclaim his supremacy over the vanquished Hindu rulers of Qila Rai Pithora. Ringed by intricately carved standstone bands bearing verses from the Quran, the tower stands nearly 73m high and tapers from a 15m-diameter base to a mere 2.5m at the top. You can no longer climb the tower for safety reasons, but a webcam allows a view from the top (₹10).
The tower has five distinct storeys with projecting balconies, but Qutb-ud-din only completed the first level before being unfortunately impaled on his saddle while playing polo. His successors completed the job, and kept up the work of restoration and maintenance through the centuries.
Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid
(Might of Islam Mosque)
MOSQUE
At the foot of the Qutb Minar stands the first mosque to be built in India, intended to be a physical symbol of the triumph of Islam. An inscription over the east gate states that it was built with materials obtained from demolishing ‘27 idolatrous temples’. As well as intricate carvings that show a clear fusion of Islamic and pre-Islamic styles, the walls of the mosque are studded with sun disks, shikharas and other recognisable pieces of Hindu and Jain masonry, defaced as far as possible.
Altamish, Qutb-ud-din’s son-in-law, expanded the original mosque with a cloistered court between 1210 and 1220, and Ala-ud-din added the exquisite marble and sandstone Alai Darwaza gatehouse in 1310. Nearby is the dainty tomb of the Turkic saint Imam Zamin, erected in the Lodi era.
Iron Pillar
TOWER
 
Standing in the courtyard of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque is a 7m-high iron pillar that is of such purity that it hasn’t rusted in over 1600 years. This extraordinary pillar vastly predates the surrounding monuments. A six-line Sanskrit inscription indicates that it was initially erected outside a Vishnu temple, possibly in Bihar, in memory of Chandragupta II, who ruled from AD 375 to 413. What the inscription does not tell is how it was made – scientistsp
have never discovered how the iron could be cast using the technology of the time.
Alai Minar
TOWER
 
When the sultan Ala-ud-din made additions to the Qutb Minar complex in the 14th century, he also conceived an ambitious plan to erect a second tower of victory, exactly like the Qutb Minar – but twice as high. Construction got as far as the first level before the sultan died; none of his successors saw fit to bankroll this extravagant piece of showboating. The 27m-high plinth can be seen just north of the Qutb Minar.

 ; hdawn-dusk; mQutab Minar)
Bordering the Qutb Minar complex, but overlooked by most of the tourist hordes, the Mehrauli Archaeological Park preserves some of the most atmospheric relics of the second city of Delhi.
Scattered around a forest park are the ruins of dozens of tombs, palace buildings and colonial-era follies. You can reach the park by turning right from the metro station onto Anuvrat Marg and walking around 500m; the entrance is via a small lane on your left, marked by a board showing the park regulations.
Entering the park from here, the first monuments you’ll see are the time- ravaged tombs of Balban and Quli Khan, his son, which formerly incorporated a mosque. A short walk away is Mehrauli’s most impressive structure, the Jamali Khamali mosque, attached to the tomb of the Sufi poet Jamali. Ask the caretaker to open the doors so you can see the intricate incised plaster ceiling decorated with Jamali’s verses. To the west is the Rajon ki Baoli, a majestic 16th-century step-well with a monumental flight of steps. If you walk from here towards Mehrauli village, on the edge of the street is Adham Khan’s mausoleum, which was once used as a British residence, than later as a police station and post office.
Southwest of the archaeological park is a complex of ruined tombs and summer palaces, constructed in the late Mughal period around the Haus iShamsi tank (

 ; off Mehrauli-Gurgaon Rd). An empty space between
two of the tombs was intended for the last king of Delhi, Bahadur Shah Zafar, who died in exile in Burma (Myanmar) in 1862.

FORT

This mammoth stronghold, the third city of Delhi, was built by sultan Ghiyus- ud-din Tughlaq in the 14th century. For its construction, the king poached workers from the Sufi saint Nizamud-din, who issued a curse that Tughlaqabad would be inhabited only by shepherds. This was indeed the case – today goats are as common as human visitors among the crumbling, vegetation-choked, but still magnificent ruins. To reach the fort, take an autorickshaw from the Tughlaqabad metro station (₹80).
The sultan’s well-preserved sandstone mausoleum, which once stood in the middle of a lake, is separated from his fallen city by a busy highway.Rajasthan

It is said there is more history in Rajasthan than in the rest of India put together. Welcome to the Land of the Kings – a fabled realm of maharajas, majestic forts and lavish palaces. India is littered with splendid ruined bastions, but nowhere will you find fortresses quite as magnificent as those in Rajasthan, rising up imperiously from the desert landscape like fairy-tale mirages from a bygone era.
As enchanting as they are, though, there is more to this most royal of regions than its architectural wonders. This is also a land of sand dunes and jungle, of camel trains and wild tigers, of glittering jewels, vivid colours and vibrant culture. There are enough festivals here to fill a calendar (and an artist’s palette), while the shopping and cuisine are nothing short of spectacular. In truth, Rajasthan just about has it all – it is the must-see state of this must-see country, brimming with startling, thought-provoking and, ultimately, unforgettable attractions.

History
Rajasthan is home to the Rajputs, warrior clans who claim to originate from the sun, moon and fire, and who have controlled this part of India for more than 1000 years. While they forged marriages of convenience and temporary alliances, pride and independence were always paramount; consequently, much of their energy was spent squabbling among themselves. The resultant weakness eventually led to the Rajputs becoming vassals of the Mughal empire.
Nevertheless, the Rajputs’ bravery and sense of honour were unparalleled. Rajput warriors would fight against all odds and, when no hope was left, chivalry demanded jauhar (ritual mass suicide). The men donned saffron robes and rode out to face the enemy (and certain death), while the women and children perished in the flames of a funeral pyre. It’s not surprising that Mughal emperors had such difficulty controlling this part of their empire.
With the Mughal empire declining, the Rajputs gradually clawed back independence – at least until the British arrived. As the British Raj inexorably expanded, most Rajput states allied with the British, which allowed them to continue as independent states, subject to certain political and economic constraints.
These alliances proved to be the beginning of the end for the Rajput rulers. Consumption took over from chivalry so that, by the early 20th century, many of the maharajas spent much of their time travelling the world with scores of retainers, playing polo and occupying entire floors of expensive hotels. While it suited the British to indulge them, the maharajas’ profligacy was economically and socially detrimental. When India gained its independence, Rajasthan had one of the subcontinent’s lowest rates of life expectancy and literacy.
At Independence, India’s ruling Congress Party was forced to make a dealp,
ggy
with the nominally independent Rajput states to secure their agreement to join the new India. The rulers were allowed to keep their titles and their property holdings, and they were paid an annual stipend commensurate with their status. It couldn’t last forever, though, and in the early 1970s Indira Gandhi abolished the titles and the stipends, and severely sequestered rulers’ property rights.
In their absence Rajasthan has made some headway, but the state remains poor. The strength of tradition means that women have a particularly tough time in rural areas. Literacy stood at 67% in 2011 (males 81%, females 53% – a massive rise from 18% in 1961 and 39% in 1991), the third-lowest in India, while the gender gap remains India’s widest.

%0141 Pop 3.07 million Area 65 sq km
Jaipur Rajasthan’s capital is an enthralling historical city and the gateway toJaipur, Rajasthan’s capital, is an enthralling historical city and the gateway to India’s most flamboyant state.
The city’s colourful, chaotic streets ebb and flow with a heady brew of old and new. Careering buses dodge dawdling camels, leisurely cycle-rickshaws frustrate swarms of motorbikes, and everywhere buzzing autorickshaws watch for easy prey. In the midst of this mayhem, the splendours of Jaipur’s majestic past are islands of relative calm, evoking a different pace and another world. At the city’s heart, the City Palace continues to house the former royal family; the Jantar Mantar (the royal observatory) maintains a heavenly aspect; and the honeycomb Hawa Mahal gazes on the bazaar below. And just out of sight, in the arid hill country surrounding the city, is the fairy-tale grandeur of Amber Fort, Jaipur's star attraction.
History
Jaipur is named after its founder, the great warrior-astronomer Jai Singh II (1688–1744), who came to power at age 11 after the death of his father, Maharaja Bishan Singh. Jai Singh could trace his lineage back to the Rajput clan of Kachhwahas, who consolidated their power in the 12th century. Their capital was at Amber (pronounced am-mer), about 11km northeast of present-day Jaipur, where they built the impressive Amber Fort.
The kingdom grew wealthier and wealthier, and this, plus the need to accommodate the burgeoning population and a paucity of water at the old capital at Amber, prompted the maharaja to commence work on a new city in 1727 – Jaipur.
Northern India’s first planned city, it was a collaborative effort combining Jai Singh's vision and the impressive expertise of his chief architect, Vidyadhar Bhattacharya. Jai Singh’s grounding in the sciences is reflected in the precise symmetry of the new city.
In 1876 Maharaja Ram Singh had the entire Old City painted pink (traditionally the colour of hospitality) to welcome the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). Today all residents of the Old City are compelled by law to preserve the pink facade.Jaipur

Old City (Pink City)
The Old City (often referred to as the Pink City) is partially encircled by a crenellated wall punctuated at intervals by grand gateways. The major gates are Chandpol (pol means ‘gate’), Ajmer Gate and Sanganeri Gate.
Avenues divide the Pink City into neat rectangles, each specialising in certain crafts, as ordained in the Shilpa Shastra (ancient Hindu texts). The main bazaars in the Old City include Johari Bazaar, Tripolia Bazaar, Bapu Bazaar and Chandpol Bazaar.

A complex of courtyards, gardens and buildings, the impressive City Palace is right in the centre of the Old City. The outer wall was built by Jai Singh, but within it the palace has been enlarged and adapted over the centuries. There are palace buildings from different eras, some dating from the early 20th century.

The price of admission includes entry to Jaigarh, a long climb above Amber Fort. This is valid for two days.
Mubarak Mahal
Entering through Virendra Pol, you’ll see the Mubarak Mahal (Welcome Palace), built in the late 19th century for Maharaja Madho Singh II as a reception centre for visiting dignitaries. Its multi-arched and colonnaded construction was cooked up in an Islamic, Rajput and European stylistic stew by the architect Sir Swinton Jacob. It now forms part of the Maharaja Sawai
Mansingh II Museum ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), containing a collection of royal
costumes and superb shawls, including Kashmiri pashmina. One remarkable exhibit is Sawai Madho Singh I’s capacious clothing. It’s said he was a cuddly 2m tall, 1.2m wide and 250kg.
Diwan-i-Khas (Sarvatobhadra)
Set between the Armoury and the Diwan-i-Am art gallery is an open courtyard known in Sanskrit as Sarvatobhadra. At its centre is a pink-and-white, marble- paved gallery that was used as the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), where the maharajas would consult their ministers. Here you can see two enormous silver vessels, 1.6m tall and reputedly the largest silver objects in the world; Maharaja Madho Singh II, as a devout Hindu, used these vessels to take holy Ganges water to England for Edward VII’s coronation in 1902.
Diwan-i-Am
Within the lavish Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience) is this art gallery. Exhibits include a copy of the entire Bhagavad Gita (scripture) handwritten in tiny script, and miniature copies of other holy Hindu scriptures, which were small enough to be easily hidden in the event that zealot Mughal armies tried to destroy the sacred texts.
The Armoury
The Anand Mahal Sileg Khana – the Maharani’s Palace – houses the Armoury, which has one of the best collections of weapons in the country. Many of the ceremonial weapons are elegantly engraved and inlaid belying their grislyp                 gyg

purpose.
Pitam Niwas Chowk & Chandra Mahal
Located towards the palace’s inner courtyard is Pitam Niwas Chowk. Here four glorious gates represent the seasons – the Peacock Gate depicts autumn, the Lotus Gate, signifying summer, the Green Gate, representing spring, and finally winter embodied by the Rose Gate.
Beyond this chowk (square) is the private palace, the Chandra Mahal, which is still the residence of the descendants of the royal family and where you can take a 45-minute Royal Grandeur guided tour of select areas.

Adjacent to the City Palace is Jantar Mantar, an observatory begun by Jai Singh in 1728 that resembles a collection of giant bizarre sculptures. Built for measuring the heavens, the name is derived from the Sanskrit yanta mantr, meaning ‘instrument of calculation,’ and in 2010 it was added to India’s list of Unesco World Heritage Sites. Paying for a local guide is highly recommended if you wish to learn how each fascinating instrument works.
Jai Singh liked astronomy even more than he liked war and town planning. Before constructing the observatory he sent scholars abroad to study foreign constructs. He built five observatories in total, and this is the largest and best preserved (it was restored in 1901). Others are in Delhi, Varanasi and Ujjain. No traces of the fifth, the Mathura observatory, remain.

Jaipur’s most distinctive landmark, the Hawa Mahal is an extraordinary, fairy- tale, pink sandstone, delicately honeycombed hive that rises a dizzying five storeys. It was constructed in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh to enable ladies of the royal household to watch the life and processions of the city.

There’s a small museum (Saturday to Thursday), with miniature paintings and some rich relics, such as ceremonial armour, which help evoke the royal past.
Claustrophobics should be aware that the narrow corridors can sometimes get extremely cramped and crowded inside the Hawa Mahal.
Entry is from the back of the complex. To get here, return to the intersection on your left as you face the Hawa Mahal, turn right and then take the first right again through an archway.
2 Walking Tour
Pink CitySTART NEW GATE
FINISH AJMER GATE
LENGTH 4.5KM; THREE TO FIVE HOURS
Entering the old city from 1 New Gate, turn right into 2 Bapu Bazaar, inside the city wall. Brightly coloured bolts of fabric, jootis (traditional shoes) and aromatic perfumes make the street a favourite destination for Jaipur’s women. At the end of Bapu Bazaar you’ll come to 3 Sanganeri Gate. Turn left into 4 Johari Bazaar, the jewellery market, where you will find jewellers, goldsmiths and artisans doing highly glazed meenakari (enamelling).
Continuing north you’ll pass the famous 5 LMB Hotel, and the 6 Jama Masjid, with its tall minarets, and the bustling 7 Badi Chaupar. Be very careful crossing the road here. To the north is 8 Siredeori Bazaar, also known as Hawa Mahal Bazaar. The name is derived from the spectacular 9 Hawa Mahal, a short distance to the north. Turning left on a Tripolia Bazaar, you will see a lane leading to the entrance of Hawa Mahal. A few hundred metres west is the b Tripolia Gate. This is the main entrance to the c Jantar Mantar and d City Palace, but only the maharaja’s family may enter here. The public entrance is via the less ostentatious Atishpol (Stable Gate), a little further along.
After visiting the City Palace complex, head back to Tripolia Bazaar and resume yourwalk west past e Iswari Minar Swarga Sal, which is well worth the climb for the view. Cross the bazaar at the minaret and head west. The next lane on the left is f Maniharon ka Rasta, the best place to buy colourful lac (resin) bangles.
Back on Tripolia Bazaar, continue west to cross Choti Chaupar to Chandpol Bazaar until you reach a traffic light. Turn left into g Khajane Walon ka Rasta, where you’ll find marble and stoneware carvers at work. Continue south until you reach a broad road, h Indra Bazaar, just inside the city wall. Follow the road east towards i Ajmer Gate, which marks the end of this tour.
New City
By the mid-19th century it became obvious that the well-planned city was bursting at the seams. During the reign of Maharaja Ram Singh (1835–80) the seams ruptured and the city burst out beyond its walls. Civic facilities, such as a postal system and piped water, were introduced. This period gave rise to a part of town very different from the bazaars of the Old City, with wide boulevards, landscaped grounds and grand European-influenced buildings.

It was designed by Sir Swinton Jacob, and combines elements of English and North Indian architecture, as well as huge friezes celebrating the world’s great cultures. It was known as the pride of the new Jaipur when it opened in 1887. The grand old building hosts an eclectic array of tribal dress, dioramas, sculptures, miniature paintings, carpets, musical instruments and even an Egyptian mummy.

Piercing the skyline near the City Palace is the unusual Iswari Minar Swarga Sal (Heaven-
Piercing Minaret;

 ; admission ₹20; h9am-4.30pm), just west of
Tripolia Gate. The minaret was erected by Jai Singh’s son Iswari, who later ignominiously killed himself by snakebite (in the Chandra Mahal) rather than face the advancing Maratha army – 21 wives and concubines then did the necessary noble thing and committed jauhar (ritual mass suicide by immolation) on his funeral pyre. You can spiral to the top of the minaret for excellent views over the Old City. The entrance is around the back of the row of shops fronting Chandpol Bazaar – take the alley 50m west of the minaret along Chandpol Bazaar or go via the Atishpol entrance to the City Palace compound, 150m east of the minaret.

The story goes that the fort was named after Nahar Singh, a dead prince whose restless spirit was disrupting construction. Whatever was built in the day crumbled in the night. The prince agreed to leave on condition that the fort was named for him. The views are glorious here and it’s a great sunset spot; there’s a restaurant that’s perfect for a beer.

Near the cenotaphs of the maharanis of Jaipur, and beautifully situated in the watery expanse of Man Sagar, is the beautiful Jal Mahal. It was built in 1799 by Madho Singh as a summer resort for the royal family, which they used to base duck-hunting parties. It’s accessed via a causeway at the rear, and is currently undergoing restoration for tourism under the auspices of the Jal Tarang (www.jaltarang.in) project.

7 Shopping Jaipur is a shopper’s paradise. Commercial buyers come here from all over the world to stock up on the amazing range of jewellery, gems, artefacts and crafts that come from all over Rajasthan. You’ll have to bargainhard – shops have seen too many cash-rich, time-poor tourists, particularly around major tourist centres, such as the City Palace and Hawa Mahal.
Most of the larger shops can pack and send your parcels home for you – although it may be slightly cheaper if you do it yourself.
The city is still loosely divided into traditional artisans’ quarters. Bapu Bazaar is lined with saris and fabrics, and is a good place to buy trinkets. Johari Bazaar and Siredeori Bazaar are where many jewellery shops are concentrated, selling gold, silver and meenakari (highly glazed enamel), a Jaipur speciality. You may also find better deals for fabrics with the cotton merchants of Johari Bazaar.
Kishanpol Bazaar is famous for textiles, particularly bandhani (tie-dye). Nehru Bazaar also sells fabric, as well as jootis, trinkets and perfume. MI Rd is another good place to buy jootis. The best place for bangles is Maniharon ka Rasta, near the Shree Sanjay Sharma Museum.
Plenty of factories and showrooms are strung along the length of Amber Rd, between Zorawar Singh Gate and the Holiday Inn, to catch the tourist traffic. Here you’ll find huge emporiums selling block prints, blue pottery, carpets and antiques; but these shops are used to busloads swinging in to blow their cash, so you’ll need to wear your bargaining hat.
Rickshaw-wallahs, hotels and travel agents will be getting a hefty cut from any shop they steer you towards. Many unwary visitors get talked into buying things for resale at inflated prices, especially gems. Beware of these get-rich- quick scams.

SHOPPING FOR GEMS
Jaipur is famous for precious and semiprecious stones. There are many shops offering bargain prices, but you do need to know your gems. The main gem-dealing area is around the Muslim area of Pahar Ganj, in the southeast of the old city. Here you can see stones being cut and polished in workshops tucked off narrow backstreets.
There is a gem-testing laboratory ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ; %2568221;
www.gtljaipur.info; Rajasthan Chamber Bhawan, MI Rd; h10am-4pm Mon-Sat) in the Rajasthan Chamber Bhawan on MI Rd. Deposit your gems between 10am and 4pm, then return the following day between 4pm and 5pm to pick up an authenticity certificate. The service costs ₹1000 per stone, ₹1600 for same-day service, if deposited before 1pm.
A warning: one of the oldest scams in India is the gem scam, where tourists are fooled into thinking they can buy gems to sell at a profit elsewhere. Don’t be taken in – the gems you buy will be worth only a fraction of what you pay. Often the scams involve showing you real stones and then packing up worthless glass beads to give you in their place. These scams can be elaborate productions and can begin when touts strike up conversations in excellent English while you’re waiting for a bus or eating in a restaurant, until you develop a friendly relationship with them. It might be several hours (or even days if they know where you hang out and can arrange to see you again) before any mention is made of reselling items. Be wary, and never let greed cloud your judgment.

Ordinary buses are known as ‘express’ buses, but there are also ‘deluxe’ buses (coaches really, but still called buses; usually with air-con but not always); these vary a lot but are generally much more expensive and comfortable than ordinary express buses. Deluxe buses leave from Platform 3, tucked away in the right-hand corner of the bus station. Unlike ordinary express buses seats on them can
be booked in advance from the reservation office ( %5116032) here.

 ;
With the exception of those going to Delhi (half-hourly), deluxe buses are much less frequent than ordinary buses.
CAR
Most hotels and the RTDC tourist office can arrange car and driver hire. Depending on the vehicle, costs are ₹8 to ₹12 per kilometre, with a minimum rental rate equivalent to 250km per day. Expect to pay a ₹150 overnight charge, and note, you will have to pay for the driver to return to Jaipur even if you aren’t.
MOTORCYCLE
You can hire, buy or fix a Royal Enfield Bullet (and lesser motorbikes) at
Rajasthan Auto Centre ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %2568074, 9829188064;www.royalenfieldsalim.com; Sanganeri Gate, Sanjay Bazaar; h10am-8pm, to 2pm Sun), the cleanest
little motorcycle workshop in India. To hire a 350cc Bullet costs ₹500 per day (including helmet) within Jaipur.
TRAIN
For same-day travel, buy your ticket at the northern end of the train station on platform 1 at window 10 (closed 6am to 6.30am, 2pm to 2.30pm, and 10pm to 10.30pm). The railway inquiries number is 131.
Station facilities on Platform 1 include an RTDC tourist information bureau, Tourism Assistance Force (police), a cloakroom for left luggage (₹10 per bag per 24 hours), retiring rooms, restaurants and air-conditioned waiting rooms for those with 1st class and 2AC train tickets.
There’s a prepaid autorickshaw stand and local taxis at the road entrance to the train station.
Nine daily trains go to Delhi (sleeper ₹285, 1am, 2.50am, 4.40am, 5am, 6am, 2.35pm, 4.25pm, 5.50pm and 11.15pm), plus more on selected days. The 6am double-decker does the trip in 4½ hours, others take five to six.
Two daily trains leave for Agra (sleeper ₹175, 4½ hours, 6.15am and 3.20pm). Three go to Bikaner (sleeper ₹265, 6½ to 7½ hours, 12.50am, 3.25am and
9.15pm).
Seven go to Jodhpur (sleeper ₹240; five to six hours, 12.45am, 2.45am, 6am, 9.25am, 11.10am, 10.15pm and 11.45pm).
Three go to Udaipur (2nd class ₹165, seven to eight hours, 6.45am, 2pm and
11pm).
Six go to Ahmedabad (sleeper ₹370, 2.30am, 4.25am, 5.35am, 8.45am, 8.35pm and 12.25am). The 12.25am is the quickest (nine hours), while the others take 11 to 13 hours.
For Pushkar, 11 daily trains make the trip to Ajmer (2nd class ₹90, two hours), plus many more on selected days so you rarely wait more than an hour.
For Ranthambhore, six daily trains go to Sawai Madhopur (2nd class ₹90, two to three hours, 5.40am, 11.05am, 2pm, 4.50pm, 5.35pm and 11.55pm), plus plenty more on selected days.
Two trains make the daily run to Jaisalmer (sleeper ₹360, 12 hours, 11.10amand 11.45pm).
8 Getting Around
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
There are no bus services from the airport, which is 12km southeast of the city. An autorickshaw costs at least ₹250; a taxi upwards of ₹450. There’s a prepaid taxi booth inside the terminal.
AUTORICKSHAW
Autorickshaw drivers at the bus and train stations might just be the pushiest in Rajasthan. Use the fixed-rate prepaid autorickshaw stands instead. Keep hold of your docket to give to the driver at the end of the journey. In other cases beprepared to bargain hard – expect to pay at least ₹80 from either station to the Old City.
CYCLE-RICKSHAW
You can do your bit for the environment by flagging down a lean-limbed cycle- rickshaw rider. Though it can be uncomfortable watching someone pedalling hard to transport you, this is how they make a living. A short trip costs about
₹40.
TAXI
There are unmetered taxis available, which will require negotiating a fare, or you
can try Mericar (%4188888; www.mericar.in; flagfall incl 2km ₹50, afterwards per km ₹13, 25%
night surcharge 10pm-5am; h24hr). It’s a 24-hour service and taxis can be hired for sightseeing for four-/six-/eight-hour blocks costing ₹600/1000/1500.
Around Jaipur
Amber
The formidable, magnificent, honey-hued fort of Amber (pronounced am-mer), an ethereal example of Rajput architecture, rises from a rocky mountainside about 11km northeast of Jaipur, and is the city’s must-see sight.
Amber, the former capital of Jaipur state, was built by the Kachhwaha Rajputs who hailed from Gwalior, in present day Madhya Pradesh, where they reigned for over 800 years. Construction of the fort, which was begun in 1592 by Maharaja Man Singh, the Rajput commander of Akbar’s army, was financed with war booty. It was later extended and completed by the Jai Singhs before they moved to Jaipur on the plains below.
1 Sights
Amber Fort
(Indian/foreigner ₹25/200, guide ₹200, audio guide Hindi/other ₹100/150; h8am-6pm, last entry
FORT5.30pm)
This magnificent fort is largely made up of a royal palace, built from pale yellow and pink sandstone and white marble, and divided into four main sections, each with its own courtyard. You can trudge up to the fort from the road in about 10
minutes, but riding up on elephant back (one-way per 2 passengers ₹900; h7.30am-
noon & 3.30-5.30pm) is very popular. A return 4WD to the top and back costs ₹300 for five passengers, including one-hour waiting time.
Animal welfare groups have criticised the keeping of elephants at Amber, as recent government inspections have revealed inadequate housing conditions and abuse of the animals, so you may want to think twice before taking a ride.
Whether you walk or ride an elephant, you will enter Amber Fort through Suraj Pol (Sun Gate), which leads to the Jaleb Chowk (Main Courtyard), where returning armies would display their war booty to the populace – women could view this area from the veiled windows of the palace. The ticket office is directly across the courtyard from Suraj Pol. If you arrive by car, you will enter through Chand Pol (Moon Gate) on the opposite side of Jaleb Chowk. Hiring a guide or grabbing an audio guide is highly recommended as there are very few signs and many blind alleys.
From Jaleb Chowk, an imposing stairway leads up to the main palace, but first it’s worth taking the steps just to the right, which lead to the small Siladevi Temple, with its gorgeous silver doors featuring repoussé (raised relief) work.
Heading back to the main stairway will take you up to the second courtyard and the Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), which has a double row of columns, each topped by a capital in the shape of an elephant, and latticed galleries above.
The maharaja’s apartments are located around the third courtyard – you enter through the fabulous Ganesh Pol, decorated with beautiful frescoed arches. The Jai Mandir (Hall of Victory) is noted for its inlaid panels and multimirrored ceiling. Carved marble relief panels around the hall are fascinatingly delicate and quirky, depicting cartoonlike insects and sinuous flowers. Opposite the Jai Mandir is the Sukh Niwas (Hall of Pleasure), with an ivory-inlaid sandalwood door and a channel that once carried cooling water right through the room. From the Jai Mandir you can enjoy fine views from the palace ramparts overpicturesque Maota Lake below.
The zenana (secluded women’s quarters) surrounds the fourth courtyard. The rooms were designed so that the maharaja could embark on his nocturnal visits to his wives’ and concubines’ respective chambers without the others knowing, as the chambers are independent but open onto a common corridor.
Jaigarh
FORT
(Indian/foreigner ₹35/85, camera/video ₹50/200, car ₹50, Hindi/English guide ₹100/150; h9am-5pm)
A scrubby green hill rises above Amber and is topped by the imposing Jaigarh, built in 1726 by Jai Singh. The stern fort, punctuated by whimsical-hatted lookout towers, was never captured and has survived intact through the centuries. It’s an uphill walk (about 1km) from Amber and offers great views from the Diwa Burj watchtower. The fort has reservoirs, residential areas, a puppet theatre and the world’s largest wheeled cannon, Jaya Vana.
Anokhi Museum of Hand Printing
MUSEUM
(Anokhi Haveli, Kheri Gate; child/adult ₹15/30, camera/video ₹50/150; h10.30am-4.30pm Tue-Sat, 11am- 4.30pm Sun, closed 1 May-15 Jul)
This interesting museum in a restored haveli documents the art of handblock printing, from old traditions to contemporary design. You can watch masters carve unbelievably intricate wooden printing blocks and even have a go at printing your own scarf or T-shirt. There’s a cafe and gift shop too. From the museum you can walk around the ancient town to the restored Panna Meena Baori (step-well) and Jagat Siromani Temple (known locally as the Meera Temple).
4 Sleeping The decidedly untouristy village of Amber, with its colourful food market and scattering of temples and palace ruins, makes a low-key alternative to hectic Jaipur as a possible place to stay.
o Mosaics Guesthouse
GUESTHOUSE(%8875430000, 2530031; www.mosaicsguesthouse.com; Siyaram Ki Doongri, Amber; s/d incl breakfast ₹3200/3500; aiW)
Get away from it all at this gorgeous arty place (the French owner is a mosaic artist and will show off his workshop) with four lovely rooms and a rooftop terrace with beautiful fort views. Set-price Franco-Indian meals cost ₹500. It’s about 1km past the fort near Kunda Village; head for Siyaram Ki Doongri, where you’ll find signs.
8 Getting There & Away There are frequent buses to Amber from near the Hawa Mahal in Jaipur (non-AC/AC ₹14/25, 15 minutes). They drop you opposite where you start your climb up to the entrance of Amber Fort.
The elephant rides and 4WDs start 100m further down the hill from the bus drop-off .
An autorickshaw/taxi will cost at least ₹400/700 for the return trip from Jaipur. RTDC city tours include Amber Fort.
Sanganer
The village of Sanganer is 12km south of Jaipur and has a ruined palace, a group of Jain temples with fine carvings (to which entry is restricted) and two ruined tripolias (triple gateways). The main reason to visit, however, is to see its handmade paper-and blockprinting shops, workshops and factories (mostly found around the main drag, Stadium Rd), where you can see the products being made. You can also walk down towards the riverbank to see the enormous, brightly coloured fabrics drying in the sun as they hang on huge racks.
Salim’s Paper (%2730222; www.handmadepaper.com; Gramodyog Rd, Sanganer; h9am-
5pm) is the largest handmade paper factory in India, and offers tours. The paper is made from fabric scraps, and often decorated with petals or leaves. The 200 or so employees produce 40,000 sheets a day, which are exported all over the world. There’s also a beautiful range of paper products for sale in the showroom.
For blockprinted fabrics and blue pottery, there are a number of shops,
including Sakshi (%2731862; Laxmi Colony; hshop 8.30am-8.30pm, factory 9am-6pm). Youcan see the blockprinting workshop here, and even try your hand at block printing; it runs courses in block printing and blue pottery. There’s a tremendous range of blue pottery and blockprinted fabrics for sale.
8 Getting There & Away Local buses leave from the Ajmeri Gate in Jaipur for Sanganer every few minutes (₹12, one hour).

Bharatpur & Keoladeo Ghana National Park

Bharatpur is famous for its wonderful Unesco–listed Keoladeo Ghana National Park, a wetland and significant bird sanctuary. Apart from the park, Bharatpur has a few historical vestiges, though it wouldn't be worth making the journey for these alone. The town is dusty, noisy and not particularly visitor friendly. Bharatpur hosts the boisterous and colourful Brij Festival just prior to Holi celebrations.
The entrance to Keoladeo Ghana National Park lies 2km to the south of Bharatpur’s centre.Bharatpur

Lohagarh
FORT
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
The still-inhabited, 18th-century Lohagarh, Iron Fort, was so named because of its sturdy defences. Despite being somewhat forlorn and derelict it is still impressive, and sits at the centre of town, surrounded by a moat. There’s a north entrance, at Austdhatu (Eight-Metal) Gate – apparently the spikes on the gate are made of eight different metals – and a southern entrance, at Lohiya Gate.
Maharaja Suraj Mahl, constructor of the fort and founder of Bharatpur, built two towers, the Jawahar Burj and the Fateh Burj, within the ramparts to commemorate his victories over the Mughals and the British. The fort also contains three much decayed palaces within its precincts.
One of the palaces, centred on a tranquil courtyard, houses a seemingly
forgotten museum ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹10/50, camera/video ₹10/20,
photography prohibited inside museum; h10am-4.30pm Tue-Sun). Upstairs is a rather ragtag
display of royal artefacts, including weaponry. More impressive is the Jain sculpture gallery, which includes some beautiful 7th-to 10th-century pieces. The most spectacular feature of the museum, however, is the palace’s original hammam (bathhouse), which retains some fine carvings and frescoes.
Keoladeo Ghana National Park
This tremendous bird sanctuary and national park (Indian/foreigner ₹55/400, video
₹400, guide ₹150, bike/mountain-bike rental ₹25/50, binoculars rental ₹100; h6am-6pm Apr-Sep,
6.30am-5pm Oct-Mar) has long been recognised as one of the world’s most important bird breeding and feeding grounds. In a good monsoon season, over one-third of the park can be submerged, hosting over 360 species within its 29 sq km. The marshland patchwork is a wintering area for aquatic birds, including visitors from Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, China and Siberia. The park is also home to deer, nilgai and boar, which can be readily spotted.
Keoladeo originated as a royal hunting reserve in the 1850s. It continued to supply the maharajas’ tables with fresh game until as late as 1965. In 1982Keoladeo was declared a national park and it was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1985.
Local campaigners have voiced concern in recent years at the increase in forest clearing to make way for small, tourism-related developments, such as the car park to your right as you enter the park. You’ll notice that much of the park is no longer tree-shaded. They are also calling for a 2km ‘no-construction zone’ outside the park boundary. The current limit is 500m.
Visiting the Park
The best time to visit is from October to February, when you'll see many migratory birds.
Admission (₹400; sunrise to sunset) entitles you to one entrance per day. Guides cost ₹150 per hour. One narrow road (no motorised vehicles are permitted past checkpoint 2) runs through the park, but a number of tracks and pathways fan out from it and thread their way between the shallow wetlands. Generally speaking, the further away from the main gate you go, the more interesting the scenery, and the more varied the wildlife becomes.
Only the government-authorised cycle-rickshaws (recognisable by the yellow license plate) are allowed beyond checkpoint 2. You don’t pay an admission fee for the drivers, but they charge ₹70 per hour. Some are very knowledgable. However, these cycle-rickshaws can only travel along the park’s larger tracks.
An excellent way to see the park is by hiring a bicycle at the park entrance. Having a bike is a wonderfully quiet way to travel, and allows you to avoid bottlenecks and take in the serenity on your own. However, we recommend that lone female travellers who wish to cycle do so with a guide (who will cycle alongside you), as we've had more than one report of lone women being harassed by young men inside the park in recent years.
You get a small map with your entrance ticket, although the park isn’t big so it’s difficult to get lost.
4 Sleeping & Eating There are tons of sleeping options near the Keoladeo Ghana National Park (suiting allbudgets), either on the stretch of the highway beside Birder’s Inn or on the dirt track that the Falcon Guest House is on.
Almost all guesthouses have restaurants, which are open to nonguests too, and even those without a proper bar can sort you out with a cold beer if you ask.

Alwar
%0144 / Pop 266,200
Alwar is perhaps the oldest of the Rajasthani kingdoms, forming part of the Matsya territories of Viratnagar in 1500 BC. It became known again in the 18th century under Pratap Singh, who pushed back the rulers of Jaipur to the south and the Jats of Bharatpur to the east, and who successfully resisted the Marathas. It was one of the first Rajput states to ally itself with the fledgling British empire, although British interference in Alwar’s internal affairs meant that this partnership was not always amicable.
Alwar is the nearest town to Sariska Tiger Reserve, and has a ruined fort and a rambling palace with an above-average museum hidden inside it. The town has relatively few tourists so there’s a refreshing lack of hassle here.
1 Sights
Bala Qila
FORT( 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
This imposing fort stands 300m above Alwar, its fortifications hugging the steep hills that line the eastern edge of the city. Predating the time of Pratap Singh, it’s one of the few forts in Rajasthan built before the rise of the Mughals, who used it as a base for attacking Ranthambhore. Mughal emperors Babur and Akbar have stayed overnight here, and Prince Salim (later Emperor Jehangir) was exiled in Salim Mahal for three years.
Now in ruins, the fort houses a radio transmitter station and parts can only be visited with permission from the superintendent of police. However, this is easy to get: just ask at the superintendent’s office in the City Palace complex. You can walk the very steep couple of kilometres up to the fort entrance or take a
7km rickshaw ride.
City Palace

HISTORIC BUILDING

Below Bala Qila sprawls the colourful and convoluted City Palace complex, with massive gates and a tank reflecting a symmetrical series of ghats and pavilions. Today most of the complex is occupied by government offices, overflowing with piles of dusty papers and soiled by pigeons and splatters of paan (a mixture of betel nut and leaves for chewing).
Hidden within the City Palace is the excellent Alwar Museum (
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹5/50; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun).
Alwar Museum’s eclectic exhibits evoke the extravagance of the maharajas’ lifestyle: stunning weapons, stuffed Scottish pheasants, royal ivory slippers, erotic miniatures, royal vestments, a solid silver table, and stone sculptures, such as an 11th-century sculpture of Vishnu.
Somewhat difficult to find in the Kafkaesque tangle of government offices, the museum is on the top floor of the palace, up a ramp from the main courtyard. However, there are plenty of people around to point you in the right direction and from there you can follow the signs.
Cenotaph of Maharaja Bakhtawar Singh
HISTORIC BUILDING
(

 )This double-storey edifice, resting on a platform of sandstone, was built in 1815 by Maharaja Vinay Singh, in memory of his father. To gain access to the cenotaph, take the steps to the far left when facing the palace. The cenotaph is also known as the Chhatri of Moosi Rani, after one of the mistresses of Bakhtawar Singh who performed sati (self-immolation) on his funeral pyre – after this act she was promoted to wifely status.
4 Sleeping & Eating As not many tourists stop here, Alwar’s hotels are mostly aimed at budget business travellers and aren't particularly great value.

You have to pay 10% extra to eat in the air-conditioned section – but it is worth it. Turn right out of the bus station, take the first left (towards Hope Circle) and it’s on your left after 100m.

They come in the form of white minivans and have the word ‘Vahini’ printed on their side doors. One handy route goes past Hotel Aravali, the tourist office and the train station before continuing on to the bus station and terminating a short walk from Vinay Vilas Mahal (the palace complex).
A return taxi to Sariska Tiger Reserve will cost you around ₹1200.

TRAIN
There are around a dozen daily trains to Delhi (3AC/sleeper ₹170/585, three to four hours), leaving throughout the day. Most services go to Old Delhi.
There are 16 daily trains to Jaipur (three to four hours). Prices are almost identical to those for Delhi.
Sariska Tiger Reserve
%0144
Enclosed within the dramatic, shadowy folds of the Aravallis, the Sariska
Tiger Reserve (Indian/foreigner ₹60/450, vehicle ₹250; hticket sales 7am-3.30pm Oct-Mar, 6.30am-4pm Apr-Sep, park closes at sunset) is a tangle of remnant semi-deciduous jungle
and craggy canyons sheltering streams and lush greenery. It covers 866 sq km (including a core area of 498 sq km), and is home to peacocks, monkeys, majestic sambars, nilgai, chital, wild boars and jackals.Although Project Tiger has been in charge of the sanctuary since 1979, there has been a dramatic failure in tiger protection. In 2004 there were an estimated 18 tigers in Sariska; however, this was called into question after an investigation by the WWF. That report prompted the federal government to investigate what has happened to the tigers of this reserve.
Sariska is in any case a fascinating sanctuary. Unlike most national parks, it opens year-round, although the best time to spot wildlife is from November to March, and you’ll see most wildlife in the evening. During July and August your chances of spotting wildlife are minimal, as the animals move to higher ground, and the park is open primarily for temple pilgrimage rather than wildlife viewing.
Proposals to stop private-car access and to end the free access to pilgrims visiting the Hanuman temple often get press coverage, but to date there has been no further action taken.
SARISKA’S TIGER TALE
Sariska Tiger Reserve took centre stage in one of India’s most publicised wildlife dramas. In 2005 an Indian journalist broke the news that the tiger population here had been eliminated, a report that was later confirmed officially after an emergency census was carried out.
An inquiry into the crisis recommended fundamental management changes before tigers be reintroduced to the reserve. Extra funding was proposed to cover the relocation of villages within the park as well as increasing the protection force. But action on the recommendations has been slow and incomplete despite extensive media coverage and a high level of concern in India.
Nevertheless, a pair of tigers from Ranthambhore National Park were moved by helicopter to Sariska in 2008. By 2010, five tigers had been transferred. However, in November 2010 the male of the original pair was found dead, having been poisoned by local villagers, who are not supportive of the reintroduction. The underlying problem – the inevitable battle between India’s poorest and ever-expanding village populace with the rare and phenomenally valuable wildlife on their doorstep. Plans to relocate and reimburse villagers inside the park have largely failed to come to fruition, and illegal marble mining and clashes between cattle farmers and park staff have remained a problem.
In early 2012 the first cubs were sighted. In recent years Sariska's tiger population was thought to be 13 – made up of seven females, two males and four cubs all born in the park.
Only time will tell if this reintroduction is successful    inbreeding in the smallOnly time will tell if this reintroduction is successful – inbreeding in the small population is an understandably high concern. As things stand, Sariska remains a sad indictment of tiger conservation in India, from the top government officials down to the underpaid forest guards.
1 Sights
Besides wildlife, Sariska has some fantastic sights within the reserve and around its peripheries, which are well worth seeking out. If you take a longer tour, you can ask to visit one or more of these. A couple of them are also accessible by public bus.
Kankwari Fort
FORT
 
Deep inside the sanctuary, this imposing small jungle fort, 22km from Sariska, offers amazing views over the plains of the national park, dotted with red mud- brick villages. This is the inaccessible place that Aurangzeb chose to imprison his brother, Dara Shikoh, Shah Jahan’s chosen heir to the Mughal throne, for several years before he was beheaded.
A four-to five-hour 4WD safari (one to five passengers plus guide) to Kankwari Fort from the Forest Reception Office near the reserve entrance costs ₹1600, plus guide fee (₹150).
Bhangarh
HISTORIC SITE
 
Around 55km from Sariska, beyond the inner park sanctuary and out in open countryside, is this deserted, well-preserved and notoriously haunted city. Founded in 1631 by Madho Singh, it had 10,000 dwellings, but was suddenly deserted about 300 years ago for reasons that remain mysterious. Bhangarh can be reached by a bus that runs twice daily through the sanctuary (₹35) to nearby Golaka village. Check what time the bus returns, otherwise you risk getting stranded.T Tours
Private cars, including taxis, are limited to sealed roads. The best way to visit the park is by 4WD gypsy (open-topped, six-passenger 4WDs), which can explore off the main tracks. Gypsy safaris start at the park entrance and you’ll be quoted ₹1050 for three hours, or ₹3200 for a full day. Guides are available (₹150 for three hours).
Bookings can be made at the Forest Reception Office (%2841333; Jaipur Rd), directly opposite the Hotel Sariska Palace, which is where buses will drop you off.

Ajmer
%0145 / Pop 490,500
Ajmer is a bustling, chaotic city, 13km from the traveller haven of Pushkar. It surrounds the tranquil lake of Ana Sagar, and is itself ringed by the rugged Aravalli hills. Ajmer is Rajasthan’s most important site in terms of Islamic history and heritage. It contains one of India’s most important Muslim pilgrimage centres – the shrine of Khwaja Muin-ud-din Chishti, who founded India’s most important Sufi order. As well as some superb examples of early Muslim architecture, Ajmer is also a significant centre for the Jain religion, possessing an amazing golden Jain temple. However, with Ajmer’s combination of high-voltage crowds and traffic, most travellers choose to stay in laid-back Pushkar, and visit on a day trip.Ajmer

ISLAMIC SHRINE
(

 ; www.dargahajmer.com; h4am-9pm summer, 5am-9pm winter)
This is the tomb of Sufi saint Khwaja Muin-ud-din Chishti, who came to Ajmer from Persia in 1192 and died here in 1236. The tomb gained its significance during the time of the Mughals – many emperors added to the buildings here. Construction of the shrine was completed by Humayun, and the gate was added by the Nizam of Hyderabad. Mughal emperor Akbar used to make the pilgrimage to the dargah from Agra every year.
You have to cover your head in certain parts of the shrine, so remember to take a scarf or cap – there are plenty for sale at the colourful bazaar leading to the dargah, along with floral offerings and delicious toffees.
The main entrance is through Nizam Gate (1915). Inside, the green and white mosque, Akbari Masjid, was constructed in 1571 and is now an Arabic and Persian school for religious education. The next gate is called the Nakkarkhana because it has two large nakkharas (drums) fixed above it.
A third gate, Buland Darwaza (16th century), leads into the dargah courtyard. Flanking the entrance of the courtyard are the degs (large iron cauldrons), one donated by Akbar in 1567, the other by Jehangir in 1631, for offerings for the poor.
Inside this courtyard, the saint’s domed tomb is surrounded by a silver platform. Pilgrims believe that the saint’s spirit will intercede on their behalf in matters of illness, business or personal problems, so the notes and holy string attached to the railings around are thanks or requests.Pilgrims and Sufis come from all over the world on the anniversary of the saint’s death, the Urs, in the seventh month of the lunar calendar, Jyaistha. Crowds can be suffocating.
Bags must be left in the cloakroom (₹10 each, with camera ₹20) outside the main entrance.

Beyond the Dargah of Khwaja Muin-ud-din Chishti, on the town outskirts, are the extraordinary ruins of the Adhai-din-ka-Jhonpra mosque. According to legend, construction in 1153 took only two-and-a-half days. Others say it was named after a festival lasting two-and-a-half days. It was originally built as a Sanskrit college, but in 1198 Mohammed of Ghori seized Ajmer and converted the building into a mosque by adding a seven-arched wall covered with Islamic calligraphy in front of the pillared hall.

%0145 / Pop 14,800
Pushkar has a magnetism all of its own, and is quite unlike anywhere else in Rajasthan. It’s a prominent Hindu pilgrimage town and devout Hindus should visit at least once in their lifetime. The town curls around a holy lake, said to have appeared when Brahma dropped a lotus flower. It also has one of the
world’s few Brahma temples ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ). With 52 bathing ghats
and 400 milky-blue temples, the town often hums with pujas (prayers) generating an episodic soundtrack of chanting, drums and gongs, and devotional songs.
The result is a muddle of religious and tourist scenes. The main street is one long bazaar, selling everything to tickle a traveller’s fancy, from hippy-chic tie- dye to didgeridoos. Despite the commercialism and banana pancakes, the town remains enchantingly small and authentically mystic.
Pushkar is only 11km from Ajmer but is separated from it by Nag Pahar, the Snake Mountain.Pushkar

HINDU TEMPLE
 
About 8km southwest of the town (past the turn-off to Saraswati Temple) is acollection of Shiva temples near Ajaypal, which make a great trip by motorbike (or bike if you’re fit and start early in the day), through barren hills and quiet villages. Be warned: the track is hilly and rocky.
Another Shiva temple is about 8km north of Pushkar, tucked down inside a cave, which would make for a good excursion.
Ghats
Fifty-two bathing ghats surround the lake, where pilgrims bathe in the sacred waters. If you wish to join them, do so with respect. Remember, this is a holy place: remove your shoes and don’t smoke, kid around or take photographs.

T Tours Plenty of people in Pushkar offer short camel rides (around ₹200 per hour), which are a good way to explore the starkly beautiful landscape – a mixture of desert and rocky hills – around town. Sunset rides are the most popular. It’s best to ask for recommendations at your hotel.
For longer camel treks, prices start at around ₹500 per person per day for a group of four. You can head out to Jodhpur (five to six days) or even Jaisalmer (10 to 12 days). Numerous operators line Ajmer Rd, but note, these places are less professional than the operators in Jaisalmer and Bikaner.
4 Sleeping Owing to Pushkar’s star status among backpackers, there are far more budget than midrange options, though many hotels have a selection of midrange-priced rooms. At the time of the camel fair, prices multiply up to threefold or more, and it’s essential to book several weeks ahead.

DANGERS & ANNOYANCES
Beware of anyone peddling flowers to offer as a puja (prayer): before you know it you'll be whisked to the ghats in a well-oiled hustle and asked for a personal donation of up to ₹1000. Some priests do genuinely live off the donations of others and this is a tradition that goes back centuries – but walk away if you feel bullied and always agree on a price before taking a red ribbon (a 'Pushkar passport') or flowers.
During the camel fair, Pushkar is besieged by pickpockets working the crowded bazaars. You can avoid the razor gang by not using thin-walled daypacks and by carrying your daypack in front of you. At any time of year, watch out for stray motorbikes in the bazaar.
8 Getting There & Away Frequent buses to/from Ajmer (
GOOGLE MAP
 ) (₹14, 30 minutes) stop on the road heading eastwards
out of town; other buses leave from the Marwar bus stand (
GOOGLE MAP
 ) to the north. A private taxi to Ajmer costs around ₹300
(note that it's almost always more expensive in the opposite direction). When entering Pushkar by car there is a toll of ₹20 per person.
Local travel agencies sell tickets for private buses – you should shop around. These buses generally leave from Ajmer, but the agencies should provide you with free connecting transport. Check whether your bus is direct as many services from Pushkar aren’t. And note, even if they are direct buses they may well stop for some time in Ajmer, meaning it’s often quicker to go to Ajmer first and then catch another bus from there.
8 Getting Around There are no autorickshaws, but it’s a breeze to get around on foot. If you want to explore the surrounding countryside, you could try hiring a scooter (₹250 per day) from one of the many places around town. For something more substantial,
try Shreeram Enfield Gairej ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Ajmer Rd; Enfield hire per day ₹500,
deposit ₹50,000). They hire Enfield Bullets for ₹500 per day and sell themfrom ₹60,000.
PUSHKAR CAMEL FAIR
Come the month of Kartika, the eighth lunar month of the Hindu calendar and one of the holiest, Thar camel drivers spruce up their ships of the desert and start the long walk to Pushkar in time for Kartik Purnima (Full Moon). Each year around 200,000 people converge here, bringing with them some 50,000 camels, horses and cattle. The place becomes an extraordinary swirl of colour, sound and movement, thronged with musicians, mystics, tourists, traders, animals, devotees and camera crews.
Trading begins a week before the official fair (a good time to arrive to see the serious business), but by the time the RTDC mela (fair) starts, business takes a back seat and the bizarre sidelines (snake charmers, children balancing on poles etc) jostle onto centre stage. Even the cultural program seems peculiar, with events such as a contest for the best moustache, and most beautifully decorated camel. Visitors are encouraged to take part: pick up a program from the RTDC office and see if you fancy joining the costumed wedding parade, or sign up for a 'Visitors versus Locals' sports contest such as traditional Rajasthani wrestling.
It’s hard to believe, but this seething mass is all just a sideshow. Kartik Purnima is when Hindu pilgrims come to bathe in Pushkar’s sacred waters. The religious event builds in tandem with the camel fair in a wild, magical crescendo of incense, chanting and processions to dousing day, the last night of the fair, when thousands of devotees wash away their sins and set candles afloat on the holy lake.
Although fantastical, mystical and a one-off, it must be said that it’s also crowded, touristy, noisy (light sleepers should bring earplugs) and occasionally tacky. Those affected by dust and/or animal hair should bring appropriate medication. However, it’s a grand epic and is not to be missed if you’re anywhere within camel-spitting distance.
It usually takes place in November, but dates change according to the lunar calendar.
Ranthambhore National Park
%07462
This famous national park ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h1 Oct-30 Jun) is the best place to
spot wild tigers in Rajasthan. Comprising 1334 sq km of wild jungle scrub hemmed in by rocky ridges, at its centre is the 10th-century Ranthambhore Fort. Scattered around the fort are ancient temples and mosques, hunting pavilions, crocodile-filled lakes and vine-covered chhatris (burial tombs). The park was amaharajas’ hunting ground until 1970, a curious 15 years after it had become a sanctuary. Tiger numbers are reasonably healthy for a park of Ranthambhore's size (around 48 when surveyed in 2014), but the threat of poaching remains, requiring constant vigilance to protect the big cats.
Seeing a tiger is partly a matter of luck; leave time for two or three safaris to improve your chances. But remember there’s plenty of other wildlife to see, including more than 300 species of bird.
It’s 10km from Sawai Madhopur (the gateway town for Ranthambhore) to the first gate of the park, and another 3km to the main gate and Ranthambhore Fort. There’s a bunch of cheap (and rather grotty) hotels near Sawai Madhopur train station, but the nicest accommodation is stretched out along Ranthambhore Rd, which eventually leads to the park.
It’s ₹50 to ₹100 for an auto from the train station to Ranthambhore Rd, depending on where you get off. Many hotels, though, will pick you up from the train station for free if you call ahead.
If you want to walk, turn left out of the train station and follow the road up to the overpass (200m). Turn left and cross the bridge over the railway line to reach a roundabout (200m), known as Hammir Circle. Turn right here to reach the Safari Booking Office (1.5km). But turn left to reach the better accommodation options.
2 Activities Safaris take place in the early morning and late afternoon, starting between 6am and 7am, and between 2pm and 3pm, depending on the time of year. Each safari lasts for around three hours. The mornings can be exceptionally chilly in the open vehicles, so bring warm clothes.
The best option is to travel by gypsy (six-person open-topped 4WD; per person Indian/foreigner ₹528/927). You have a chance of seeing a tiger from a canter (20-seat open-topped truck; Indian/foreigner ₹400/800), but other passengers can be rowdy. Be aware that the rules for booking safaris (and prices) are prone to change. At present, you have to book online through the park’sofficial website (www.rajasthanwildlife.in), which we highly recommend you do, or go in person to the Safari Booking Office, which is inconveniently located 1.5km from Hammir Circle, in the opposite direction to the park from the accommodation on Ranthambhore Rd. You cannot book safaris in person in advance of the day you want to do the safari (you can only do that online). To be sure of getting a seat in a vehicle, start queuing at least an hour (if not two) before the safaris are due to begin – a very early start for morning safaris!
To visit the magical 10th-century Ranthambhore Fort ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ;
h6am-6pm) on the cheap, join the locals who go there to visit the temple dedicated to Ganesh. Shared 4WDs (₹30 to ₹40 per person) leave from the train station for the park entrance – say ‘national park’ and they’ll know what you want. From there, other shared 4WDs (₹20 per person) shuttle to and from the fort, which is inside the park.
4 Sleeping Budget travellers may find the cheapest lodgings in Sawai Madhopur itself, but it isn’t a particularly inspiring place to stay. All of the places on Ranthambhore Rd can help with safari bookings, though some are better at this than others. Some hotels may close when the park is closed.

8 Getting There & Away
BUS
There are very few direct buses to anywhere of interest so it’s always preferable to take the train. Three direct buses leave for Bundi (₹93, five hours, 6am,
6.45am and 2pm) from the Tonk bus stand ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) (take the second
left out of the train station and the bus stand is on your right after the petrol station).
TRAIN
Trains run almost hourly to Kota (sleeper ₹100, less than two hours), from where you can catch buses to Bundi.
There are six daily trains to Jaipur (2nd class/sleeper ₹90/170, two hours; 2.05am, 5.55am, 9.40am, 10.40am, 2.35pm and 7.15pm), although plenty of others run on selected days so you rarely have to wait more than an hour. Ten trains run daily around the clock to Delhi (sleeper/3AC ₹250/635, 5½ to eight hours).
A daily train goes to Agra (Agra Fort station; sleeper ₹200, six hours, 11.15pm). For Keoladeo Ghana National Park, nine daily trains go to Bharatpur(sleeper/3AC ₹170/535, 2½ hours).
UDAIPUR & SOUTHERN RAJASTHAN
Bundi
%0747 / Pop 88,900
A captivating town with narrow lanes of Brahmin-blue houses, lakes, hills, bazaars and a temple at every turn, Bundi is dominated by a fantastical palace of faded parchment cupolas and loggias rising from the hillside above the town. Though an increasingly popular traveller hang-out, Bundi attracts nothing like the tourist crowds of Jaipur or Udaipur, nor are its streets choked with noisy, polluting vehicles or dense throngs of people. Few places in Rajasthan retain so much of the magical atmosphere of centuries past.
Bundi came into its own in the 12th century when a group of Chauhan nobles from Ajmer were pushed south by Mohammed of Ghori. They wrested the Bundi area from the Mina and Bhil tribes, and made Bundi the capital of their kingdom, known as Hadoti. Bundi was generally loyal to the Mughals from the late 16th century onwards, but it maintained its independent status until incorporated into the state of Rajasthan after 1947.Bundi

Bundi Palace
(Garh Palace; 5pm)
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹20/200, camera/video ₹50/100; h8am-
This extraordinary, partly decaying edifice – described by Rudyard Kipling as ‘the work of goblins rather than of men’ – almost seems to grow out of the rock of the hillside it stands on. Though large sections are still closed up and left to the bats, the rooms that are open hold a series of fabulous, fading turquoise-and- gold murals that are the palace’s chief treasure.
The palace was constructed during the reign of Rao Raja Ratan Ji Heruled (Ratan Singh; 1607–31) and added to by his successors.
If you are going up to Taragarh as well as the palace, get tickets for both at the palace entrance. Once inside the palace’s Hathi Pol (Elephant Gate), climb the stairs to the Ratan Daulat or Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), with a white marble coronation throne. You then pass into the Chhatra Mahal, added by Rao Raja Chhatra Shabji in 1644, with some fine but rather weathered murals. Stairs lead up to the Phool Mahal (1607), whose murals include an immense royal procession, and then the Badal Mahal (Cloud Palace; also 1607), with Bundi’s very best murals, including a wonderful Chinese-inspired ceiling, divided into petal shapes and decorated with peacocks and Krishnas.

To reach it, just continue on the path up behind the Chitrasala.
Jait Sagar
LAKE
 
Round the far side of the Taragarh hill, about 2km north from the centre of town, this picturesque, 1.5km-long lake is flanked by hills and strewn with pretty lotus flowers during the monsoon and winter months. At its near end, the SukhMahal ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h10am-5pm) is a small summer palace surrounded
by terraced gardens where Rudyard Kipling once stayed and wrote part of Kim. Just past the eastern end of the lake is the atmospheric, partly overgrown
Kshar Bag (Indian/foreigner ₹20/50, camera ₹50; h9am-5pm), with the cenotaphs of 66
Bundi rulers and queens. Some have terrific, intricate carvings, especially of elephants and horses. The caretaker will probably show you round and detail the rulers’ names, dates and number of wives – 17th-century ruler Maharaja Satru Sele apparently had 64 queens but even more are carved on his cenotaph. Fork right just after Kshar Bag to reach Shikar Burj, a small former royal hunting lodge (once there were tigers, deer and boars here) next to a water tank. It’s a popular place for a picnic.
It’s nice to visit Jait Sagar by bicycle; with a bike or autorickshaw you could combine it with other sights further out of town.

Kota
%0744 / Pop 703,150
An easy day trip from Bundi, Kota is a gritty industrial, commercial town on the Chamba, Rajasthan’s only permanent river. You can take boat trips along the river for some good bird-and crocodile-watching, or explore the city's old palace. It's best experienced as a day trip from Bundi.
1 Sights & Activities A lovely hiatus from the city is a Chambal River boat trip (per person 10min ₹60, 1hr ₹1000, max 6 people; h10.30am-dusk). The river upstream of Kota is part of the Darrah National Park and once you escape the city it’s beautiful, with lush vegetation and craggy cliffs on either side. It’s an opportunity to spot a host of birds, as well as gharials (thin-snouted, fish-eating crocodiles) and muggers (keep-your-limbs-inside-the-boat crocodiles). Boats startfrom Chambal Gardens (Indian/foreigner ₹2/5), 1.5km south of the fort on the river’s east bank.
City Palace & Fort
PALACE, FORT
(Indian/foreigner ₹30/200; h10am-4.30pm Sat-Thu)
The fort and the palace within it make up one of the largest such complexes in Rajasthan. This was the royal residence and centre of power, housing the Kota princedom’s treasury, courts, arsenal, armed forces and state offices. Some of its buildings are now used as schools. The City Palace, entered through a gateway topped by rampant elephants, contains the offbeat Rao Madho Singh
Museum (Indian/foreigner ₹10/100, camera ₹50; h10am-4.30pm), where you’ll find
everything for a respectable Raj existence, from silver furniture to weaponry, as well as perhaps India’s most depressingly moth-eaten stuffed trophy animals.
The oldest part of the palace dates from 1624. Downstairs is a durbar (royal audience) hall with beautiful mirrorwork, while the elegant, small-scale apartments upstairs contain exquisite, beautifully preserved paintings, particularly the hunting scenes for which Kota is renowned.
To get here, it’s around ₹30 to ₹40 in an autorickshaw from the bus stand, and at least ₹60 from the train station.
z Festivals & Events If you happen to hit Kota in October or November, check whether your visit coincides with the city’s huge Dussehra Mela, during which massive effigies are built then spectacularly set aflame. Thousands of pilgrims descend on the city in the month of Kartika (October/November) for Kashavrai Patan. See the tourist office for festival programs.

Chittorgarh (Chittor)
%01472 / Pop 96,200
Chittorgarh, the fort (garh) at Chittor, is the largest fort complex in India, and a fascinating place to explore. It rises from the plains like a huge rock island, nearly 6km long and surrounded on all sides by 150m-plus cliffs.Its history epitomises Rajput romanticism, chivalry and tragedy, and it holds a special place in the hearts of many Rajputs. Three times (in 1303, 1535 and 1568) Chittorgarh was under attack from a more powerful enemy; each time, its people chose death before dishonour, performing jauhar. The men donned saffron martyrs’ robes and rode out from the fort to certain death, while the women and children immolated themselves on huge funeral pyres. After the last of the three sackings, Rana Udai Singh II fled to Udaipur, where he established a new capital for Mewar. In 1616, Jehangir returned Chittor to the Rajputs. There was no attempt at resettlement, though it was restored in 1905.Chittorgarh (Chittor)

A zigzag ascent of more than 1km starts at Padal Pol and leads through six outer gateways to the main gate on the western side, the Ram Pol (the former back entrance). Inside Ram Pol is a still-occupied village that takes up a small northwestern part of the fort; turn right here for the ticket office. The rest of the plateau is deserted except for the wonderful palaces, towers and temples that remain from its heyday, with the addition of a few more recent temples. A loop road runs around the plateau, which has a deer park at the southern end.
Meera & Kumbha Shyam Temples
Both of these temples southeast of the Rana Kumbha Palace (

with classic, tall sikharas (spires). The Meera Temple (

Close to the Fateh Prakash Palace, Fort), the smaller of the two, is now associated with the mystic-poetess Meerabai, a 16th-century Mewar royal who was poisoned by her brother-in-law, but survived due to the blessings of Krishna. The Kumbha
Shyam Temple (

panels illustrate 15th-century Mewar life.
Tower of Victory
The glorious Tower of Victory (Jaya Stambha;

 ; Fort),
symbol of Chittorgarh, was erected by Rana Kumbha in the 1440s, probably to commemorate a victory over Mahmud Khilji of Malwa. Dedicated to Vishnu, it rises 37m in nine exquisitely carved storeys, and you can climb the 157 narrow stairs (the interior is also carved) to the 8th floor, from where there’s a good view of the area.
Below the tower, to the southwest, is the Mahasati (

Gaumukh Reservoir
Walk down beyond the Samidheshwar Temple and at the edge of the cliff is a deep tank, the Gaumukh Reservoir, where you can feed the fish. The reservoir takes its name from a spring that feeds the tank from a gaumukh (cow’s mouth) carved into the cliffside.
Padmini’s Palace
Continuing south, you reach the Kalika Mata Temple (

then converted to a temple for the goddess Kali in the 14th century. Padmini’s

small lake with a central pavilion. The bronze gates to this pavilion were carried off by Akbar and can now be seen in Agra Fort.

(Kirtti Stambha;

 ; Fort), dating from 1301, is smaller than the
Tower of Victory. Built by a Jain merchant, the tower is dedicated to Adinath, the first Jain tirthankar (one of the 24 revered Jain teachers) and is decorated with naked figures of various other tirthankars, indicating that it is a monument of the Digambara (sky-clad) order. A narrow stairway leads up the seven storeys to the top. Next door is a 14th-century Jain temple.

Udaipur
%0294 / Pop 389,400
Beside shimmering Lake Pichola, with the ochre and purple ridges of the wooded Aravalli Hills stretching away in every direction, Udaipur has a romantic setting unmatched in Rajasthan and arguably in all of India. Fantastical palaces, temples, havelis and countless narrow, crooked, colourful streets add the human counterpoint to the city’s natural charms.
Udaipur's tag of ‘the most romantic spot on the continent of India’ was first applied in 1829 by Colonel James Tod, the East India Company’s first Political Agent in the region. Today the romance is wearing ever so slightly thin as Udaipur strains to exploit it for tourist rupees. In the parts of the city nearest the lake, almost every building is a hotel, shop, restaurant, travel agent, or all four rolled into one. Ever-taller hotels compete for the best view, too many mediocre restaurants serve up near-identical menus, and noisy, dirty traffic clogs some of
h               h                 d  f            l      dd   kthe streets that were made for people and donkeys.
Take a step back from the hustle, however, and Udaipur still has its magic, not just in its marvellous palaces and monuments, but in its matchless setting, the tranquility of boat rides on the lake, the bustle of its ancient bazaars, its lively arts scene, the quaint old-world feel of its better hotels, its endless tempting shops and some lovely countryside to explore on wheels, feet or horseback.
Udaipur was founded in 1568 by Maharana Udai Singh II following the final sacking of Chittorgarh by the Mughal emperor Akbar. Though this new capital of Mewar had a much less vulnerable location than Chittorgarh. Mewar still had to contend with repeated invasions by the Mughals and, later, the Marathas, until British intervention in the early 19th century. This resulted in a treaty that protected Udaipur from invaders while allowing Mewar’s rulers to remain effectively all-powerful in internal affairs. The ex-royal family remains influential and in recent decades has been the driving force behind the rise of Udaipur as a tourist destination.Udaipur

Lake Pichola
LAKE
 
Limpid and large, Lake Pichola reflects the cool grey-blue mountains on its rippling mirror-like surface. It was enlarged by Maharana Udai Singh II, following his foundation of the city, by flooding Picholi village, which gave the lake its name. The lake is now 4km long and 3km wide, but remains shallow and dries up completely during severe droughts. The City Palace complex, including the gardens at its southern end, extends nearly 1km along the lake’s eastern shore.

The trips make a stop at Jagmandir Island, where you can stay for as long as you like before taking any boat back. Take your own drinks and snacks, though, as those sold on the island are extortionately expensive. You can also take 30-minute boat rides (₹250 perperson) from Lal Ghat throughout the day, without the need to enter the City Palace complex: it’s worth checking in advance what time the popular sunset departure casts off.

Surmounted by balconies, towers and cupolas towering over the lake, the imposing City Palace is Rajasthan’s largest palace, with a facade 244m long and 30.4m high. Construction was begun in 1599 by Maharana Udai Singh II, the city’s founder, and it later became a conglomeration of structures (including 11 separate smaller palaces) built and extended by various maharanas, though it still manages to retain a surprising uniformity of design.

It’s entered from Ganesh Chowk, which you reach from Manek Chowk.The City Palace Museum begins with the Rai Angan (Royal Courtyard), the very spot where Udai Singh met the sage who told him to build a city here. Rooms along one side contain historical paintings, including several of the Battle of Haldighati (1576), in which Mewar forces under Maharana Pratap, one of the great Rajput heroes, gallantly fought the army of Mughal emperor Akbar to a stalemate.
As you move through the palace, highlights include the Baadi Mahal (1699), where a pretty, central garden gives fine views over the city. Kishan (Krishna) Vilas has a remarkable collection of miniatures from the time of Maharana Bhim Singh (1778–1828). The story goes that Bhim Singh’s daughter Krishna Kumari drank a fatal cup of poison here to solve the dilemma of rival princely suitors from Jaipur and Jodhpur, who were both threatening to invade Mewar if she didn’t marry them. The Surya Choupad boasts a huge, ornamental sun (the symbol of the sun-descended Mewar dynasty) and opens into Mor Chowk (Peacock Courtyard) with its lovely mosaics of peacocks, the favourite Rajasthani bird.
The southern end of the museum comprises the Zenana Mahal, the royal ladies’ quarters built in the 17th century. It now contains a long picture gallery with lots of royal hunting scenes (note the comic strip-like progression of the action in each painting). The Zenana Mahal’s central courtyard, Laxmi Chowk, contains a beautiful white pavilion and a stable of howdahs, palanquins and other people carriers.

The Crystal Gallery houses rare crystal that Maharana Sajjan Singh ordered from F&C Osler & Co in England in 1877. The maharana died before it arrived, and all the items stayed forgotten and packed up in boxes for 110 years. The extraordinary, extravagant collection includes crystal chairs, sofas, tables and even beds. The rather hefty admission fee also includes entry to the grand

Reached by a steep, elephant-flanked flight of steps, 150m north of the City Palace’s Badi Pol entrance, this busy Indo-Aryan temple was built by Maharana Jagat Singh in 1651. The wonderfully carved main structure enshrines a black stone image of Vishnu as Jagannath, Lord of the Universe. There’s also a brass image of the Garuda (Vishnu’s man-bird vehicle) in a shrine facing the main structure.

This gracious 18th-century haveli, set on the water’s edge in the Gangaur Ghat area, was built by a Mewar prime minister and has since been carefully restored. There are 138 rooms set around courtyards, some arranged to evoke the period during which the house was inhabited, while others house cultural displays, including – intriguingly enough – the world’s biggest turban.
The haveli also houses a gallery featuring a fascinating collection of period photos of Udaipur and a surreal collection of world-famous monuments carved out of polystyrene.
Sajjan Garh
(Monsoon Palace)
PALACE
Perched on top of a distant mountain like a fairy-tale castle, this melancholy, neglected late 19th-century palace was constructed by Maharana Sajjan Singh. Originally an astronomical centre, it became a monsoon palace and huntinglodge. Now government owned, it’s in a sadly dilapidated state, but visitors stream up here for the marvellous views, particularly at sunset. It’s 5km west of the old city as the crow flies, about 9km by the winding road.
At the foot of the hill you enter the 5-sq-km Sajjan Garh Wildlife
Sanctuary (Indian/foreigner ₹20/160, car ₹60, camera/video free/₹200). A good way to visit
is with the daily sunset excursion in a minivan driven by an enterprising taxi driver who picks up tourists at the entrance to Bagore-ki-Haveli at Gangaur Ghat every day at 5pm. The round trip costs ₹200 per person, including waiting time (but not the sanctuary fees). His minivan has ‘Monsoon Palace–Sajjangarh Fort’ written across the front of it. Alternatively, autorickshaws charge ₹200, including waiting time, for a round trip to the sanctuary gate, which they are not allowed to pass. Taxis ferry people the final 4km up to the palace for ₹100 per person.

The maharanas’ car collection makes a fascinating diversion, for what it tells about their elite lifestyle and for the vintage vehicles themselves. Housed within the former state garage are 22 splendid vehicles, including a seven-seat 1938 Cadillac, complete with purdah system, the beautiful 1934 Rolls-Royce Phantom used in the Bond film Octopussy, and the Cadillac convertible that whisked Queen Elizabeth II to the airport in 1961. The museum is a 10-minute walk east along Lake Palace Rd (bear to the right at the staggered junction).
If you enjoy a vegetarian thali, the combined museum-and-meal ticket is a very good option (lunch 11.30am to 3pm, dinner 7.30pm to 10pm).
DON'T MISS
DURBAR GLITZ
Many palaces in India have a durbar hall (royal reception hall). Usually the grandest room in the place, with a respectable number of chandeliers and gilt overlay, the durbar hall was dressed to impress – it was used by Indian rulers for official occasions, such as state banquets, and to hold meetings.The restored Durbar Hall in the City Palace complex is one of India’s most impressive, vast and lavish, with some of the country’s biggest chandeliers. The walls display royal weapons and striking portraits of former maharanas of Mewar – a most distinguished- looking lot, who come from what is believed to be the oldest ruling dynasty in the world, spanning 76 generations.
The foundation stone of the hall was laid in 1909 by Lord Minto, the viceroy of India, during the reign of Maharana Fateh Singh, and it was originally named Minto Hall. The upper level of this high-ceilinged hall is surrounded by viewing galleries, where ladies of the palace could watch, in veiled seclusion, what was happening below. Nowadays, these are the Crystal Gallery.
The Durbar Hall is included in visits to the Crystal Gallery and you will also see it if you
go to the Gallery Restaurant (

z Festivals & Events If you’re in Udaipur in February or March, you can experience the festival of Holi Udaipur- style, when the town comes alive in a riot of colour. Holi is followed by the procession-heavy Mewar Festival

This area is a tangle of streets and lanes (some quiet, some busy and noisy), close to the City Palace and Jagdish Temple. It’s Udaipur’s tourist epicentre and the streets are strung not just with lodgings but also with tourist-oriented eateries and shops whose owners will be doing their best to tempt you in.
Directly across the water from Lal Ghat, Hanuman Ghat has a slightly more local vibe and often better views, though you’re certainly not out of the tourist zone.

Fifteen centuries of intriguing Mewar history are squeezed into one atmospheric hour of commentary and light switching – in English from September to April, in Hindi other months.
7 Shopping Tourist-oriented shops selling miniature paintings, wood carvings, silver and other jewellery, bangles, traditional shoes, spices, leather-bound, handmade-paper notebooks, ornate knives, camel-boneboxes and a large variety of textiles line the streets radiating from Jagdish Chowk. Udaipur is known for its local crafts, particularly its miniature paintings in the Rajput-Mughal style, as well as some interesting contemporary art.
The local market area extends east from the old clock tower (

 ) at the north end of Jagdish Temple Rd, and buzzes loudest in the
evening. It’s fascinating as much for browsing and soaking up local atmosphere as for buying. Bara Bazar, immediately east of the old clock tower, sells silver and gold, while its narrow side street, Maldas St, specialises in saris and fabrics. A little further east, traditional shoes are sold on Mochiwada. Foodstuffs and spices are mainly found around the new clock tower at the east end of the bazaar area, and at Mandi Market, about 200m north of the tower.

Around Udaipur
Kumbhalgarh
%02954
About 80km north of Udaipur, Kumbhalgarh (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, Light & Sound Show ₹200; h9am-6pm, Light & Sound Show 6.30pm) is a fantastic, remote fort, fulfilling
romantic expectations and vividly summoning up the chivalrous, warlike Rajput era. One of the many forts built by Rana Kumbha (r 1433–68), under whom Mewar reached its greatest extents, the isolated fort is perched 1100m above sea level, with endless views melting into the blue distance. The journey to the fort, along twisting roads through the Aravalli Hills, is a highlight in itself.
Kumbhalgarh was the most important Mewar fort after Chittorgarh, and the rulers, sensibly, used to retreat here in times of danger. Not surprisingly, Kumbhalgarh was only taken once in its entire history. Even then, it took the combined armies of Amber, Marwar and Mughal emperor Akbar to breach its strong defences, and they only managed to hang on to it for two days.
The fort’s thick walls stretch about 36km; they’re wide enough in some places for eight horses to ride abreast and it’s possible to walk right around the circuit (allow two days). They enclose around 360 intact and ruined temples, some of which date back to the Mauryan period in the 2nd century BC, as well as palaces  gardens  step-wells and 700 cannon bunkerspalaces, gardens, step-wells and 700 cannon bunkers.
If you are staying here and want to make an early start on your hike around the wall, you can get into the fort before 9am, although no one will be around to sell you a ticket.
There’s a light-and-sound show (₹200) at the fort every evening at 6.30pm. The large and rugged Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary can be visited from Kumbhalgarh.
Ask at the Aodhi hotel about organising 4WD, horse or walking trips in the sanctuary.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
KUMBHALGARH WILDLIFE SANCTUARY
Ranakpur is a great base for exploring the hilly, densely forested Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary (Indian/foreigner ₹20/180, 4WD or car ₹150, camera/video free/₹400, guide per day ₹200; hdawn-dusk), which extends over some 600 sq km to the northeast and southwest. It’s known for its leopards and wolves, although the chances of spotting antelopes, gazelles, deer and possibly sloth bears are higher, especially from March to June. You will certainly see some of the sanctuary’s 200-plus bird species.
There are several safari outfits on the road leading up to Kumbhalgarh Fort (don't believe posters suggesting tiger sightings), but some of the best safaris and treks are offered (to guests and nonguests) by Shivika Lake Hotel: options include three-hour 4WD safaris (₹850 per person), a three-hour forest and lake walk (₹350), a six-to-seven–hour round-trip walk leading to Parshuram Shiva Temple (₹650), and a one-way hike to Kumbhalgarh (₹850, about five hours), with a two-person minimum and park fees included.
Note, there is a ticket office for the sanctuary right beside where the bus drops you off for the Jain temples, but the nearest of the sanctuary’s four entrances is 2km beyond here, near Shivika Lake Hotel.

Just under 2km from the fort is this luxurious and blissfully tranquil hotel with an inviting pool, rambling gardens and winter campfires. The spacious rooms, in stone buildings, all boast their own palm-thatched terraces, balconies or pavilions, and assorted wildlife and botanical art and photos.
Nonguests can dine in the restaurant, where good standard Indian fare is the pick of the options on offer, or have a drink in the cosy Chowpal Bar. Room rates plummet from April to September.
8 Getting There & Away From Udaipur’s main bus stand, catch an hourly Ranakpur-bound bus as far as Saira (₹57, 2¼ hours), a tiny crossroads town where you can change for a bus to Kumbhalgarh (₹30, one hour, hourly). That bus, which will be bound for Kelwara, will drop you at the start of the approach road to the fort, leaving you with a pleasant 1.5km walk to the entrance gate.
The last bus back to Saira swings by at 5.30pm (and is always absolutely jam- packed with villagers). The last bus from Saira back to Udaipur leaves at around 8pm.
To get to Ranakpur from Kumbhalgarh, head first to Saira then change for Ranakpur (₹14, 40 minutes, at least hourly).
A day-long round trip in a private car from Udaipur to Kumbhalgarh and Ranakpur will cost around ₹1800 per car.
Ranakpur
%02934
Ranakpur
JAIN TEMPLE(camera/video ₹100/300; hJains 6am-7pm, non-Jains noon-5pm)
At the foot of a steep wooded escarpment of the Aravalli Hills, Ranakpur is one of India’s biggest and most important Jain temple complexes. It’s 75km northwest of Udaipur, and 12km west of Kumbhalgarh as the crow flies (but 50km by road, via Saira). Chaumukha Mandir (Four-Faced Temple), the main temple, is dedicated to Adinath, the first Jain tirthankar (depicted in the many Buddha-like images in the temple), and was built in the 15th century in milk- white marble.
An incredible feat of Jain devotion, the Chaumukha Mandir is a complicated series of 29 halls, 80 domes and 1444 individually engraved pillars. The interior is completely covered in knotted, lovingly wrought carving, and has a marvellously calming sense of space and harmony. Shoes, cigarettes, food and all leather articles must be left at the entrance; women who are menstruating are asked not to enter.
Also exquisitely carved and well worth inspecting are two other Jain temples, dedicated to Neminath (22nd tirthankar) and Parasnath (23rd tirthankar), both within the complex, and a nearby Sun Temple. About 1km from the main complex is the Amba Mata Temple.
Buses from Udaipur and Saira will drop you by the entrance to the temple complex, before continuing past Shivika Lake Hotel (2km), and then going on to Jodhpur.

Shivika Lake Hotel

GUESTHOUSE
Two kilometres north of the temple, Shivika is a welcoming, rustic and family- run hotel that provides free pick-ups and drop-offs at the bus stop near the temple. You can stay in small, cosy rooms amid leafy gardens, or safari-style tents. Two of the tents have prime positions beside beautiful Nalwania Lake, on the edge of the property.
Due to the presence of a few crocodiles, the lake isn’t safe for swimming, but there’s a swimming pool right beside it and some meals (mains ₹70 to ₹160,thali ₹170, buffet lunch ₹300) are served here too.
8 Getting There & Away There are direct buses to Ranakpur from the main bus stands in both Udaipur (₹68, three hours, hourly) and Jodhpur (₹139, four to five hours). You’ll be dropped outside the temple complex unless you state otherwise. Return services start drying up at around 7pm.
A day-long round trip in a private car from Udaipur to Ranakpur and Kumbhalgarh costs around ₹1800.
Mt Abu
%02974 Pop 22,200 Elev 1200m
Rajasthan’s only hill station sits among green forests on the state’s highest mountain at the southwestern end of the Aravalli Range, close to the Gujarat border. Quite unlike anywhere else in Rajasthan, Mt Abu provides Rajasthanis, Gujaratis and a steady flow of foreign tourists with respite from the scorching temperatures and arid, beige terrain found elsewhere. It’s a particular hit with honeymooners and middle-class families from Gujarat.
Mt Abu town sits towards the southwest end of the plateau-like upper part of the mountain, which stretches about 19km from end to end and 6km from east to west. The town is surrounded by the flora-and fauna-rich, 289-sq-km Mt Abu Wildlife Sanctuary, which extends over most of the mountain from an altitude of 300m upwards.
The mountain is of great spiritual importance for both Hindus and Jains and has over 80 temples and shrines, most notably the exquisite Jain temples at Delwara, built between 400 and 1000 years ago.
Try to avoid arriving in Diwali (October or November) or the following two weeks, when prices soar and the place is packed. Mt Abu also gets pretty busy from mid-May to mid-June, before the monsoon. This is when the Summer Festival hits town, with music, fireworks and boat races. In the cooler months, you'll find everyone wrapped up in shawls and hats; pack something woolly to avoid winter chills in poorly heated hotel rooms.Mt Abu

Nakki Lake
LAKE
 
Scenic Nakki Lake, the town’s focus, is one of Mt Abu’s biggest attractions. It’s so named because, according to legend, it was scooped out by a god using his nakh (nails). Some Hindus thus consider it a holy lake. Another version of its origins is that it was constructed by the British in the 19th century.
It’s a pleasant 45-minute stroll around the perimeter – the lake is surrounded
by hills, parks and strange rock formations. The best known, Toad Rock (

This is a world of isolated shrines and lakes, weird rock formations, fantastic panoramas, nomadic villagers, orchids, wild fruits, plants used in ayurvedic medicine, sloth bears (which are fairly common), wild boars, langurs, 150 bird species and even the occasional leopard.

DELWARA TEMPLES
Delwara Temples
(donations welcome; hJains 6am-6pm, non-Jains noon-6pm)
JAIN TEMPLE
These remarkable Jain temples are Mt Abu’s most remarkable attraction and feature some of India’s finest temple decoration. They predate the town of Mt Abu by many centuries and were built when this site was just a remote mountain vastness. It’s said that the artisans were paid according to the amount of dust they collected, encouraging them to carve ever more intricately. Whatever their inducement, there are two temples here in which the marble work is dizzyingly intense.The older of the two is the Vimal Vasahi, on which work began in 1031 and was financed by a Gujarati chief minister named Vimal. Dedicated to the first tirthankar, Adinath, it took 1500 masons and 1200 labourers 14 years to build, and allegedly cost ₹185.3 million. Outside the entrance is the House of Elephants, featuring a procession of stone elephants marching to the temple, some of which were damaged long ago by marauding Mughals. Inside, a forest of beautifully carved pillars surrounds the central shrine, which holds an image of Adinath himself.
The Luna Vasahi Temple is dedicated to Neminath, the 22nd tirthankar, and was built in 1230 by the brothers Tejpal and Vastupal for a mere ₹125.3 million. Like Vimal, the brothers were both Gujarati government ministers. The marble carving here took 2500 workers 15 years to create, and its most notable feature is its intricacy and delicacy, which is so fine that, in places, the marble becomes almost transparent. The many- layered lotus flower that dangles from the centre of the dome is a particularly astonishing piece of work.
As at other Jain temples, leather articles (including belts and shoes) cameras and phones must be left at the entrance, and menstruating women are asked not to enter.
Delwara is about 3km north of Mt Abu town centre: you can walk there in less than an hour, or hop aboard a shared taxi (₹10 per person) from up the street opposite Chacha Cafe. A taxi all to yourself should be ₹100, or ₹200 round-trip with one hour’s waiting.
4 Sleeping Room rates can double (or worse) during the peak seasons – mid-May to mid-June, Diwali and Christmas/New Year – but generous discounts are often available at other times in midrange and top-end places. If you have to come here at Diwali, you’ll need to book way ahead and you won’t be able to move for crowds. Many hotels have an ungenerous 9am check-out time.

A road goes almost all the way to the summit where you'll find the Atri Rishi Temple, complete with a priest and fantastic, huge views. A popular spot, it’s a highlight of the RSRTC tour; if you decide to go it alone, a 4WD will cost ₹500 return.
NORTHERN RAJASTHAN (SHEKHAWATI)
Far less visited than other parts of Rajasthan, the Shekhawati region is most famous for its extraordinary painted havelis (traditional, ornately decorated residences that enclose one or more courtyards), highlighted with dazzling, often whimsical, murals. Part of the region’s appeal and mystique is due to these works of art being found in tiny towns, connected to each other by single-track roads that run through lonely, arid countryside. Today it seems curious that suchcare, attention and money was lavished on these out-of-the-way houses, but from the 14th century onwards Shekhawati’s towns were important trading posts on the caravan routes from Gujarati ports.
What makes the artwork on Shekhawati’s havelis so fascinating is the manner in which their artists combined traditional subjects, such as mythology, religious scenes and images of the family, with contemporary concerns, including brand- new inventions and accounts of current events, many of which these isolated painters rendered straight from their imaginations.

SHEKHAWATI’S OUTDOOR GALLERIES
In the 18th and 19th centuries, shrewd Marwari merchants lived frugally and far from home while earning money in India’s new commercial centres. They sent the bulk of their vast fortunes back to their families in Shekhawati to construct grand havelis to show their neighbours how well they were doing and to compensate their families for their long absences. Merchants competed with one another to build ever more grand edifices (homes, temples, step-wells), which were richly decorated, both inside and out, with painted murals.
The artists responsible for these acres of decoration largely belonged to the caste of kumhars (potters) and were both the builders and painters of the havelis. Known as chajeras (masons), many were commissioned from beyond Shekhawati – particularly from Jaipur, where they had been employed decorating the new capital’s palaces – and others flooded in from further afield to offer their skills. Soon, there was a cross- pollination of ideas and techniques, with local artists learning from the new arrivals.
The early paintings are strongly influenced by Mughal decoration, with floral arabesques and geometric designs. The Rajput royal courts were the next major influence; scenes from Hindu mythology are prevalent – Krishna is particularly popular.
With the arrival of Europeans, walls were embellished with paintings of the newt   t  e a    va  o    u opea  s,   a s   e e e   be  s  ed    t   pa   t   gs o  t  e   e technological marvels to which the Shekhawati merchants had been exposed to in centres such as Calcutta. Pictures of trains, planes, telephones, gramophones and bicycles featured, often painted directly from the artist’s imagination. The British are invariably depicted as soldiers, with dogs or holding bottles of booze.
Haveli walls were frequently painted by the chajeras from the ground to the eaves. Often the paintings mix depictions of the gods and their lives with everyday scenes featuring modern inventions, such as trains and aeroplanes, even though these artists themselves had never seen them. Hence, Krishna and Radha are seen in flying motorcars and Europeans can be observed inflating hot-air balloons by blowing into them.
These days most of the havelis are still owned by descendants of the original families, but not inhabited by their owners, for whom small-town Rajasthan has lost its charm. Many are occupied by a single chowkidar (caretaker), while others may be home to a local family. Though they are pale reflections of the time when they accommodated the large households of the Marwari merchant families, they remain a fascinating testament to the changing times in which they were created. Only a few havelis have been restored; many more lie derelict, crumbling slowly away.
For a full rundown on the history, people, towns and buildings of the area, track down a copy of The Painted Towns of Shekhawati, by Ilay Cooper, an excellent book that can be picked up at bookshops in the region or Jaipur.

WESTERN RAJASTHAN
Jodhpur
%0291 / Pop 1,033,900
Mighty Mehrangarh, the muscular fort that towers over the Blue City of Jodhpur, is a magnificent spectacle and an architectural masterpiece. Around Mehrangarh’s base, the old city, a jumble of Brahmin-blue cubes, stretches out to the 10km-long, 16th-century city wall. Inside is a tangle of winding, glittering, medieval streets, which never seem to lead where you expect them to, scented by incense, roses and sewers, with shops and bazaars selling everything from trumpets and temple decorations to snuff and saris.
Traditionally, blue signified the home of a Brahmin, but non-Brahmins have got in on the act too. As well as glowing with a mysterious light, the blue tint is thought to repel insects.
Modern Jodhpur stretches well beyond the city walls, but it’s the immediacy and buzz of the old Blue City and the larger-than-life fort that capture travellers’ imaginations. This crowded, hectic zone is Jodhpur’s main tourist area, and it often seems you can’t speak to anyone without them trying to sell you something. Areas of the old city further west, such as Navchokiya, are just as atmospheric, with far less hustling.
History
Driven from their homeland of Kannauj, east of Agra, by Afghans serving Mohammed of Ghori, the Rathore Rajputs fled west around AD 1200 to the region around Pali, 70km southeast of Jodhpur. They prospered to such a degree that in 1381 they managed to oust the Pratiharas of Mandore, 9km north of present-day Jodhpur. In 1459 the Rathore leader Rao Jodha chose a nearby rocky ridge as the site for a new fortress of staggering proportions, Mehrangarh, around which grew Jodha’s city: Jodhpur.g
yp
Jodhpur lay on the vital trade route between Delhi and Gujarat. The Rathore kingdom grew on the profits of sandalwood, opium, dates and copper, and controlled a large area that became cheerily known as Marwar (the Land of Death), due to its harsh topography and climate. It stretched as far west as what’s now the India–Pakistan border area, and bordered with Mewar (Udaipur) in the south, Jaisalmer in the northwest, Bikaner in the north, and Jaipur and Ajmer in the east.

Rising perpendicular and impregnable from a rocky hill that itself stands 120m above Jodhpur’s skyline, Mehrangarh is one of the most magnificent forts in India. The battlements are 6m to 36m high, and as the building materials were chiselled from the rock on which the fort stands, the structure merges with its base. Still run by the Jodhpur royal family, Mehrangarh is packed with history and legend. Mehrangarh’s main entrance is at the northeast gate, Jai Pol (

section.
It’s about a 300m walk up from the old city to the entrance, or you can take a winding 5km autorickshaw ride (around ₹100). The superb audio guide (available in 11 languages) is included with the museum ticket, but bring ID or a credit card as deposit.
Jai Pol was built by Maharaja Man Singh in 1808 following his defeat of
invading forces from Jaipur. Past the museum ticket office (

and a small cafe, the 16th-century Dodh Kangra Pol was an external gate before Jai Pol was built, and still bears the scars of 1808 cannonball hits. Through here, the main route heads up to the left through the 16th-century Imritia Pol and then Loha Pol, the fort’s original entrance, with iron spikes to deter enemy elephants. Just inside the gate are two sets of small hand prints, the sati marks of royal widows who threw themselves on their maharajas’ funeral pyres – the last to do so were Maharaja Man Singh’s widows in 1843.
Past Loha Pol you’ll find a restaurant and Suraj Pol, which gives access to the museum. Once you’ve visited the museum, continue on from here to thepanoramic ramparts, which are lined with impressive antique artillery.

to the Chokelao Bagh (

 ), a restored and gorgeously
planted 18th-century Rajput garden (you could lose an afternoon here lolling under shady trees reading a book), and the Fateh Pol (Victory Gate;

 ). You can exit here into the old city quarter of Navchokiya.
Museum
This beautiful network of stone-latticed courtyards and halls, formerly the fort’s palace, is a superb example of Rajput architecture, so finely carved that it
often looks more like sandalwood than sandstone. The galleries ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ) around Shringar Chowk (Anointment Courtyard) display
India’s best collection of elephant howdahs and Jodhpur’s royal palanquin collection.
One of the two galleries off Daulat Khana Chowk displays textiles, paintings, manuscripts, headgear and the curved sword of the Mughal emperor Akbar; the other gallery is the armoury. Upstairs is a fabulous gallery of miniature paintings from the sophisticated Marwar school and the beautiful 18th-century Phul Mahal (Flower Palace), with 19th-century wall paintings depicting the 36 moods of classical ragas as well as royal portraits; the artist took 10 years to create them using a curious concoction of gold leaf, glue and cow’s urine.
Takhat Vilas was the bedchamber of Maharaja Takhat Singh (r 1843–73), who had just 30 maharanis and numerous concubines. Its beautiful ceiling is covered with Christmas baubles. You then enter the extensive zenana, whose lovely latticed windows (from which the women could watch the goings-on in the courtyards) are said to feature over 250 different designs. Here you’ll find the Cradle Gallery, exhibiting the elaborate cradles of infant princes, and the 17th-century Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace), which was the palace’s main durbar hall (royal reception hall) for official meetings and receptions, with gorgeously colourful stained glass.

This 72-hectare park – and model of intelligent ecotourism – sits in the lee of Mehrangarh. It has been lovingly restored and planted with native species to show the natural diversity of the region. The park is criss-crossed with walking trails that take you up to the city walls, around Devkund Lake, spotting local birds, butterflies and reptiles. For an extra insight into the area’s native flora and fauna, take along one of the excellent local guides.
Walks here are the perfect restorative if the Indian hustle has left you in need of breathing space. Visit early in the morning or in the late afternoon for the most pleasant temperatures. The visitors centre is thoughtfully put together, and there’s a small cafe too.
Jaswant Thada
HISTORIC BUILDING
( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹15/30, camera/video ₹25/50; h9am-5pm)
This milky-white marble memorial to Maharaja Jaswant Singh II, sitting above a small lake 1km northeast of Mehrangarh, is an array of whimsical domes. It’s a welcome, peaceful spot after the hubbub of the city, and the views across to the fort and over the city are superb. Built in 1899, the cenotaph has some beautiful jalis (carved marble lattice screens) and is hung with portraits of Rathore rulers going back to the 13th century.
Look out for the memorial to a peacock that flew into a funeral pyre.
Clock Tower
MONUMENT

The century-old clock tower is an old city landmark surrounded by the vibrant sounds, sights and smells of Sardar Market, which is marked by triple gateways at its northern and southern ends. The narrow, winding lanes of the old city spread out in all directions from here. Westward, you plunge into the old city’s commercial heart, with crowded alleys and bazaars selling vegetables, spices, sweets, silver and handicrafts.
Umaid Bhawan Palace
PALACE( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; museum Indian/foreigner ₹25/60; hmuseum 9am-5pm)
Take an autorickshaw to this hilltop palace, 3km southeast of the old city. The current royal incumbent, Gaj Singh II, still lives in part of the building. Built in 1929, the 365-room edifice was designed by the British architect Henry Lanchester for Maharaja Umaid Singh. It took more than 3000 workers 15 years to complete, at a cost of around ₹11 million.
The building is mortarless, and incorporates 100 wagon-loads of Makrana marble and Burmese teak in the interior. Apparently its construction began as a royal job-creation program during a time of severe drought. Much of the building has been turned into a suitably grand hotel.
Casual visitors are not welcome at either the royal residence or the hotel, but you can visit the museum, housed in one side of the building. It includes photos showing the elegant art deco design of the palace interior, plus an eccentric collection of elaborate clocks. Don’t miss the maharaja’s highly polished classic cars, displayed in front of the museum, by the entrance gate.

This circuit of six zip-lines flies back and forth over walls, bastions and lakes on the northern side of Mehrangarh. A brief training session is given before you start and safety standards are good: awesome is the verdict of most who dare. Flying Fox has a desk near the main ticket office and its starting point is in the Chokelao Bagh. Tours last up to 1½ hours, depending on the group size. Book online for a discount on the walk-up price.
z Festivals & Events Jodhpur's colourful Marwar Festival (hSep/Oct ), which includes polo and a camel tattoo, coincides with the excellent Rajasthan International Folk Festival (www.jodhpurriff.org; hSep/Oct), five days of music concerts by Indian and international artists held at Mehrangarh. This most spectacular of music venues also hosts the Jodhpur Flamenco and Gypsy Festival(http://jfgfestival.com; hApr).
4 Sleeping The old city has something like 100 guesthouses, most of which scramble for your custom as soon as you get within breathing distance of Sardar Market.
If a rickshaw rider or friendly local is clamouring to take you to a particular guesthouse or hotel, it’s probably because he is aiming to receive a commission from them. There’s a growing anti-commission movement among hoteliers here, but many still pay touts, or your rickshaw/taxi driver an absurd 50% of what you pay for your room. Don’t believe drivers or strangers on the street who tell you the place you want has closed, is full, is under repair, is far from the centre etc.
Many lodgings can organise a pick-up from the train station or bus stops, even at night, if you call ahead. Otherwise, for most places in the old city you can avoid nonsense by getting dropped at the clock tower and walking from there.

It’s not often you get to lay your head down in a converted Hindu temple, but Nirvan Hotel gives you the chance. Rooms run off a lovely courtyard thick with pot plants, and although windows face inside, your views are instead of original 150-year-old temple frescoes (fixtures and fittings are thankfully newer).

7 Shopping Plenty of Rajasthani handicrafts are available, with shops selling textiles and other wares clustered around Sardar Market and along Nai Sarak (you’ll need to bargain hard).
Jodhpur is famous for antiques, with a concentration of showrooms along Palace Rd, 2km southeast of the centre. These warehouse-sized shops are fascinating to wander around, but they’re well known to Western antiques dealers, so you’ll be hard-pressed to find any bargains. Also remember that the trade in antique architectural fixtures may be contributing to the desecration of India’s cultural heritage (beautiful old havelis are often ripped apart for their doors and window frames), and restrictions apply to the export of items over 100 years old. However, most showrooms deal in antique reproductions, and can make a piece of antique-style furniture and ship it home for you. The best bets
for quality replica antiques are Ajay Art Emporium ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Palace Rd;
h10am-7pm) or Rani Handicrafts (

shops also have more portable (often less expensive) items than furniture, such as textiles, carvings and silverware.MV Spices

JODHPUR’S JODHPURS
A fashion staple for self-respecting horsey people all around the world, jodhpurs are riding breeches – usually of a pale cream colour – that are loose above the knee and tapered from knee to ankle. It’s said that Sir Pratap Singh, a legendary Jodhpur statesman, soldier and horseman, originally designed the breeches for the Jodhpur Lancers. When he led the Jodhpur polo team on a tour to England in 1897, the design caught on in London and then spread around the world.

You need to arrive at the station six hours before departure – the same amount of time it takes to reach the sole stop of Munabao on the border. There you undergo lengthy border procedures before continuing on to Karachi (assuming you have a Pakistan visa) in a Pakistani train, arriving about 2am on Sunday. Accommodation is sleeper only, with a total sleeper fare of around ₹450 from Jodhpur to Karachi.
In the other direction the Pakistani train leaves Karachi at about 11pm on Friday, and Indian train 14890 leaves Munabao at 7pm on Saturday, reaching Jodhpur at 11.50pm.
Around Jodhpur
The mainly arid countryside around Jodhpur is dotted with surprising lakes, isolated forts and palaces, and intriguing villages. It’s home to a clutch of fine heritage hotels where you can enjoy the slower pace of rural life.
Southern Villages
A number of traditional villages are strung along and off the Pali road southeast of Jodhpur. Most hotels and guesthouses in Jodhpur offer tours to these villages, often called Bishnoi village safaris. The Bishnoi are a Hindu sect who follow the 500-year-old teachings of Guru Jambheshwar, who emphasised the importance of protecting the environment long before it was popular to do so. Many visitors are surprised by the density – and fearlessness – of wildlife such as blackbuck, bluebulls (nilgai), chinkara gazelles and desert fox around the Bishnoi villages. The Bishnoi hold all animal life sacred. The 1730 sacrifice of 363 villagers to protect khejri trees is commemorated in September at Khejadali village, where there is a memorial to the victims fronted by a small grove of khejri trees.
At Guda Bishnoi, the locals are traditionally engaged in animal husbandry. There’s a small lake (full only after a good monsoon) where migratory birds such as demoiselle cranes, and mammals such as blackbucks and chinkaras, can be seen, particularly at dusk when they come to drink.
The village of Salawas is a centre for weaving beautiful dhurries (rugs), a craft also practised in many other villages. A cooperative of 42 families runs theRoopraj Dhurry Udyog (%0291-2896658; rooprajdurry@sify.com), through which all profits go to the artisans. A 3ft by 5ft dhurrie costs a minimum of ₹2800, a price based on two weavers working several hours a day for a month at ₹50 per day each. Other families are involved in block-printing.
Bishnoi village tours from Jodhpur tend to last four hours and cost around
₹800 per person. Those run by Deepak Dhanraj of Bishnoi Village Safari (%9829126398; www.bishnoivillagesafari.com) receive good feedback, but many other places offer them.
Rohet
Rohet Garh (%02936-268231; www.rohetgarh.com; Rohet Village; s/d ₹8500/9500, ste ₹12,000;
aiWs), in Rohet village, 40km south of Jodhpur on the Pali road, is one of the area’s most appealing heritage hotels. This 350-year-old, lovingly tended manor has masses of character and a tranquil atmosphere, which obviously helped Bruce Chatwin when he wrote The Songlines here, and William Dalrymple when he began City of Djinns in the same room, No 15. Rohet Garh has a gorgeous colonnaded pool, charming green gardens, great food
(lunch/dinner ₹750/900) and lovely, individual rooms. It also possesses a stable of fine Marwari horses and organises rides ranging from two-hour evening trots (₹2000) to six-day countryside treks, sleeping in luxury tents. The quirky Om Bana Temple is a short bus ride from here.
A taxi from Jodhpur will cost around ₹800. There are also frequent buses; once here, turn right out of Rohet’s tiny bus stand, take the first right and keep walking for about 1km.
WORTH A TRIP
THE MOTORBIKE TEMPLE
Om Bana Temple
(Motorbike Temple)
HINDU TEMPLE
One of the strangest temples in all India stands 8km south of Rohet beside the Pali road, near Chotila village. The deity at Om Bana Temple is a garland-decked Enfield Bullet motorcycle, known as Bullet Baba. The story goes that local villager Om Bana died at this spot in the 1980s when his motorbike skidded into a tree. The bike was taken to the localspot     t  e  980s      e
 
s    oto b   e s   dded    to a t ee      e b   e   as ta  e   to t  e  oca
police station, but then mysteriously twice made its own way back to the tree, and travellers along the road started seeing visions of Om Bana – inevitably leading to the machine’s deification.
Any time of day or night people can be seen at the open-air shrine here, simultaneously praying for safe journeys and making offerings of liquor.
Buses from Jodhpur to Rohet should continue on to Om Bana, but check with the driver. Otherwise, you can hop on almost any passing bus from Rohet (₹10).
Osian
The ancient Thar Desert town of Osian, 65km north of Jodhpur, was an important trading centre between the 8th and 12th centuries. Known as Upkeshpur, it was dominated by the Jains, whose wealth left a legacy of exquisitely sculpted, well-preserved temples.
The Mahavira Temple (Indian/foreigner free/₹10, camera/video ₹50/100; h6am-8.30pm)
surrounds an image of the 24th tirthankar, formed from sand and milk. Sachiya Mata Temple (h6am-7.15pm) is an impressive walled complex where both Hindus and Jains worship.
Prakash Bhanu Sharma, a personable Brahmin priest, has an echoing
guesthouse (%02922-274331, 9414440479; s/d without bathroom ₹250/300) geared
towards pilgrims, opposite the Mahavira Temple. Safari Camp Osian
(%9928311435; www.safaricamposian.com; tent s/d incl dinner, breakfast & camel ride ₹7000/9000) is
a fancier, tented camp option.
Gemar Singh (%9460585154; www.hacra.org; per person per day approx ₹1400, minimum 2
people) arranges popular camel safaris, homestays, camping, desert walks and
4WD trips in the deserts around Osian and the Rajput and Bishnoi villages. The cost is around ₹1400 per person per day (minimum two people). Pick up from Osian bus station, or from Jodhpur, can be arranged.
There are frequent buses from Jodhpur to Osian (₹45, 90 minutes). Trains between Jodhpur and Jaisalmer also stop here. A return taxi from Jodhpur costs about ₹1200.
Jaisalmer%02992 / Pop 89,000
The fort of Jaisalmer is a breathtaking sight: a massive sandcastle rising from the sandy plains like a mirage from a bygone era. No place better evokes exotic camel-train trade routes and desert mystery. Ninety-nine bastions encircle the fort’s still-inhabited twisting lanes. Inside are shops swaddled in bright embroideries, a royal palace and numerous businesses looking for your tourist rupee.
Despite the commercialism it’s hard not to be enchanted by this desert citadel. Beneath the ramparts, particularly to the north, the narrow streets of the old city conceal magnificent havelis, all carved from the same golden-honey sandstone as the fort – hence Jaisalmer’s designation as the Golden City.
A city that has come back almost from the dead in the past half-century, Jaisalmer may be remote but it’s certainly not forgotten – indeed it’s one of Rajasthan’s most popular tourist destinations, and few people come here without climbing onto a camel in the surrounding Thar Desert. Competition to get your bum into a camel saddle can be fierce, with some operators adopting unpleasant hard-sell tactics. Generally speaking, though, this is a much more laid-back, hassle-free place to stay than the likes of Jaipur or Jodhpur.
Jaisalmer celebrates its desert culture in January or February each year with the action-packed Desert Festival (hJan/Feb), featuring camel races, camel polo, folk music, snake charmers, turban-tying contests and the famous Mr Desert competition. Many events take place at the Sam Sand Dunes.
History
Jaisalmer was founded way back in 1156 by a leader of the Bhati Rajput clan named Jaisal. The Bhatis, who trace their lineage back to Krishna, ruled right through to Independence in 1947.
The city’s early centuries were tempestuous, partly because its rulers relied on looting for want of other income, but by the 16th century Jaisalmer was prospering from its strategic position on the camel-train routes between India and Central Asia. It eventually established cordial relations with the Mughal empire. In the mid-17th century Maharawal Sabal Singh expanded the Jaisalmer princedom to its greatest extents by annexing areas that now fall within theadministrative districts of Bikaner and Jodhpur.
Under British rule the rise of sea trade (especially through Mumbai) and railways saw Jaisalmer’s importance and population decline. Partition in 1947, with the cutting of trade routes to Pakistan, seemingly sealed the city’s fate. But the 1965 and 1971 wars between India and Pakistan gave Jaisalmer new strategic importance, and since the 1960s the Indira Gandhi Canal to the north has brought revitalising water to the desert.
Today tourism and the area’s many military installations are the pillars of the city’s economy.

FORT
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
Jaisalmer’s unique fort is a living urban centre, with about 3000 people residing within its walls. It’s honeycombed with narrow, winding lanes, lined with houses and temples – along with a large number of handicraft shops, guesthouses and restaurants. You enter the fort from the east, near Gopa Chowk, and pass through four massive gates on the zigzagging route to the upper part. The final gate opens onto the square that forms the fort’s centre, Dashera Chowk.
Founded in 1156 by the Rajput ruler Jaisal and reinforced by subsequent rulers, Jaisalmer Fort was the focus of a number of battles between the Bhatis, the Mughals of Delhi and the Rathores of Jodhpur. In recent years, the fabric of the fort has faced increasing conservation problems due to unrestricted water use caused by high tourist numbers.

 ; Indian/foreigner incl compulsory audio guide ₹50/300, camera/video
₹100/200; h8am-6pm Apr-Oct, 9am-6pm Nov-Mar)
Towering over the fort’s main square, and partly built on top of the Hawa Pol (the fourth fort gate), is the former rulers’ elegant seven-storey palace.
Much of the palace is open to the public – floor upon floor of small rooms provide a fascinating sense of how such buildings were designed for spying on the outside world. The doorways connecting the rooms of the palace are quite low. This isn’t a reflection on the stature of the Rajputs, but was a means of forcing people to adopt a humble, stooped position in case the room they were entering contained the maharawal.
The 1½-hour audio-guide tour, available in six languages, is worthwhile, but you must deposit ₹2000 or your passport, driver’s licence or credit card.
Highlights of the tour include the mirrored and painted Rang Mahal (the bedroom of the 18th-century ruler Mulraj II), a gallery of finely wrought 15th- century sculptures donated to the rulers by the builders of the fort’s temples, andthe spectacular 360-degree views from the rooftop. One room contains an intriguing display of stamps from the former Rajput states. On the eastern wall of the palace is a sculpted pavilion-style balcony. Here drummers raised the alarm when the fort was under siege. You can also see numerous round rocks piled on top of the battlements, ready to be rolled onto advancing enemies.
The last part of the tour moves from the king’s palace (Raja-ka-Mahal) into the queen’s palace (Rani-ka-Mahal), which contains an interesting section on Jaisalmer’s annual Gangaur processions in spring.
Jain Temples
JAIN TEMPLE

GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹30/200, camera ₹50; hChandraprabhu 7am-1pm, other
temples 11am-1pm)
Within the fort walls is a maze-like, interconnecting treasure trove of seven beautiful yellow sandstone Jain temples, dating from the 15th and 16th centuries. Opening times have a habit of changing, so check with the caretakers. The intricate carving rivals that of the marble Jain temples in Ranakpur and Mt Abu, and has an extraordinary quality because of the soft, warm stone. Shoes and all leather items must be removed before entering the temples.
Chandraprabhu is the first temple you come to, and you’ll find the ticket stand here. Dedicated to the eighth tirthankar, whose symbol is the moon, it was built in 1509 and features fine sculpture in the mandapa, whose intensely sculpted pillars form a series of toranas. To the right of Chandraprabhu is the tranquil Rikhabdev temple, with fine sculptures around the walls, protected by glass cabinets, and pillars beautifully sculpted with apsaras and gods.
Behind Chandraprabhu is Parasnath, which you enter through a beautifully carved torana culminating in an image of the Jain tirthankar at its apex. A door to the south leads to small Shitalnath, dedicated to the 10th tirthankar, whose image is composed of eight precious metals. A door in the northern wall leads to the enchanting, dim chamber of Sambhavanth – in the front courtyard, Jain priests grind sandalwood in mortars for devotional use. Steps lead down to the Gyan Bhandar, a fascinating, tiny, underground library founded in 1500, which houses priceless ancient illustrated manuscripts. The remaining two temples, Shantinath and Kunthunath, were built in 1536 and feature plenty of sensualcarving. Note, the restrictive visiting times are for non-Jains. The temples are open all day for worshippers.
Laxminarayan Temple
HINDU TEMPLE

The Hindu Laxminarayan Temple, in the centre of the fort, is simpler than the Jain temples here and has a brightly decorated dome. Devotees offer grain, which is distributed before the temple. The inner sanctum has a repoussé silver architrave around its entrance, and a heavily garlanded image enshrined within.
There’s also a small 16th-century Hindu temple devoted to Surya (

 ), the sun god, inside the fort.
A CASTLE BUILT ON SAND
A decade ago the whole structure of Jaisalmer Fort was in danger of being undermined by water leakage from its antique drainage system. The main problem was material progress, in the form of piped water for the fort’s inhabitants. Three of the ancient bastions had collapsed and parts of the fort palace were leaning at an alarming rate.
Since then, British-based Jaisalmer in Jeopardy (www.jaisalmer-in-jeopardy.org) and several Indian organisations, including the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH; www.intach.org), have raised funds and carried out much-needed conservation works to save the fort. Most important has been the renewal of the fort’s drainage system and repaving of the streets, as well as repair works inside the fort palace.
Things have improved, although some conservationists still believe the fort’s structure is in danger, and calls remain for the fort’s inhabitants, and those who work in the fort, to be forced to leave. The fort’s current population has been established since the 1960s; before then, the fort’s inhabitants numbered in the few hundreds, made up mostly of royal family and their workers, plus monks and priests connected to the fort’s temples. Visitors should be aware of the fort’s fragile nature and conserve resources, especially water, as much as possible. Given that the most recent section of wall collapse took place in 2011, we recommend staying in accommodation outside the fort.
Havelis
Inside the fort but outside it, too (especially in the streets to the north), Jaisalmer is replete with the fairy-tale architecture of havelis – gorgeously carved stonedoorways, jali screens, balconies and turrets. There are some outstanding examples of incredibly fine sandstone havelis built by wealthy merchants and local notables in the 18th to 20th centuries.

The biggest fish in the haveli pond is Patwa-ki-Haveli, which towers over a narrow lane, its intricate stonework like honey-coloured lace. Divided into five sections, it was built between 1800 and 1860 by five Jain brothers who made their fortunes in brocade and jewellery. It’s most impressive from the outside. The first of the five sections is open as the privately owned Kothari’s Patwa-

The left and right wings were the work of two brothers, whose competitive spirits apparently produced this virtuoso work – the two sides are similar, but not identical. Sandstone elephants guard the entrance.

It’s brought alive by the guided tour you’ll get from its founder, local historian and folklorist LN Khatri. We enjoyed the snakes and ladders game that acts as a teaching guide to Hinduism’s spirutal journey. If the door is locked, you’ll find Mr Khatri at his shop, Desert Handicrafts Emporium, nearby on Court Rd.
T Tours The tourist office runs sunset tours to the Sam Sand Dunes (₹200 per person, minimum four people). Add ₹100 if you’d like a short camel ride too.
JAISALMER CAMEL SAFARIS
Trekking around by camel is the most evocative and fun way to sample Thar Desert life. However, don’t expect dune seas – the Thar is mostly arid scrubland sprinkled with villages and wind turbines, with occasional dune areas popping out here and there. You will often come across fields of millet, and children herding flocks of sheep or goats whose neckbells tinkle in the desert silence – a welcome change after the sound of belching camels.
Most trips now include 4WD rides to get you to less frequented areas. The camel riding is then done in two-hour segments: one before lunch, one after. It’s hardly camel trekking, but it is a lot of fun. A cheaper alternative to arranging things in Jaisalmer is to base yourself in the small village of Khuri, 48km southwest, where similar camel rides are available, but you’re already in the desert when you start.
BEFORE YOU GO
Competition between safari organisers is cut-throat and standards vary. Most hotels and guesthouses are very happy to organise a camel safari for you. While many provide a good service, some may cut corners and take you for the kind of ride you didn’t have in mind. A few low-budget hotels in particular exert considerable pressure on guests to take ‘their’ safari. Others specifically claim ‘no safari hassle’.‘their’ safari. Others specifically claim ‘no safari hassle’.
You can also organise a safari directly with one of the several reputable specialist agencies in Jaisalmer. Since these agencies depend exclusively on safari business it’s particularly in their interest to satisfy their clients. It’s a good idea to talk to other travellers and ask two or three operators what they’re offering.
A one-night safari leaving Jaisalmer in the afternoon and returning the next morning, with a night on some dunes, is the minimum you'll need to get a feel for the experience: you’ll probably get 1½ to two hours of riding each day. You can trek for several days or weeks if you wish. The longer you ride, the more you’ll gain an understanding of the desert’s villages, oases, wildlife and people.
The best-known dunes, at Sam (40km west of Jaisalmer), are always crowded in the evening and visiting them is more of a carnival than a back-to-nature experience. The dunes near Khuri are also quite busy at sunset, but quiet the rest of the time. Operators all sell trips now to ‘nontouristy’ and ‘off the beaten track’ areas. Ironically, this has made Khuri quieter again, although Sam still hums with day-tripper activity.
With 4WD transfers included, typical rates are between ₹1100 and ₹1700 per person for an overnight trip (leaving one morning, and returning the next). This should include meals, mineral water and blankets, and sometimes a thin mattress. Check that there will be one camel for each rider. You can pay for greater levels of comfort (eg tents, better food), but always get it all down in writing.
You should get a cheaper rate (₹900 to ₹1500 per person) if you leave Jaisalmer in the afternoon and return the following morning. A quick sunset ride in the dunes at Sam costs around ₹550 per person, including 4WD transfer. At the other end of the scale, you can arrange a 20-day trek to Bikaner. Expect to pay between ₹1000 and ₹2000 per person per day for long, multiday trips, depending on the level of support facilities
(4WDs, camel carts, etc).
WHAT TO TAKE
A wide-brimmed hat, long trousers, long-sleeved shirt, insect repellent, toilet paper, torch, sunscreen, water bottle (with a strap) and some cash (to tip the camel men, if nothing else) are recommended. It can get cold at night, so if you have a sleeping bag, bring it along, even if you’re told that lots of blankets will be supplied. Women should consider wearing a sports bra, as a trotting camel is a bumpy ride. During summer, rain is not unheard of, so come prepared.
WHICH SAFARI?
There are several options, and recommendations here shouldn't be a substitute for doing your own research. Whichever agency you go for, insist that all rubbish is carried back to Jaisalmer.

IN THE DESERT
Camping out at night, huddling around a tiny fire beneath the stars and listening to the camel drivers’ songs is magical.
There’s always a long lunch stop during the hottest part of the day. At resting points the camels are unsaddled and hobbled; they’ll often have a roll in the sand before limping away to graze on nearby shrubs, while the camel drivers brew chai or prepare food. The whole crew rests in the shade of thorn trees.
Take care of your possessions, particularly on the return journey. Any complaints you do have should be reported in Jaisalmer, either to the Superintendent of Police (252233), the tourist office, or the

4 Sleeping While staying in the fort might appear to be Jaisalmer's most atmospheric choice, tourism has helped exert massive pressure on the fort’s infrastructure. As a result, we don't recommend staying inside the fort. Fortunately, there's a wide choice of good places to stay outside the fort.
You’ll get massive discounts between April and August, when Jaisalmer is hellishly hot. Some budget hotels are heavily into high-pressure selling of camel safaris and things can turn sour if you don’t take up their offers: room rates that sound too good to be true almost always are.

Italian-designed and super slick, this is Jaisalmer’s most sophisticated modern hotel and it is beautiful throughout with a desert-meets-contemporary boutique vibe.

Jaisalmer’s infamous lassi shop is a simple, pocket-sized place. The added ingredient is bhang: cannabis buds and leaves mixed into a paste with milk, ghee and spices. It also does a range of bhang-laced cookies. Bhang is legal here, but it doesn’t agree with everyone so if you’re not used to this sort of thing, go easy or avoid it altogether.

The airy open-air dining room at Monica just about squeezes in a fort view, but if you end up at a non-view table, console yourself with the excellent veg and nonveg options. Meat from the tandoor is particularly well-flavoured and succulent, the thalis well-varied, and the salads fresh and clean.

7 Shopping Jaisalmer is famous for its stunning embroidery, bedspreads, mirror-word wall hangings, oil lamps, stonework and antiques. Watch out when purchasing silver items: the metal is sometimes adulterated with bronze.

ARRIVAL IN JAISALMER
Touts work the buses heading to Jaisalmer from Jodhpur, hoping to steer travellers to guesthouses or hotels in Jaisalmer where they will get a commission. Some may even approach you before the bus leaves Jodhpur; others ride part or all of the way from Jodhpur, or board about an hour before Jaisalmer. On arrival in Jaisalmer, buses can be surrounded by touts baying for your attention. Don’t believe anyone who offers to take you ‘anywhere you like’ for just a few rupees, and do take with a fistful of salt any claims that the hotel you want is ‘full’, ‘closed’ or ‘no good any more.’ Many hotels will offer pick- ups from the bus or train station.
Be very wary of offers of rooms for ₹100 or similar absurd rates. Places offering such prices are almost certainly in the camelsafari hard-sell game and their objective is to get you out of the room and onto a camel as fast as possible. If you don’t take up their safari offers, the room price may suddenly increase or you might be told there isn’t a room available any more.
Touts are less prevalent on the trains, but the same clamour for your custom ensues outside the station once you have arrived.
8 Getting There & Away

Around Jaisalmer
Sam Sand Dunes
Sam Sand Dunes
(admission vehicle/camel ₹50/80)
OUTDOORS
The silky Sam Sand Dunes, 41km west of Jaisalmer along a good sealed road (maintained by the Indian army), are one of the most popular excursions from the city. The band of dunes is about 2km long and is undeniably one of the most picturesque in the region. Some camel safaris camp here, but many more people just roll in for sunset, to be chased across the sands by dressed-up dancing children and tenacious camel owners offering short rides. Plenty more people stay overnight in one of the couple of dozen tent resorts near the dunes.
All in all the place acquires something of a carnival atmosphere from late afternoon till the next morning, making it somewhere to avoid if you’re after a solitary desert sunset experience.
If you’re organising your own camel ride on the spot, expect to pay ₹200 to ₹300 for a one-hour sunset ride, but beware the tricks of some camel men, such as demanding more money en route.
Khuri
%03014
The village of Khuri, 48km southwest of Jaisalmer, has quite extensive dune areas attracting their share of sunset visitors, and a lot of mostly smallish ‘resorts’ offering the same sort of overnight packages as those at Sam. It also has a number of low-key guesthouses where you can stay in tranquility in atraditional-style hut with clay-and-dung walls and thatched roof, and venture out on interesting camel trips in the relatively remote and empty surrounding area. Khuri is within the Desert National Park, which stretches over 3162 sq km southwest of Jaisalmer to protect part of the Thar ecosystem, including wildlife such as the desert fox, desert cat, chinkara gazelle, nilgai or bluebull (a large antelope), and some unusual bird life including the endangered great Indian bustard.
Be aware that the commission system is entrenched in Khuri’s larger accommodation options. If you just want a quick camel ride on the sand dunes, expect to pay around ₹150 per person.
4 Sleeping
o Badal House
(%8107339097; r or hut per person incl full board ₹450)
HOMESTAY
Here you can stay in a family compound in the centre of the village with a few spotlessly clean, mud-walled, thatch-roofed huts and equally spotless rooms (one with its own squat toilet), and enjoy good home cooking. Former camel driver Badal Singh is a charming, gentle man who charges ₹500 for a camel safari with a night on the dunes. He doesn’t pay commission so don’t let touts warn you away.
8 Getting There & Away You can catch local buses from Jaisalmer to Khuri (₹32, one hour) from a road just off Gadi Sagar Rd. Walking from Jaisalmer Fort towards the train station, take the second right after the tourist office, then wait by the tree on the left, with the small shrine beside it. Buses pass here at around 10am, 11.30am, 3.30pm and 4pm.
Return buses from Khuri to Jaisalmer leave roughly at 8am, 9am, 10.30am, 11.30am and 2.30pm.
Bikaner%0151 / Pop 647,800
Bikaner is a vibrant, dust-swirling desert town with a fabulous fort and an energising outpost feel. It’s less dominated by tourism than many other Rajasthan cities, though it has plenty of hotels and a busy camelsafari scene, which attracts travellers looking to avoid the Jaisalmer hustle.
Around the full moon in January or very late December, Bikaner celebrates its three day Camel Festival, with one day of events at the Karni Singh Stadium and two days out at Ladera, 45km northeast of the city.
History The city was founded in 1488 by Rao Bika, a son of Rao Jodha, Jodhpur’s founder, though the two Rathore ruling houses later had a serious falling out over who had the right to keep the family heirlooms. Bikaner grew quickly as a staging post on the great caravan trade routes from the late 16th century onwards, and flourished under a friendly relationship with the Mughals, but declined as the Mughals did in the 18th century. By the 19th century the area was markedly backward, but managed to turn its fortunes around by hiring out camels to the British during the First Anglo-Afghan War. In 1886 it was the first desert princely state to install electricity.Bikaner1 Sights

This most impressive fort was constructed between 1589 and 1593 by Raja Rai Singh, ruler of Bikaner and a general in the army of the Mughal emperor Akbar.
You enter through the Karan Prole (

 ) gate on the east side
and pass through three more gates before the ticket office for the palace museum. An audio guide (requiring an identity document as a deposit), is available in English, French, German and Hindi, and is very informative.
Old City
AREA 
The old city still has a medieval feel despite the motorbikes and autorickshaws. This labyrinth of narrow, winding streets conceals a number of fine old havelis, and a couple of notable Jain temples just inside the southern wall, 1.5km southwest of Bikaner Junction train station. It makes for an interesting wander – we guarantee you’ll get lost at least once. The old city is encircled by a 7km- long, 18th-century wall with five entrance gates, the main entrance being the triple-arched Kothe Gate.
Bhandasar Temple
JAIN TEMPLE
( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h5am-1pm & 5.30-11.30pm)
Of Bikaner’s two Jain temples, Bhandasar is particularly beautiful, with yellow- stone carving and dizzyingly vibrant paintings. The interior of the temple is stunning. The pillars bear floral arabesques and depictions of the lives of the 24 tirthankars. It’s said that 40,000kg of ghee was used instead of water in the mortar, which locals insist seeps through the floor on hot days. The priest may ask for a donation for entry, although a trust pays for the temple upkeep.
On the 1st floor of the three-storey temple are beautiful miniatures of the sentries of the gods. There are fine views over the city from the 3rd floor, with the desert stretching to the west.
The temple is dedicated to the fifth tirthankar, Sumtinath, and was commissioned in 1468 by a wealthy Jain merchant, Bhandasa Oswal. It was completed after his death in 1514.
Lakshminath Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h5am-1pm & 7.30-11.30pm)
The splendid Hindu Lakshminath Temple, behind Bhandasar Temple, was built during the reign of Rao Lunkaran between 1505 and 1526. Lakshminath was the patron god of the rulers of Bikaner, and during major religious festivals a royal procession headed by the maharaja pays homage here. The elaborate edifice was maintained with tributes received from five villages and several shops, which were granted to the temple by Maharaja Ganga Singh. Photography is prohibited here.BIKANER SAFARIS
Bikaner offers an excellent alternative to the Jaisalmer camel safari scene. There are fewer people running safaris here, so the hassle factor is quite low. Camel trips tend to be in the areas east and south of the city and focus on the isolated desert villages of the Jat, Bishnoi, Meghwal and Rajput peoples. Interesting wildlife can be spotted here, such as bluebull antelopes (nilgai), chinkara gazelles, desert foxes, spiny-tailed lizards and plenty of birds including (from September to March) the demoiselle crane.
Three days and two nights is a common camelsafari duration, but half-day, one-day and short overnight trips are all also possible. If you’re after a serious trip, Jaisalmer is a two-week trek away. The best months to head into the desert are October to February. Avoid mid-April to mid-July, when it’s searingly hot.
Typical costs are ₹1400 to ₹2000 per person per day including overnight camping, with tents, mattresses, blankets, meals, mineral water, one camel per person, a camel cart to carry gear (and sometimes tired riders), and a guide, in addition to the camel men.
Many trips start at Raisar, about 8km east of Bikaner, or Deshnok, 30km south. Travelling to the starting point by bus rather than 4WD is one way of cutting costs.
The standout operator in terms of quality, reliability and transparency is Vijay Singh Rathore, aka Camel Man (%2231244, 9829217331; www.camelman.com; Vijay Guest House, Jaipur Rd; half-/full-/multiday trip per person per day from ₹700/1000/1200, one day, one night per person ₹1600), who operates from Vijay Guest House. Also popular and long-established is Vino Desert Safari (%2270445, 9414139245; www.vinodesertsafari.com; Vino Paying Guest House; one day, one night per person ₹1800, multiday trek per person ₹1500-2000) run by Vinod Bhojak, of Vino Paying Guest House.

This safari focuses on desert animals and birds including the enormous cinereous vulture, with its 3m wingspan, which visits the area in numbers from November to March.
4 Sleeping Hotels and guesthouses are scattered all around town. If you’re arriving by train in the early morning, check whether you’ll have to pay extra for occupying the room before noon.

Evergreen is a neat and clean restaurant whose delicious air conditioning hits you the moment you walk through the door. Despite the Egyptian heiroglyphic wallpaper, the cuisine leans strongly towards South India, with a few classics like paneer tikka and malai kofta. Diners sometimes receive their dishes in sequence rather than all together, but the taste is worth the wait.

There’s a private bus stand ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) outside the south wall of
Junagarh with similar services (albeit slightly more expensive and less frequent) to the government-run services departing from the main bus stand, which is 2km directly north of the fort. An autorickshaw will cost around ₹20.
Services from the main bus stand include the following.
A Ajmer (₹206, six hours, half-hourly until 6pm) A Delhi (₹352, 11 hours, at least four daily) Departs early morning.
A Deshnok (₹26, one hour, half-hourly until 5.30pm) A Fatehpur (₹136, 3½ hours, half-hourly until 5.45pm) A Jaipur (₹255, seven hours, hourly until 5.45pm) A Jaisalmer (₹263, 7½ hours, 12pm) A Jhunjhunu (₹173, five hours, 7.30am, 8.30am, and 6.30pm) A Jodhpur (₹191, five hours, half-hourly until
4.30pm) A Pokaran (₹176, five hours, hourly until 2.15pm) For Jaisalmer, it'ssometimes faster to head to Pokaran (which has more departures) and change there.
TRAIN
The main train station is Bikaner Junction, which has a computerised
reservations office ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h8am-10pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun) in a separate
building just east of the main station building. The foreigner's window is 2931. A couple of other useful services depart from Lalgarh station in the north of the city (₹50 in an autorickshaw).
For Jaisalmer, an evening train with reserved ticketing runs only on Tuesday (sleeper/3AC ₹240/600, five hours, 6.30pm) from Bikaner Junction. On all other days there is the 22480 Bikaner-Jaisalmer Express (2nd class ₹135, five hours, 10.55pm), with unreservable seats. Turn up no less than 30 minutes before departure.
Five daily trains go to Jodhpur (five hours, 12.45am, 6.30am, 9.30am, 11am and 4pm).
Four daily trains go to Delhi (Delhi Sarai Rohilla; 9.15am, 5pm, 7.45pm and 10.20pm). The trip takes eight to 14 hours depending on the departure: the 9.15am and 10.20pm services are the fastest.
Five daily trains go to Jaipur (6½ hours, 5.20am, 6am, 5.15pm 6.45pm and 11.05pm).
There are no direct trains to Ajmer for Pushkar.
8 Getting Around An autorickshaw from the train station to Junagarh palace should cost ₹40, but you’ll probably be asked for more.DON'T MISS
THE TEMPLE OF RATS
Karni Mata Temple
(camera/video ₹20/50; h4am-10pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
The extraordinary Karni Mata Temple at Deshnok, 30km south of Bikaner, is one of India’s weirder attractions. Its resident mass of holy rodents is not for the squeamish, but most visitors to Bikaner brave the potential for ankle-nipping and put a half-day trip here on their itinerary. Frequent buses leave from Bikaner’s main bus stand. A return autorickshaw from Bikaner with a one-hour wait costs ₹400.
Karni Mata lived in the 14th century and performed many miracles during her lifetime. When her youngest son, Lakhan, drowned, she ordered Yama (the god of death) to bring him back to life. Yama said he was unable to do so, but that Karni Mata, as an incarnation of Durga, could restore Lakhan’s life. This she did, decreeing that members of her family would no longer die but would be reincarnated as kabas (rats). Around 600 families in Deshnok claim to be descendants of Karni Mata and that they will be reincarnated as kabas.
The temple isn’t, in fact, swarming with rats, but there are a lot of them here, especially in nooks and crannies and in areas where priests and pilgrims leave food for them. And yes, you do have to take your shoes off to enter the temple: it’s considered highly auspicious to have a kaba run across your feet – you may be graced in this manner whether you want it or not.
You can find food and drinks for yourself at the numerous snack stalls outside.

The British Army had a camel corps drawn from Bikaner during WWI. Guides are available for ₹50-plus. The on-site Camel Milk Parlouroffers samples to try, as well as lassis. Camel-grazing time is 3pm to 6pm and is the best time to come. The round trip, including a half-hour wait at the camel farm, is around ₹150/₹300 for an autorickshaw/taxi.Haryana & Punjab

Haryana & Punjab
Why Go?The neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab were carved from the Indian half of Punjab in the aftermath of Partition. Since then, Punjab has gone from strength to strength as the homeland of India’s fabulously welcoming Sikh community, while Haryana has emerged as a dynamic hub for business and industry.
Studded with gleaming gurdwaras (Sikh temples) – including the unmissable Golden Temple in Amritsar – Punjab has become a popular stop on the traveller circuit. Haryana is more of a touristic mystery, best known for its modernist capital, Chandigarh. The hinterland around these two hubs is dotted with fascinating, rarely visited historic towns that tell a story of battling empires and playboy maharajas, and some of India’s most alluring abandoned forts hide among their dusty bazaars.
Punjab and Haryana are united by their love of food. This is the region that gave the world tandoori chicken, tadka dhal (fried yellow lentils) and butter chicken; the prototype for chicken tikka masala. Enjoy the feast.
When to Go
A Mar Three days of Sikh celebrations for Holla Mohalla at Anandpur Sahib. A Apr Punjab’s largest festival, Baisakhi, marks the Sikh New Year and the founding of the Khalsa.A Oct Diwali means lights, candles and fireworks everywhere; it’s particularly magical at the Golden Temple.

%0172 / Pop 1.1 million
Chandigarh is a place to see India as it would like to be seen – prosperous, comfortable and cosmopolitan. Officially a Union Territory controlled by the central government, Chandigarh is the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana. It is also the first planned city of independent India.
When the Swiss architect Le Corbusier was commissioned in 1950, he conceived a people-oriented city of sweeping boulevards, lakes and gardens and grand civic buildings, executed in his favourite material, reinforced concrete. So Chandigarh came into being; turn the clocks forward 60 years and the parks, monuments and civic squares are still here, albeit aged somewhat.
Each sector of the city is self-contained and pedestrian-friendly. Most visitors concentrate their attention on Sector 17 (for shops and restaurants) and Sector 22 (for hotels).Chandigarh

Nek Chand Rock Garden is unique: the surreal fantasy of a local transport official who, starting in 1957, spent almost 20 years personally creating more than 2000 sculptures using stones, debris and other discarded junk that was left over from the 50-odd villages that were destroyed in order to build the city of Chandigarh. Now, entering this fantastical, 10-hectare sculpture garden is like falling down a rabbit hole into the labyrinthine interior of one man’s imagination.
Materials used in the construction of the garden range from concrete and steel drums to light switches, broken bathroom sinks and bicycle frames. Highlights include a legion of dancing girls made from broken glass bangles and a graceful arcade of towering arches with dangling rope swings. Ned Chand worked at night to begin with, to keep his eccentric masterpiece from the prying eyes of the

 ), which are shared by the states of
Punjab and Haryana. All three are classic pieces of 1950s architecture from the proto-brutalist school, with bold geometric lines and vast sweeps of moulded concrete. To visit the complex, you must first register, with your passport, at the
High Court Tourist Office (

reservation office (

 ; %2720242; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm
Sun) on the 1st floor of ISBT-17. There’s no prepaid autorickshaw fee from the centre to the train station, but expect to pay around ₹100.
Several fast trains go to New Delhi daily: the quickest and slickest is the twice-daily Kalka Shatabdi (AC chair/1AC ₹595/1190, 3½ hours), which leaves at 6.53am and 6.23pm. To get to Delhi more cheaply, buy an unreserved ‘general’ ticket (₹110 to ₹145) when you turn up at the station and then just pile into the 2nd-class carriage of the next available train.
More than half a dozen trains go to Kalka (2nd-class seat/sleeper ₹45/140, 35 minutes), from where narrow-gauge trains rattle up through the hills to Shimla.
Two daily trains go to Amritsar (2nd class/AC chair ₹120/430, 4½ hours), at 7am and 5.10pm.
8 Getting Around Bicycles (₹100 per eight hours; ₹500 refundable deposit) are available at Sukhna Lake.
Expect to pay ₹30 for a short hop on a cycle-rickshaw. Hiring one for half a day (up to four hours), to take in sights such as Nek Chand Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake, will cost around ₹300.
Numerous local buses, including 203 and 22, link ISBT-17 with the train station (₹10).
There’s a prepaid autorickshaw stand ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) opposite ISBT-17, but it only does fares within the city centre, such as to ISBT-43 (₹54). For places further afield, such as the train station (about ₹80) or the airport (about ₹150), you’ll have to negotiate with the driver.
RK Taxi Stand (

Yadavindra Gardens
These beautifully restored 17th-century Mughal-era walled gardens (Pinjore
Gardens; %01733-230759; admission ₹20; h7am-10pm), on the edge of the small town of
Pinjore, are built on seven levels with water features and serene views of the Shivalik Hills.
Within the grounds there’s a restaurant ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Pinjore Gardens; mains
₹70-200; h10am-7pm) in the Rang Mahal pavilion, which also has a bar. Come in December for regional delicacies and cultural performances as part of the Pinjore festival.
Should you fancy an overnight stay, there are pleasant rooms with Mughal- style flourishes and views of the gardens at the Budgerigar Motel (

 ; %01733-231877; pinjore@hry.nic.in; d ₹2150-3000; a). Its main entrance is
just outside the walls, to the right as you face the entrance to the gardens, but it can also be accessed from inside the gardens, through the restaurant.
Nearby is the Bhima Devi Museum (h10am-5pm), made up of a collection of small buildings in the grounds of the scattered ruins of the ornate, 10th- century Bhima Devi Temple, which was torn down when the gardens were originally constructed. To get here, turn left as you exit the gardens and walk past the new water park.
Frequent buses leave from Chandigarh’s ISBT-43 to Pinjore (₹30, one hour). The gardens are on your left as you drive into the town. Less frequent services depart from ISBT-17.Morni Hills
Perched at 1220m, Haryana’s only hill station is set amid monkey-filled forests on a spur running west from the Shivalik Hills. Here you’ll find a handful of rustic resorts, the village of Morni and, 7km downhill from the village, Tikka Tal, a pair of two pretty lakes with boats for rent (from ₹200).
With a pleasant location on the shore of the second lake, Tikkar Taal
Complex ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %01733-250166; Tikka Tal; dm non-AC/AC ₹215/430, d ₹1611) has
clean, comfortable dormitories and rooms with private bathrooms and views of the lake. There’s a restaurant with terraced seating and gardens leading down to the lake. There’s nothing much to do here, but it’s a wonderfully peaceful place to stay if you want to escape the freneticism for a day or two.
There are daily buses to Morni (₹30, two hours) from Chandigarh’s ISBT Panchkulla bus station. From Morni Village, there are three minibuses to Tikka Tal (₹10), at 6.30am, 7.30am and 3.30pm. They return from outside Tikkar Taal Complex at 7.30am, 8.30am and 4.15pm. The 4.15pm connects with the last bus back to Chandigarh, which leaves Morni Village at 5pm.
Private cars from Morni Village to Tikka Tal cost a whopping ₹700 return. Alternatively, it’s a lovely two-hour, 7km downhill walk: walk back up the road towards Chandigarh, then turn left as the road bears sharp right (after less than 1km). Hitching is also possible.

Patiala
%0175 / Pop 405,200
Punjab’s best-kept secret, Patiala was once the capital of an independent Sikh state, ruled by an extravagant family of maharajas. As the Mughal empire declined, the rulers of Patiala curried favour with the British and filled their citywith lavish palaces and follies. Family fortunes have declined and the grand monuments are crumbling, but the old city, ringed by 10 historic gates, is swooningly atmospheric. In January/February, the skies above Patiala burst into life for the Basant kite festival.

The ancestral home of the maharajas of Patiala, this richly ornamented but fading 18th-century fort is an Arabian Nights fantasy of soaring buttresses and latticed balconies. You can’t enter the interior of the fort, but you are allowed to walk between the hugely impressive inner and outer walls, surrounded by crumbling masonry and flocks of emerald-green parakeets.
Just inside the main entrance, to your right, the 1859 Durbar Hall (admission ₹10) has a wonderful collection of royal weaponry, outrageous chandeliers and other treasures rescued from the decaying palaces. It’s open from 10.15am to 4.45pm, every day except Monday. The grounds of the fort itself are always open.
Other Sights
A self-guided walking tour will take you from the fort to various other historic sights. Turn right out of the fort, then right again, and follow the road south to the monumental gateway by the Shahi Samadhan, the three-storey tomb of Maharaja Aala Singh Samad (d 1822). You can climb to the top.
Continue along the same road and bear left by the Samania Gate to reach Mohindra College Rd and the twin towers of the Mohindra College, a former palace converted into a private school.

Of all the ruined forts in Punjab, Bathinda’s Govindgarh is the mightiest and most impressive. It’s also one of the oldest, dating way back to the 7th century, although rebuilt in its current red-brick form during the 12th century. It’s an enormous structure, located smack bang in the middle of the city, and an unexpected highlight of a visit to this region. The fort’s 36m-tall, 6m-thick walls tower over the old city bazaars and, best of all, it can be explored.
The fort contains two gurdwaras so, unlike other ancient forts in the region, it is open to the public; as well as visiting the gurdwaras themselves, you can wander the lawned gardens within the walls and even climb up on top in one spot for magnificent views of the city. Don’t miss walking around the outside of the fort to the western face, where the immense walls are at their most impressive, towering above dhobi-wallahs (clothes washers) and cotton-loomers working on the dusty streets below.

Faridkot was the capital of another vanished Sikh state. Today peacocks stalk the faded battlements of the once mighty Qila Mubarak, a fort protected by 15m- high walls, which was the ancestral home of the maharajas of Faridkot. Nearby the Tilla Baba Farid Ji is a recent rebuild of an age-old gurdwara, dedicated to the 13th-century Sufi poet Baba Sheikh Farid, whose poems were an inspiration for Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism. Also in town is the Raj Mahal, the current residence of the former royal family, who moved here from the fort in the 1880s, and the beautiful, 30m-tall, French-designed Victoria Memorial Clock Tower (c 1902), as well as the attractive, pastel-green Memorial Library.

KAPURTHALA
Once the capital of a wealthy independent state, Kapurthala is an unusual place to explore. The resident maharaja, Jagatjit Singh, was a travel junkie; he married Spanish flamenco dancer Anita Delgado and constructed numerous buildings inspired by his travels. The Jagatjit Palace (now the exclusive Sainik School) was modelled on Versailles, while the Moorish Mosque copies the Grand Mosque in Marrakesh (Morocco). Other sights of note include the British-style Jagatjit Club and Jubilee Hall, the Shalimar Gardens (containing the cenotaphs of the Kapurthala dynasty) and the handsome Indo- Saracenic court house.
Pick up a street map of Kapurthala in the tourist office in Amritsar. Otherwise, follow this leisurely one-to two-hour walking tour: Turn left out of the bus station, then take the first right after Hotel Royal. Turn left at the end to see Jagatjit Club (on your left) and Jagatjit Palace (at the end on your right). Just before Jagatjit Palace, turn right down a tree-shaded lane and bear right past a 150-year-old royal guesthouse, then left past the derelict Gol Kothi (a former residence of the maharaja) and continue straight on to the striking Jubilee Hall. Turn right here, then left at the end of the road (passing thebeautiful whitewashed state gurdwara on your right en route), then take a diagonal left turn to reach the Moorish Mosque, a still-active mosque and one of the few historic buildings you can actually enter. Walk back the way you came; up the diagonal road, and right at the end, to pass the court house on your left. Turn left at the end, then first right to take you back to the town’s main road. Turn left here for Shalimar Gardens, or right to get back to the bus stand.
Decent rooms and very tasty meals are available at Hotel Royal (%01822-505110; Jallandhar Rd; r ₹850-1350; a), 200m from the bus stand.
To get to Amritsar, you need to take a bus to Subhanpur (₹10, 30 minutes) then change for Amritsar (₹50, 1½ hours). There are four morning buses to Faridkot (₹100) at 6am, 7am, 8.40am and 10.20am.
Amritsar
%0183 / Pop 1.13 million
Founded in 1577 by the fourth Sikh guru, Ram Das, Amritsar is home to Sikhism’s holiest shrine, the spectacular Golden Temple, one of India’s most serene and humbling sights. The same cannot be said for the hyperactive streets surrounding the temple.
Amritsar is divided in two by a tangle of railway lines. The old city, containing the Golden Temple and other historic sights and bound by 12 medieval gates, is southeast of the railway lines. This is a fascinating area to explore, with a capillary network of narrow bazaars that seems to float between the centuries.
To the north of the railway lines, ‘modern’ Amritsar has grown up in haphazard fashion around a scattering of colonial-era boulevards. Gleaming malls and upmarket hotels stand testament to the prosperity of the city, but the hectic traffic makes this area hard to love at street level. Crossing between the old and new cities is best done by cycle-rickshaw, but once you’re in the old city, walking is often the quickest way to get around.
Taxis taking you to the Golden Temple area will often drop you at Furwara Chowk from where you can walk the last few hundred metres.Amritsar

SIKH TEMPLE

 ; %information office 2553954; h24hr, information office 8am-7pm)
The legendary Golden Temple is actually just a small part of this huge gurdwara complex, known to Sikhs as Harmandir Sahib (or Darbar Sahib).
Spiritually, the focus of attention is the tank that surrounds the gleaming
central shrine – the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar; 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), from
which Amritsar takes its name, excavated by the fourth guru Ram Das in 1577. Ringed by a marble walkway, the tank is said to have healing powers, and pilgrims come from across the world to bathe in the sacred waters.
Floating at the end of a long causeway, the Golden Temple itself is a mesmerising blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles, with an elegant marble lower level adorned with flower and animal motifs in pietra dura work (as seen on the Taj Mahal). Above this rises a shimmering second level, encased in intricately engraved gold panels, and topped by a dome gilded with 750kg of gold. In the gleaming inner sanctum (photography prohibited), priests and musicians keep up a continuous chant from the Guru Granth Sahib (the Sikh
h l  b   k)   dd           h    l    d
hf                  hholy book), adding to the already intense atmosphere. After paying their respects, pilgrims retreat to the intricately painted gallery on the second level to contemplate.
The Guru Granth Sahib is installed in the temple every morning and returned
at night to the Akal Takhat (Timeless Throne; 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), the temporal
seat of the Khalsa brotherhood. The ceremony takes place at 5am and 9.40pm in winter, and 4am and 10.30pm in summer. Inside the Akal Takhat, you can view a collection of sacred Sikh weapons. The building was heavily damaged when it was stormed by the Indian army during Operation Blue Star in 1984; it was repaired by the government but Sikhs refused to use the tainted building and rebuilt the tower from scratch.
More shrines and monuments are dotted around the edge of the compound.
Inside the main entrance clock tower, the Sikh Museum (

h7am-7pm summer, 8am-6pm winter) shows the persecution suffered by the Sikhs at the hands of Mughals, the British and Indira Gandhi. At the southeast end of the
tank is the Ramgarhia Bunga (

 ), a protective fortress
topped by two Islamic-style minarets; inside is a stone slab once used for Mughal coronations, seized from Delhi by Ranjit Singh in 1783.

SIKH TEMPLE

Just outside the compound is the octagonal Baba Atal Tower, constructed in 1784 to commemorate Atal Rai, the son of sixth Sikh guru Har Gobind, who according to legend revived a playmate from the dead, then gave his own life as penance for interfering in god’s designs. The nine storeys each represent one year of Atal’s short life.

At the southeast end of the compound is the Guru-Ka-Langar, an enormous dining room where an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 pilgrims a day come to eat after praying at the Golden Temple. There’s no charge to eat here, but a donation is appropriate and help with the staggering pile of washing up is always appreciated  Catering to everyone from paupers to millionaires it's a humblingappreciated.

Reached through a gatehouse on the road to the Golden Temple, this poignant park commemorates the 1500 Indians killed or wounded when a British officer ordered his soldiers to shoot on unarmed protesters in 1919. Some of the bullet holes are still visible in the walls, as is the well into which hundreds desperately leapt to avoid the bullets. There’s an eternal (24-hour) flame of remembrance, an exhibition telling the stories of victims, and a Martyrs’ Gallery, with portraits of Independence heroes.

 ; Gobindgarh Rd; hdawn-dusk)
Dedicated to the goddess Durga, this 16th-century temple is a Hindu version of the Golden Temple. Surrounded by a holy water tank, it’s often called the Silver Temple because of its exquisitely engraved silver doors. Soothing bhajans (devotional songs) are sung here just after the temple opens and just before it closes.
Mata Temple

 ; Rani-ka-Bagh, Model Town; hdawn-dusk)
Credited with fertility-improving powers, this fascinating, labyrinthine Hindu temple commemorates the bespectacled 20th-century female saint Lal Devi. From the main hall, a narrow series of stairways and passages winds past mirrored mosaics, fairground-style carvings and untold deity statues to a semi- submerged mock-up of the Vasihno Devi cave temple.
Walking west along GT Rd, turn right after the train station, up Albert Rd, then take the first left and the temple will be to your left at the end of the lane.

This vast, sprawling castle of a college, on your right as you head west along GT Rd, was founded in 1890 to educate the cream of Punjabi society; it’s a glorious example of the Indo-Saracenic style.
THE JALLIANWALA BAGH MASSACRE
Following the introduction of the Rowlatt Act 1919, which gave British authorities the power to imprison Indians suspected of sedition without trial, Amritsar became a focal point for the Independence movement. After a series of hartals (general strikes) in which many protesters and three British bank managers were killed, Brigadier General Reginald Dyer was called upon to return order to the city.
On 13 April 1919 (Baisakhi Day), over 5000 Indian protesters gathered in Jallianwala Bagh, an open courtyard surrounded by high walls. Under orders to make an example of the protesters, Dyer arrived with 150 troops and ordered his soldiers to open fire. When the barrage of bullets ceased, nearly 400 protesters were dead, according to the British authorities (although Indian National Congress placed the figure at more than 1000), and around 1500 were wounded, including many women and children.
Dyer’s action was supported by the British establishment but described as ‘monstrous’ by Winston Churchill, and as ‘a savage and inappropriate folly’ by Sir Edwin Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, while the Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore renounced his knighthood in protest of the massacre. The incident galvanised Indian nationalism – Gandhi responded with a program of civil disobedience, announcing that ‘cooperation in any shape or form with this satanic government is sinful’.
Reginald Dyer died in retirement in England in 1927; Sir Michael O’Dwyer, governor of the Punjab at the time of the massacre, was assassinated by the Sikh revolutionary Udham Singh in London in 1940. Richard Attenborough’s acclaimed film Gandhi (1982) dramatically re-enacts the events at Jallianwala Bagh.
T ToursThe Grand Hotel runs day tours of the main sights (₹350 per hour) and evening tours (₹650 per person, starting at 3pm) to the Attari–Wagah border-closing ceremony, Mata Temple and Golden Temple.
The tourist office runs an interesting two-hour Heritage Walk
(Indian/foreigner ₹25/75), covering the old-city bazaars. It starts from the Town Hall at 8am and 5pm daily (9am and 4pm December to February) and finishes outside the Golden Temple. Just turn up at the Town Hall 10 minutes before the start.
GOLDEN TEMPLE ETIQUETTE
Before entering the compound, remove your shoes and socks (there are chappal (sandal) stands at the entrances), wash your feet in the shallow foot baths and cover your head; scarves can be borrowed (no charge) or hawkers sell souvenir scarves for
₹10. Tobacco and alcohol are strictly prohibited. If you want to sit beside the tank, sit cross-legged and do not dangle your feet in the water. Photography is permitted from the walkway surrounding the pool, but not inside the Golden Temple itself.

Inexpensive rooms are available in the niwas (pilgrim hostels) at the southeast end of the Golden Temple compound. Foreigners are generally accommodated in the dorm at Sri Guru Ram Das Niwas, or at rooms in other buildings – check in at the Guru Arjan Dev Niwas to see what is available.
Staying here is a fascinating experience but rooms and dorms are basic, with shared bathrooms, and there’s a three-day maximum stay. Each person gets use of a locker in the dorms, but you need your own padlock.

Founded by the much-missed Mrs Bhandari (1906–2007), this friendly guesthouse is set in spacious grounds in the Amritsar cantonment, about 2km from the centre. The large rooms have a hint of colonial-era bungalow about them, and the welcome is warm. The well-kept gardens are vast, and includeswings, see-saws, plenty of seating and a small swimming pool, making this an excellent choice for families, while budget travellers can camp here if they bring their own camping equipment.

DON'T MISS
BATTLE OF POMP & CEREMONY
Every afternoon, just before sunset, members of the Indian and Pakistani military meet at the border post between Attari and Wagah to engage in a 30-minute display of military showmanship that verges on pure theatre. Officially, the purpose of the ceremony is to lower the national flag and formally close the border for the night, but what actually occurs is a bizarre mix of formal marching, flag-folding, chest beating, forceful stomping and almost comical high-stepping, as the two sides try to out-do each other in pomp and circumstance. The oiled moustaches and over-the-top dress uniforms (with fan-like flourishes atop each turban) only add to the theatrical mood.
While the participants treat the ceremony with absolute seriousness, the crowds who gather to watch from the grandstands on either side of the border come for the carnival mood. During the build-up to the ceremony, spontaneous anthem chanting, rapturous
d     f       l              d B  ll         d   t  l   d      i     i   th     t     t       d    i            Throunds of applause and Bollywood-style dancing in the street are de rigueur. Then a roar goes up from the crowd as the first soldier from each side marches furiously towards the border, to begin the first round of who-can-high-step-the-highest. It’s all highly nationalistic, but considering the tense relations between the two countries, remarkably good-natured.
The ceremony starts at around 4.15pm in winter and about 5.15pm in summer. Not everyone gets in, though, so arrive at least one hour before the ceremony begins. It’s a mad scrum at the main entrance gate (women must queue on the right; men on the left) as people are let through in sudden bursts, but once you’re through, things calm down, and you are channelled into the appropriate stands (foreign tourists are allowed to sit in the second-best seats, just behind the VIPs) – bring your passport.
Taxis and private buses from Amritsar drop you off by the customs post, a few hundred metres before the entrance gate to the ceremony area. Cameras are permitted but bags, large and small, are banned; lockers (₹50) are available beside the entrance gate.
Most people arrange a taxi with their hotel in Amritsar (around ₹600), but you can also charter a taxi (₹1200), or take a shared taxi from the southeast gate of the Golden Temple (₹120 per person; just hang out around the prepaid taxi booth sometime before 3pm and drivers will find you). Buses to Attari (₹30, one hour) are the cheapest option but leave you with a ₹10 shared auto ride to the customs post – although some local buses (₹35) return to Amritsar afterwards, departing directly from the customs post.
It should be noted that the tragic suicide bombing in November 2014, which claimed the lives of 60 people just outside the entrance to the ceremony on the Pakistan side of the border, is thought to have nothing to do with relations between India and Pakistan. Instead, it is believed to be a response from militant groups to Pakistan’s military operations in northwest Pakistan.

 ), near the train station. Evening air-con buses
run to Delhi (₹800, 10 hours), Chandigarh (₹600, four hours) and Jaipur (seat/sleeper ₹700/900, 16 hours), while non-AC ones run to Jammu (₹250, six hours).
The main Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT; 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; GT Rd) is about
2km north of the Golden Temple, near Mahan Singh Gate. There’s at least one daily bus to Chamba (₹270, six hours), Dharamsala (₹225, seven hours) and Manali (₹550, 12 hours). Frequent buses serve: A Attari ₹30, one hour

TRAIN
Apart from the train station, there’s a less busy train reservation office (

 ; h8am-8pm, to 2pm Sun) at the Golden Temple.
The fastest train to Delhi is the Amritsar Shatabdi (AC chair/1AC ₹865/1690, six hours, two daily). Trains leave Amritsar at 5am and 4.50pm; from New Delhi train station, they leave at 7.20am and 4.30pm. There are around a dozen other daily trains to Delhi (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹300/800/1200), taking eight to nine hours.
Two daily trains go to Chandigarh (2nd class/AC chair ₹120/430, four hours) at 5.15am and 5.30pm.
The daily 6.45pm Amritsar–Howrah Mail links Amritsar with Varanasi (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹500/1340/1950, 22 hours) and Kolkata’s Howrah train station (₹695/1850/2720, 37 hours).
Ten daily trains go to Pathankot (2nd class/AC chair ₹65/255, three hours),leaving between 4.40am and 8.30pm.
8 Getting Around Free yellow buses run between the train station and the Golden Temple from 4am to 9pm. Otherwise, from the train station to the Golden Temple, a rickshaw/autorickshaw will cost around ₹50/70 but you’ll have to haggle like fury for a fair price. Taxis loiter around the station, or there’s a prepaid taxi booth (

 ; %9888561615) at the southeast entrance to the Golden
Temple. To the airport, an autorickshaw costs around ₹250 and a taxi about double.
BORDER CROSSING – ATTARI-WAGAH (PAKISTAN)
Because of the tense relations between India and Pakistan, few foreigners actually cross the border between Attari and Wagah. However, plenty of people come to watch the curious border-closing ceremony every evening.
The border is 30km west of Amritsar; buses run from Amritsar to Attari (₹30), from where it’s a 2km walk to the customs post (or ₹10 in a shared auto). The border ceremony is held a few hundred metres beyond the customs post.
BORDER HOURS
Officially, the border is open from 10am to 3.30pm daily, but confirm that the border is open at all before you leave Amritsar, and arrive at least an hour before the border closes.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
There are banks with moneychanging facilities and ATMs at both sides of the border, but it’s wise to also change some money in Amritsar first.
ONWARD TRANSPORT
From Wagah (Pakistan) there are buses and taxis to Lahore, 30km away.
VISAS
Visas are theoretically available at the Pakistan embassy in Delhi; however, it is almost always easier to obtain a Pakistan visa in your home country.

Jammu & Kashmir (including Ladakh)Why Go?
J&K combines three incredibly different worlds into one state. Hindu Jammu, the state's major railhead, is a busy hub for domestic pilgrims. Muslim Kashmir is India's Switzerland, attracting hoards of local tourists seeking cool summer air, alpine scenery and Srinagar’s romantic houseboat accommodation. For most foreigners, J&K’s greatest attraction is the Himalayan land of Ladakh, whose disarmingly friendly, ethno-linguistically Tibetan people are predominantly Buddhist. Their timeless monasteries are set between arid canyons and soaring peaks with emerald-green villages nestled photogenically in highland deserts.
Although Kashmir has been relatively calm of late, be aware that it is politically volatile and arguments over its status caused three 20th-century wars. Ladakh is altogether different, a meditatively calm world, where the main concern is giving yourself ample time for high-altitude acclimatisation. Note that Ladakh is inaccessible by road outside the summer season.
When to GoA Apr–Jun Kashmir is in full bloom but overloaded with domestic tourists. Prices peak.
A Jul–Aug Perfect for Ladakh; rain drenches Jammu. Countless pilgrims flood to Amarnath.
A Winter Ski season at Gulmarg. Ladakh has festivals, but no road access for tourists.

Jammu & Kashmir Highlights
1 Murmuring meditative mantras in the mural-decked gompas (Tibetan Buddhist monasteries) of the Indus Valley, such as at Chemrey or Thiksey.
2 Escaping India’s humid summer heat in entrancing Leh, a traveller hub with dusty medieval backstreets, a Potala-style palace and a deep sense of ecological awareness.
3 Experiencing the stark magnificence of Ladakh with a hassle-free homestay trek in the glorious traffic-free Markha Valley.
4 Enjoying an amusingly caricatured Raj-type experience relaxing on a deluxe Dal Lake houseboat in Srinagar.
5 Gawping at the mountain-valley scenery backing surreally blue Pangong Tso or the splendid Nubra Valley.LADAKH
Spectacularly jagged, arid mountains enfold this magical, Buddhist ex-kingdom. Picture-perfect gompas (Tibetan Buddhist monasteries) dramatically crown rocky outcrops amid whitewashed stupas and meditational mani walls topped with countless mantra-inscribed pebbles. Colourful fluttering prayer flags spread their spiritual messages metaphorically with the mountain breeze. Prayer wheels spun clockwise release more merit-making mantras. Gompa interiors are colourfully awash with murals and statuary of numerous bodhisattvas.
Ladakh’s remarkably well-balanced traditional society has much to teach the West in terms of ecological awareness. While most Ladakhis are cash poor, traditional mudbrick homesteads are large, comfortable and self-sufficient in fuel and dairy products, organic vegetables and barley used to make tsampa (roast barley flour) and chhang (barley booze). Such self-sufficiency is an incredible achievement given the short growing season and very limited arable land in this upland desert, where precious water supplies must be laboriously channelled from glacier-melt mountain streams.
Ladakh is hemmed in by walls of dramatic mountains. This makes for unforgettable landscapes, but be aware that road access requires crossing tortuous high passes that close altogether from around October to May (or longer when snows are heavy).
History Ladakh’s (now-deposed) royal family traces its dynasty back 39 generations to AD 975. They took the name Namgyal (Victorious) in 1470 when their progenitor Lhachen Bhagan, ruling from Basgo, conquered a competing Ladakhi kingdom based at Leh/Shey. Although Ladakh had been culturally ‘Tibetanised’ in the 9th century, Buddhism originally arrived in an Indian form that’s visible in ancient temple artisanship at Alchi. Over time, however, different Buddhist sects struggled for prominence, with theTibetan Gelukpa order eventually becoming the majority philosophy after its introduction in the 14th century by Tibetan pilgrim Tsongkhapa (who left a curious relic at Spituk).
Ladakh’s greatest king, Sengge Namgyal (r 1616–42) gained riches by plundering gold reserves from western Tibet and re-established a capital at Leh. Ladakh remained an independent kingdom until the 1840s when the region was annexed by the Jammu maharajas. The Namgyals eventually passed Leh Palace to the Indian Archaeological Survey and retired to their summer palace at Stok.
Ladakh is now a pair of subdistricts within J&K. That’s a culturally odd situation for this ‘little Tibet’, which is one of the last relatively undisturbed Tantric Buddhist societies on Earth. When tourism was first permitted in 1974 commentators feared that the area would lose its identity, but the traditional lifestyle of the Ladakhis has proved unexpectedly robust to outside influences. Meanwhile locally relevant technologies, such as solar energy and Trombe thermal-storage walls, have helped to improve rural living standards.
Ladakh news and weather reports are available online through
www.reachladakh.com.
1 Climate Ladakh’s short tourist season (July to early September) typically sees mild-to-hot T-shirt weather by day, but pleasant, occasionally chilly nights. Early July is great for flowers and peaks still dusted with snow, but August is better for high passes, which can still be snowbound into July. On higher treks night-time temperatures can dip below 0°C even in midsummer. By September snow is likely on higher ground although major passes usually stay open until October. Access roads close entirely in winter when temperatures can fall below – 20°C and most tourist infrastructure shuts down.
Ladakh enjoys sunshine an average of 300 days a year, but storms can brew suddenly. Although rare, heavy rain can cause devastating mud slides, assudde   y.    t oug   a e,   eavy  a    ca  cause devastat   g    ud s  des, as happened in August 2010 when such cloudbursts killed around 200 people.
1 Language Though they use the same script, the Tibetan and Ladakhi languages are significantly different.
The wonderfully all-purpose word jule (pronounced 'joo- lay') means ‘hello’, ‘goodbye’, ‘please’ and ‘thanks’. To the greeting khamzang, simply reply khamzang. Zhimpo-rak means ‘it’s delicious’. Rebecca Norman’s excellent Getting Started in Ladakhi (₹200) has more phrases and useful cultural tips.
2 Activities In summer Ladakh is an adventure playground for outdoor types. Leh’s vast range of agents can quickly arrange climbing, rafting, high-altitude trekking and jeep tours.
Leh
%01982 Pop 30,870 Elev 3520m
Few places in India are at once so traveller-friendly and yet so enchanting and hassle-free as mountain-framed Leh. Dotted with stupas and crumbling mudbrick houses, the Old Town is dominated by a dagger of steep rocky ridge topped by an imposing Tibetan-style palace and fort. Beneath, the bustling bazaar area is draped in a thick veneer of tour agencies, souvenir shops and tandoori-pizza restaurants, but a web of lanes quickly fans out into a green suburban patchwork of irrigated barley fields. Here, gushing streams and narrow footpaths link traditionally styled Ladakhi homes and hotels with flat roofs, sturdy walls and ornate wooden window frames. Leh’s a place that’s all too easy to fall in love with, but take things easy on arrival. The altitude means that most visitors initially suffer mild headaches and breathlessness. To prevent this becoming full-blown acute mountain sickness (AMS), drink plenty of fluids(ginger tea is considered especially helpful) and avoid strenuous exertion at first. It’s wise to wait several days before trekking or taking jeep excursions to Tso Moriri or Pangong.Leh

Bearing a passing similarity to the Potala Palace in Lhasa (Tibet), this nine- storey dun-coloured palace is Leh's dominant structure and architectural icon. It took shape under 17th-century king Sengge Namgyal but has been essentially unoccupied since the Ladakhi royals were stripped of power and shuffled off to Stok in 1846. Today the sturdy walls enclose some exhibition spaces and a small prayer room, but the most enjoyable part of a visit is venturing up to the uppermost rooftops for the view.
Interesting structures ranged around the palace’s base include the prominent

This mysterious whitewashed cube is the shrine of Leh’s guardian deity. While not much to see in itself, its rocky outcrop setting offers superb 360-degree views over the city through colourful strings of prayer flags.
LEH – WATER & ECO-AWARENESS
Water is precious – those streams you see cascading beside virtually every lane aren’t a sign of plenty but an elaborate network of irrigation channels that keep Leh from reverting to a dusty mountain desert. Anything you can do to save water is a positive step. Bucket baths save a lot of water over showers, and some guesthouses offer traditional water-free Ladakhi long-drop toilets that recycle human waste into compost. But don’t put anything nonbiodegradeable down the hole: whatever goes in will end up on the farmer’s field in a year or two.
To save Leh from vanishing under a sea of plastic bottles, refills of purified, pressure- boiled water are provided by environmental organisations Dzomsa and LEDeG. Both provide recycling and disposal services. Dzomsa has an ecofriendly laundry (₹95 per kg)and serves locally sourced tsestalulu (sea buckthorn) and apricot juices that avoid packaging.

Multiple mudbrick buildings tumble merrily down a steep hillock towards Spituk village on the Indus riverbank. The courtyard below the gilt-roofed Skudung Lhakhang leads to a colourful dukhang (prayer hall) containing a yellow-hatted statue of Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), who spread Gelukpa Buddhism. A Buddha statue across the same room supposedly incorporates a very odd relic: Tsongkhapa’s nose-bleed.
On the very top of the gompa hill is a three-tiered latho (spirit shrine) and the small Palden Lamo temple hiding veiled Hindu-style deities and festival masks in an intimate rear section.

Mountaineering
Ladakh has over 100 climbable peaks above 6000m, many rarely, if ever, scaled. A popular destination is 6121m Stok Kangri (Kanglha-jhal ), the triangular snow- capped ‘trekking peak’ usually visible straight across the valley from Leh. Although accessible to those with minimal climbing experience, scaling its uppermost slopes requires ice axes, ropes, crampons, considerable fitness and an experienced guide. Pre-climb acclimatisation is essential as AMS can be a serious worry. Five-day agency packages from Stok or Zingchen, cost around ₹15,000 per person in a large group (permits and gear extra).

Climbing Permits
IMF (www.indmount.org) peak fees apply for climbing mountains over 6000m, starting from US$50 per person (Stok Kangri), but varying according to summit altitude. Peaks over 7000m require special permission from Delhi and can take months of preparation. However, most others are issued in minutes through the IMF's jovial Leh representative, Sri Sonam Wangyal, who was the youngest man
to scale Mt Everest back in 1965. His house-office (IMF;

Rafting & Kayaking
In summer, numerous agencies offer daily rafting excursions through glorious canyon scenery. Experienced paddlers can follow in a kayak for around 50% extra. Prepare to get very wet. Relatively easy Phey–Nimmu (grade II,beginners, mid-July to late August) typically costs ₹1200; while tougher and more picturesque Chiling–Nimmu (grade III, late June to early September) generally costs around ₹1600 including equipment and lunch (bring extra drinking water).

Once or twice a year given enough interest, group expeditions descend the Zanskar River from Zangla to Nimmu (three days rafting, three days travel; see www.rimoriverexpeditions.com for more details).
Trekking & Jeep Safaris

LADAKHI FESTIVALS
Buddhist temple festivals abound in Ladakh and Zanskar. Most follow a relatively similar formula with masked dances in a square or monastery precinct watched by a fair proportion of locals dressed in traditional goncha-robe costumes. Men might sport tall gonda hats with some women wearing perak 'crowns' encrusted with turquoise. The most genuine festivals are usually in December at Losar (Ladakhi New Year) and February/March during Dosmoche (Buddhist New Year) notably in Leh, Diskit and Likir where effigies representing the evil spirits of the old year are burnt or cast into the desert. Around the same time at Matho's monastery, oracles perform blindfolded acrobatics and ritual mutilations. Several other monastery festivals are now held in the summer, but tourists often form a large proportion of the crowd. For a detailed online festival calendar, see www.reachladakh.com/festival_dates.htm.
Leh's tourist-friendly Ladakh Festival (Leh; hlate-Sep) is a fun celebration including several days of Buddhist dances, polo, music and archery.
Silk Route Festival is a new, vibrant celebration of Nubra Valley culture including archery contests, camel riding and dances.T Tours

Informative small-group walking tours peek into some 'secret' corners and get you inside a couple of usually closed ancient houses/temples. Start from Lala’s Art Cafe, where you should book ahead. Tours last around two hours.
LADAKH PERMITS
To visit Nubra Valley, Pangong Tso, Dha-Hanu, Tso Moriri and the Upper Indus (beyond Upshi) you’ll need an inner line permit (valid seven days, non-extendable). Indian citizens
can go direct to the DCO (Deputy Commissioner's Office; 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Polo Ground;
h10am-3pm Mon-Sat). Foreigners’ permit applications must be made through travel agencies. Apply by 2pm the day before travel or on Saturday for Monday departures. Foreigners typically pay around ₹500. That's ₹20 per day of validity plus ₹70 Red Cross fee, agency fee and ₹300 environmental fee. You only need to pay the latter charge once and might have already done so on arrival in Ladakh (most commonly at Upshi), so make sure you keep the receipt voucher.
Technically at least two people must apply together, but agencies can usually fudge this for individual travellers. Making extra copies of your inner line permit is wise.
4 Sleeping Choice is phenomenal and almost nowhere is really dire, so don't panic if our suggestions are full.
Room standards can vary significantly within each property so, when possible, look before you book. For ultra-budget places, try the back alleys of Upper Changspa. For garden homestay-guesthouses around the ₹800 mark look in Upper Karzoo. For slightly plusher family guesthouses Upper Tukcha is a good bet. Staying out at Sankar or Yurthung can be idyllically peaceful, but there'll be a fairly long, dark walk home from town (₹150 by taxi byday).
Many guesthouses will provide towels on request, but you'll usually have to buy your own toilet paper which should generally not be flushed: when there's a plastic bin, use that.
In winter most accommodation closes; those guesthouses that stay open often charge a ₹100 heating supplement and might only offer bucket water because pipes freeze.

REACHING LADAKH
Only two road routes, both beautiful but seasonal, link Ladakh to the rest of India. The route to Manali is spectacular, but long and arduous; to Srinagar, crossing the perilous Zoji La scares the momos out of many first-time travellers. Both roads close altogether from October or November until May, leaving flying as the only option for reaching Leh. Allow at least a couple of spare days in case of delays.
On entering Ladakh, if you are asked to pay an 'environmental fee' (Indian/foreigner ₹200/300), keep the receipt and present it when applying for permits.
8 Getting There & Away
AIR
Flights are dramatically scenic, but can be cancelled at short notice. Although flying into Leh means you’re likely to suffer mild altitude problems on arrival, the Delhi–Manali–Leh drive is arguably worse, as you’ll cross passes over 5000m. Flying to Leh is the only way to reach Ladakh once roads close in
winter. Jet Airways (

(%01982-252076; Airport; h6am-noon) fly to Delhi. Air India also serves Srinagar (Wednesday) and Jammu (Monday and Friday). Fly to Jammu for Dharamsala.
BUSThe main bus station ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) is 700m south of the town centre via
the Kigu-Tak stepped bazaar from Friendship Gate ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ).MOTORCYCLE
Numerous companies along Music School Rd and Changspa Rd hire Enfield Bullet motorcycles (₹1000 to ₹1500 per day) and scooters (₹700). Double- check insurance, fittings and brakes. Carry spare fuel for longer trips: Ladakh’s only petrol stations are at Leh, Choglamsar, Serthi near Karu (NH1 Km440.5), Diskit (opening unreliable), Spituk, Phyang junction, Khalsi (NH1 Km338.7), Wakha and Kargil (two).
SHARED JEEP
Services from the bus station (arranging one day ahead): A Kargil (₹900 to
₹1000 per seat, seven hours) Runs throughout the morning.
A Srinagar (front/back seats ₹2500/2000, 15 hours) Departures around 4.30pm.
From the parking lot near the zabakhana, just southeast of the Polo Ground
(without booking): A Diskit (₹400) and possibly Sumur (₹500) or other Nubra jeeps. Departures are before 8am.
From the southern end of Moti Market: A Choglamsar & Spituk (₹20) Shared taxis depart relatively frequently to Choglamsar, but only sporadically to Spituk.
TAXI & CHARTER JEEPS
Given irregular buses and many fellow travellers, chartering a vehicle makes eminent sense for visiting rural Ladakh. Fares are set by the drivers' unon and published in an annually updated booklet so there's no haggling, though sometimes booking via a small local agency can get you a minor discount (and a reliable driver). We quote the lowest standard rates, ie for taxi-vans or Sumo charter-jeeps. Prices are 5% to 10% higher for Scorpio/Innova jeeps. Rates include reasonable photo-and visit-stops, but longer waits are officially chargeable (₹256/1033/2065 per hour/half-day/full day) and for extra overnight stops add ₹350. Requesting unplanned diversions from the agreed route once en route can cause unexpected difficulties, so plan carefully.
Taxi & Charter-Jeeps from LehTRAIN
There’s no railway. Some agencies, plus a cash-only train booking room (h8am-6pm) at Trishul Army Camp near the airport, sell all India train tickets. Check the train number required before going.8 Getting Around
TO & FROM AIRPORT
The airport (Km430, Leh–Spituk Hwy) is 4km south of the centre. Taxi transfers cost ₹230/300 to central Leh/Changspa.
TAXI
Leh’s little micro-van taxis charge from ₹100 per hop. Flagging down rides rarely works; go to a taxi stand to make arrangements.
TREKKING IN LADAKH & ZANSKAR
Bargain value, thrillingly scenic treks can take you into magical roadless villages, through craggy gorges and across stark breathless mountain passes flapping with prayer flags.
SEASONS
Trekking season is almost exclusively July and August, but in the Markha and Sham areas routes can be feasible from May to early October. Late August is usually preferable for trails with significant river crossings due to lower water levels. In February you could attempt the challenging Chadar ice-trek. (Click here)
PREPARATION
Most trekking routes start around 3500m, often climbing above 5000m, so proper acclimatisation is essential to avoid Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). You could acclimatise with ‘baby’ treks or by adding extra (if less interesting) days to the core treks, for instance starting from Lamayuru, Spituk or Martselang rather than Hinju/Photoksar, Zingchen or Shang Sumdo.
Consider pre-booking a jeep transfer back from your finishing point.
Carry a walking stick and backed sandals for wading rivers.
Water-filtering bottles are very helpful.
HORSES TREKS
At these altitudes carrying heavy packs is much more exhausting than many anticipate. For wilder routes, engaging packhorses reduces the load and the accompanying horseman can often double as a guide. Agencies will very happily arrange all-inclusive packages with horses, guides, food and (often old) camping gear. If you’re self-sufficient and patient it’s often possible to find your own horseman for between ₹400 and ₹700 per horse per day. Note that you’ll generally need to engage a minimum of four horses, and pay for any extra days needed for them to return to their next starting point. During harvest season (August) availability drops and prices rise.HOMESTAY TREKS
Almost all rural villages along well-trodden trekking routes offer very simple but wonderfully authentic homestays. In Zanskar/Markha Valley the cost is fixed at
₹500/800 per head including simple meals that are often taken in the traditional family kitchen where pots and pans are proudly displayed above the Aga-style winter stove. Mudbrick rooms generally have rugs, blankets and solar-battery electric lamps.
Smaller villages do occasionally run out of homestay beds, but even then you can usually find floor space in the kitchen or dining room. Bigger villages such as Rumbak, Hinju and Skiu/Kaya can generally handle all comers, but they work on a rota system so sometimes you'll find one homestay jammed full while others remain entirely empty.
You might also find seasonal parachute cafes; so named because they are tents made from old army parachutes, these provide tea and simple snacks and sometimes offer very basic lodging.
Having an experienced local guide is not just useful for route finding, but also for making social interactions more meaningful at homestays. With a couple of days’ notice you can engage a guide through Hemis National Park Guide Service (

Around Leh – South & East
%01982
Combine several of the following destinations to make a full-day taxi-trip, or visit one or two as part of a jeep excursion to Pangong, Tso Moriri or Nubra via Wari La.Stok
Stately three-storey Stok Palace (admission ₹50; h8am-1pm & 2-7pm May-Oct) is a
smaller and more intimate version of Leh's. And, as the summer home to Ladakh’s former royal family, it feels much more 'lived-in', though the overall scene is marred by a giant telecommunication tower. A handful of 'museum' rooms display family treasures, including the queen’s ancient turquoise-and-gold yub-jhur (crown) and a sword that the king’s oracle managed to bend into a knot,Uri Geller style. The palace’s cafe (tea ₹20, sandwiches ₹80-100) is well appointed with open terrace seating and spendid views. But for a really unique experience, rent one of five 'secret' guest rooms (%01982-254976, 9797559799; nirlac@vsnl.net; r ₹15,000-30,000), lavished with brooding original murals (plus excellent new bathrooms). There's no reception so you'll need to make advance arrangements.
Across from the palace's base, 350-year-old Stok Abagon (%9906988325; suggested donation ₹20), is the decrepit former home of the royal physician. Calling its unlit old kitchen and storeroom a ‘museum’ is a serious overstatement, but the fun of a visit is simply getting in and meeting the wizened old lady key- keeper. Bring a torch.
Stok’s peaceful main lane winds up past whitewashed farmhouses, crumbling old stupas and a new seated Buddha statue. After 1.4km it bypasses the modest Stok Gompa , where royal oracles make predictions about the future during Stok’s important Guru Tse-Chu festival (hFeb/Mar). Another kilometre south, buses from Leh terminate at a pair of simple food shacks known as the trekking point. Three homestays near here cater to late-arriving hikers. Ten minutes’ walk upstream from here on the path towards Rumbak, the village’s last
riverside house is Gyalpo Homestay (%9797456379; per person incl full-board ₹800),
simple but very authentic with wall murals and a full-blown Ladakhi kitchen.
Matho
Matho Gompa (%01982-246085; admission ₹50; h9am-6pm) is a large Sakya-
Buddhist monastery perched on a colourfully stratified ridge above Matho village. Incomparable views from here encompass a vast swathe of the mountain-backed Indus Valley, from emerald-green field patchworks to areas of sandy desert. The monastery itself is attractive, but most of the early-15th- century structure has been replaced and the top-floor museum is only one room. A thanka restoration workshop opens sporadically. During the monastery’s famous Matho Nagrang festival (Matho; hFeb-Mar), a pair of monk-oracles performs daring physical challenges while effectively blindfolded by mop-wigs, ‘seeing’ only through the fearsome ‘eyes’ painted on their chests. They also engage in ritual acts of self-mutilation and make predictions for the coming year.Stakna
Small but visually impressive, Stakna Gompa (admission ₹30; h8am-7pm) rises like an apparition out of the Indus Valley floor. Off the gompa’s small central courtyard, four rooms have vivid new Tantric murals. Behind the main prayer hall, sub-shrines retain 400-year-old sandalwood statues, original frescoes and statuettes of the Bhutanese lamas who founded the monastery in 1618. From the Leh–Thiksey road (Km449), the complex is a 1.7km drive, half that on foot), crossing the Indus on a narrow suspension bridge decked with prayer flags.
Shey
Once one of Ladakh’s royal capitals, Shey is an attractive, pond-dappled oasis from which rises a central dry rocky ridge, inscribed with roadside Buddha carvings (Km459). Along the rising ridgetop, a series of fortress ruins bracket the three-storey, 17th-century Naropa Royal Palace , whose wholesale reconstruction is nearing completion. The palace temple contains a highly revered 7.5m-tall gilded-copper Buddha, originally installed in 1645. The upper door opens to his inscrutably smirking face.
Experienced teachers are in demand for volunteer work at Druk White
Lotus School (www.dwls.org).
LEH–MANALI
Utterly beautiful, but exhaustingly spine-jangling, this is a ride you won’t forget. The Upshi–Keylong section crosses four passes over 4900m, and then there’s the infamously unpredictable Rohtang Pass before Manali. Although the road is ‘normally’ open from June to late September, unseasonable snow or major landslides can close it for days (or weeks). BCM (www.bcmtouring.com), LAHDC (http://leh.nic.in) and High Road (http://vistet.wordpress.com/) report the road’s current status.
TRANSPORT OPTIONS
Bus & Minibus The cheapest option is taking the 5am HRTC bus to Keylong (₹525, 12 hours) then changing there. Buy tickets from the driver the afternoon before. To identify the bus, spot its HP42 number plate.
Marginally more comfortable HPTDC ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ; %9622374300; Fort Rd;h10am-1.30pm & 2.30-7pm) buses (₹2500, two days) leave every second day at 5am from outside J&K Bank (Ibex Rd). Pre-book upstairs opposite Iceland Travel. The fare includes overnight accommodation at Keylong in rather cold tents.
Non stop 11-seater Tempo minibuses depart from Zangsti Parking at around 1am (15 to 21 hours). Tickets cost ₹2000 through agencies, ₹1800 direct from Ladakh Maxicab
Union ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %01982-253192). Book two days ahead for a decent seat.
Rental Jeeps Officially, charter jeeps making one or more overnight stops want at least ₹17,700. Asking around the Manali drivers' area of the bus station, many vehicles demanded ₹20,000 but with persistance we found a ₹12,000 deal.
Driving There’s no petrol station for 365km between Karu and Tandi (8km south of Keylong). Driving northbound, the Rohtang Pass requires permits (Click here). On Tuesdays the pass is closed northbound for all private vehicles, including taxis.
ROUTE HIGHLIGHTS
The Manali road heads south at Upshi (Km425) via Miru (Km410), a pretty village with a shattered fortress and numerous stupas. Beyond is a beautiful, narrow valley edged with serrated vertical mineral strata in alternating layers of vivid red purple and ferrous green. A millennium ago, Gya (Km398) was the capital of King Gyapacho’s upper Ladakhi monarchy before he joined forces with Tibetan Prince Skiddeyimagon (who shifted the power centre to Shey). Today it’s a small, picturesque village across the river from which a steep 15-minute hike leads up to the 1000-year-old castle ruin now partly occupied by a lovable little gompa. Rumtse (Km394), with its handful of homestays and camping spots, is the last green oasis and there are no further villages for 250km, just tiny seasonal camp-settlements. Numerous hairpins climb to Taglang La (Km364), which at 5328m is claimed to be the world’s second-highest road pass (after Khardung La). Further south, the wide Moray Plains are edged with smooth peaks. At Km287, 10km beyond Pang, the road rises through a memorable, spiky-edged canyon before crossing Lachlung La (5060m) and Nakila La (4915m), descending the 21 switchbacks of the Gata Loops and trundling through two very photogenic valleys featuring Cappadocia-style erosion formations.
SOUTHBOUND ADVANTAGES
If doing the trip southbound, you’ll be better acclimatised for high-altitude sleeps (Pang or Sarchu); you could visit Tso Moriri en route; and, if there’s a major landslide on the Rohtang Pass, you could ‘escape’ by walking two hours down to Marhi, a group of cafes jammed with day-trip tourist traffic from Manali.
WHICH OVERNIGHT STOP?
Overnighting in Sarchu handily breaks the Leh–Manali journey into two roughly equal sections, but the altitude (around 4000m) can cause problems. Note that there are essentially two Sarchus: cheap parachute tent-cafes at Km222, and upper-market tent camps on an attractive plateau at Km216-214.Keylong, Jispa (Km138-139) and Gemur (Km134) offer more comfortable accommodation at significantly lower altitudes, but Leh–Keylong is a very long day’s ride.
To make Leh–Manali a three-day ride you might stop in Keylong and Pang (4634m), but Pang’s parachute cafes are very basic and the unacclimatised might need Pang army camp’s free oxygen if altitude sickness hits.
Other parachute cafes are available at Debring (Km343 & Km340), Km270, Bharatpur (Km197), Zingzingbar (Km174), Km159.5 and Darcha Bridge (Km143).
Thiksey
Glorious Thiksey Gompa (%01982-267011; www.thiksey-monastery.org; admission ₹30, video ₹100; h6am-1pm & 1.30-6pm, festival Oct/Nov) is one of Ladakh’s biggest and most
recognisable monasteries. Covering a large rocky outcrop with layered Tibetan- style buildings, it’s a veritable monastic village incorporating shops, a school, a restaurant and a hotel. The main gompa starts with a prayer chamber containing a 14m-high Buddha whose expression is simultaneously peaceful, smirking and vaguely menacing. Smaller but much more obviously ancient is the Gonkhang and little rooftop library. A museum (Thiksey Gompa) hidden away beneath the monastery restaurant displays well-labelled Tantric artefacts, including a wine- vessel made from a human skull. Notice the 10 weapons symbolically used to combat evil spirits.
Over 40 monks gather for morning chanted-prayers at 6am, lasting around two hours. It’s a fascinating ceremony and visitors are welcome, but it’s so popular that tourists often outnumber worshippers.
Pedestrian access is a steep climb from near Km455. By car it’s a 1.5km loop starting from Km454.2 where monastery-run Chamba Hotel (%9418178481,
01982-267385; www.thiksay.org; NH1 Km454.2, Thiksey; s/d ₹2750/3630, old d ₹700) has an
appealing restaurant with Ladakhi-style decor that makes a popular breakfast stop for group tours. The majority of rooms are new and unexpectedly plush with geyser-heated water. For great monastery views request rooms 401 or 402. A few simple, older rooms have en-suite squat toilets.
HemisThe 1672 Hemis gompa (www.drukpa-hemis.org; admission ₹100; h8am-1pm & 2-6pm) is
the spiritual centre of Ladakh’s Drukpa Buddhists. The vibrant, wealthy complex is hidden in a high sharp valley behind curtains of craggy red rocks that look especially dramatic when the mountains behind are misty with low cloud. The main monastery’s rectilinear exterior lacks the vertically stacked perfection of Chemrey or Thiksey, but inside, the fine central courtyard is full of colourfully detailed timbers. The monastery's extensive museum mixes precious religious treasures with spurious tiger skins, swords, a bra-shaped wooden cup-case and a stuffed ‘vulture pup’. The main prayer hall has wobbly four-storey pillars and a garish 8m-high statue of Padmasambhava with hypnotic boggle eyes, and there is plenty more to explore amid the atmospheric upper, rear shrines. There are great views from the the lovely stream path beyond the school construction site.
The annual Tse-Chu festival (hJul) sees three days of masked dances, and every 12th year (next in 2016) the festival culminates in the unfurling of Hemis’ famous three-storey-high, pearl-encrusted thangka.
The nearest bus service is from Karu, 7km away by a road that partly follows two astonishingly long mani walls.
Chemrey & Takthog
Spectacularly viewed across barley fields and buckthorn bushes, Chemrey village is dominated by the beautifully proportioned Thekchhok Gompa (₹50;
hmuseum 8.30am-1pm & 2-6pm, festival Nov), covering a steep hillock with a maze of
pathways and Tibetan buildings. Above the appealingly wobbly 17th-century prayer hall, the Lama Lhakhang has murals blackened to semi-invisibility by butter-lamp smoke. On the penultimate floor the Guru Lhakhang has contrastingly vivid colours and a 3m-high golden Padmasambhava statue encrusted with turquoise ornamentation.
The monastery access lane starts from near Km7.3 on the Karu–Pangong road. At Km10.4, a paved side-lane leads through Sakti, a spread-out village of gently terraced fields, waterlogged meadows and dry-stone walls. The lane skirts Sakti’s shattered stone fortress ruins and after nearly 5km, passes beside Takthog (Dakthok) Gompa (donation appropriate; hfestival Jul), the region’s onlyNyingmapa monastery. The name Takthog (‘stone roof’) refers to a pair of small but highly revered and smoke-blackened cave-shrines in which the great 8th- century sage Padmasambhava reputedly meditated.
Markha Valley & Rumbak
Ladakh's most celebrated trekking routes follow a comparatively straight- forward yet scenically glorious route through the Markha Valley then over the breathless but walk-up Kongmaru La (5260m). Starting from Chiling/Kaya, as far as Hankar you'll find villages in barley-field oases every two or three hours' walk, contrasting very photogenically with the stark, dry, spikily upturned strata all around them. Highlights include tiny Tacha Gompa , 25 minutes before Umlung (Umblung) and the shattered fortress ruin at Upper Hankar. Both are perched improbably atop razor-sharp ridges.
For now, there is no road in the valley, so absolutely zero traffic, but you'd better hurry. A new Zanskar River bridge 4km south of Chiling was completed in late 2014…so before long 'progress' will likely be bulldozed to the timeless Markha hamlets.
Doing the whole three-to-seven-day route is perfectly feasible without carrying sleeping bags, tents or significant provisions. That's thanks to homestays (₹800 per person including dinner, breakfast and an egg-potato- chapati packed lunch) in virtually every settlement plus a ₹1000 tent-stay camp (similar deal) at Nimaling, the freezing-nights 'base camp' for the Kongmaru La. In season and good weather, finding the route is usually easy without a guide – just follow the donkey droppings. Unless water levels are very high, there are only two unbridged river crossings (four if starting from Zingchen), but those can be calf deep so carry a spare pair of backed sandals for wading. If there’s even a hint of cloud on the high passes, crossing them without a guide is very unwise.
Assuming you drive to the trailhead from Leh, visiting fascinating Chiling en route, and have a car waiting for you at Shang Sumdo, reasonably fit hikers should budget on four days of roughly seven-hour walks, sleeping at
Sara/Nakdeng, Hankar and Nimaling. For shorter sections take five or six days and stop at Skiu Markha Umlung/Hankar and Nimaling plus  perhaps  Chokdoand stop at Skiu, Markha, Umlung/Hankar and Nimaling plus, perhaps, Chokdo to break up the long last-day descent. Incoming jeeps sometimes wait for passengers at Shang Sumdo, but otherwise the only public transport is an 8am bus on Monday and Thursday (nearest alternative Karu).
As the first two days have only gentle inclines, the Markha Trek helps you acclimatise as you go. Still, don't start too soon after arrival in Ladakh! If you're well acclimatised, you could add two or three beautiful extra days by driving from Leh to Zingchen, sleeping at the single lonely (often packed) homestay at Yurutse (three to four hours' walk from Zingchen), then crossing the Ganda La (4920m) to Shingo (six to seven hours), from which Skiu is around another three hours.
Yurutse and the entire Markha Valley falls within the Hemis National Park (per person per day ₹20), for which the modest park fees are usually collected at Shang Sumdo or Stok trekking point. Also within the park is Rumbak, a magical village with an unusually close-packed concentration of traditional Ladakhi houses. You might stay in Rumbak before scaling 6121m Stok Kangri. Rumbak to Stok village is a long day's trek across a 4900m pass, but Rumbak–Zingchen is a contrastingly easy stroll taking less than three hours (two river fords en route).
Nubra Valley
%01980
The deep cut Shyok and Nubra River Valleys (permit required) offer tremendous yet accessible scenery with green oasis villages surrounded by thrillingly stark scree slopes, boulder fields and harsh arid mountains. There are sand dunes, monasteries, a ruined palace and – at Turtuk – a whole different culture (Balti) to discover.
8 Getting There & Around By public transport start out with a shared jeep to Diskit then change. However, for photo stops and to add side excursions, it's well worth visiting from Leh by chartered jeep, at least one way. Leh–Diskit–Hunder one-way/two-day/three-day return costs from ₹4873/7279/9700 per vehicle. Leh–Turtuk one way/three-day/four-day return costs ₹7880/12,515/14,930. Add Tegar/Sumur for around ₹1500.
While most visitors go out and back via Khardung, a narrow road across the remote Wari La is now partly asphalted and allows a loop returning via pretty Tangyar to Takthog. Check conditions before departing: fords can prove tough to cross when water levels are high. A second possibility, the Khalsar–Durbuk route to Pangong Tso proved impassable due to an unbridged river when we attempted it.
NUBRA NAMES
Note that on many maps, the names for several western Nubra settlements don’t correspond at all with local reality.

Leh to Diskit
The Nubra road zigzags up stark bare-rock mountains for around 1½ hours to Khardung La (Km39), which at 5602m is claimed, albeit disputably, to be the world’s highest motorable pass. Descending again, look for marmot and dzo (yak-cow mix-breeds) around the pretty pond known rather misleadingly as Tsolding Buddha Park (Km50.5). Permits and passports are checked at both South and North Pallu Army Camps (Km24 and Km53) and there are several basic shop-cafes and homestays in Khardung village (Km71), where the scenery starts to take on a certain Grand Canyon grandeur. There are splendid Shyok Valley views at Km86 with the green fields of Tsati village far below fading at their peripheries into the grey white river sands. There are more snack shacks at Khalsar (Km95).Diskit
Elev 3144m
Diskit is centred on a brash bazaar street that leads down from the area’s only bus/taxi station, perpendicular to the Leh–Turtuk road. From the bottom of the bazaar, swing right past the Spangla Guesthouse to find an altogether softer Diskit along a lane that leads 1.5km to an area of stupas, a big mani wall, and a crumbling old Ladakhi mansion, rejoining the main road just beyond Sunrise Guest House. Above this latter junction, a 2km spaghetti of hairpins winds up to
the 17th-century Diskit Gompa (Ganden Tashi Chosling Gompa; admission ₹30; h7am-noon
& 1-7pm), a brilliant jumble of Tibetan-style box buildings piled higgledy-piggledy up a steep rocky peak that ends in a toe-curlingly vertical chasm. At the back, right-hand corner of the monastery's gonkhang (guardian spirits' temple), a white six-armed deity statue clasps a withered forearm and human scalp, supposedly body-parts of a Mongol warrior who mysteriously dropped dead when attempting to seize the monastery. The gompa entry fee includes access to a gigantic (32m) full-colour Statue of Chamba (Maitreya-Buddha) on an intermediate hill, formally inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in July 2010.
4 Sleeping & Eating Of six accommodation options in the bazaar area, Sand Dune Hotel (%01980-220022, 9419568208; r ₹400-900) has the loveliest garden – including apricot trees and hop vines – but rooms are slightly fresher in the Spangla Guesthouse (%01980-220058; r with cold/hot shower ₹700/1200, d/tr without bathroom ₹500/600). Near the base of the gompa access lane, facing the more conspicuous Olthang Hotel is the excellent-value stream- serenaded Kharyok Guesthouse (%9469176131, 01980- 220050; r with/without TV ₹900/700). Very nearby, the old faithful Sunrise Guesthouse (%9469261853; r with/without bathroom ₹500/300; hyear-round) has Diskit's cheapestrooms – musty but OK – along with en-suite options sharing a rough balcony with good gompa views.
8 Getting There & Away Shared jeeps to/from Leh's zabakhana (₹400, 4½ hours) leave when full. Departures fom Diskit bus station are mostly 6.45am to around 9am. Overloaded minibuses also depart early afternoon to virtually every main Nubra village (including Turtuk 2.30pm and Panamik 3pm) returning early morning. By charter jeep Turtuk costs ₹3159/4107 one-way/return if the Kafka-esque Nubra Taxi Union (%9469727786, 01980-220339) can be bothered to assign you a driver. A return taxi to Diskit Gompa/Tegar costs ₹300/1800.
Hunder (Hundur)
Lost in greenery and closely backed by soaring valley cliffs, Hunder village is a popular overnight stop 10km from Diskit. Hunder’s big draw, especially for domestic visitors, is the chance to ride Bactrian camels (per 15min/hr ₹200/600) through a series of photogenic sand dunes. Host camels are reputedly offspring of animals that plied the Ladakh–Xinjiang caravans up until the closure of the India–China border in the 1940s. Hunder’s dunes aren’t exactly Sahara-sized, but the landscape can prove disorientating so, if attempting to walk through them back to Diskit, bring plenty of water, stick relatively near to the road, and beware following dead-end camel tracks into impenetrable thorn thickets.
The camel mounting point is around 600m southeast of the army camp. That's nearly 3km from old Hunder where a precarious little ridgetop fort ruin rises high above the main road near the modest gompa .
With advance planning there are some interesting trekking routes, including a week-long hike to Phyang near Leh.
4 Sleeping & Eating Hunder has nearly 20 garden guesthouses plus nearly a dozen ‘luxury’ camps chargingaround ₹4000 full-board in bedded tents.
Arrange meals with your accommodation or eat at the somewhat hidden
Himalayan Guest House (mains ₹80-200, thali/rice ₹150/40), which also attempts
pasta and sandwiches.

W)
This is the closest Hunder comes to a ‘real’ hotel; the attraction here is more the balcony or bay-window views and pleasant lawn than the large, adequate if unadorned rooms. Basic toiletries provided. Lobby wi-fi works occasionally.Turtuk
The turbulent Shyok valley between Hunder and Turtuk is 80km of scenic magnificence, marred only very occasionally by military installations. The grand raw-rock valley briefly narrows near tiny Changmar, the western limit of Ladakhi-Buddhist culture. Thereafter, the rare green splashes of village are culturally and linguistically Muslim-Balti. The main centres of both Turtuk and less visited Bogdang villages are raised patchworks of fields and houses on terrace ledges above the main road. Summer sees locals carting huge bundles of barley on their backs between the apricot trees. Upper Turtuk has unforgettable views towards serrated high peaks in Pakistan: the front line is only 7km away. Indeed Turtuk itself was in Pakistan until the 1971 war.
Although there are other shortcuts, on arrival by minibus you'd be advised to get off at the 'bus stop' and follow the side river for a five-minute walk upstream to a suspension bridge. Turtuk Youl, a section of town to the right past the
Apolee Guesthouse (%9469771666, 01980-248105; Turtuk Youl; s/d incl half board
₹500/600), has the oldest knot of houses, including a small palace (khar) building
beside friendly Balti Residency (%9797330141, 01980-248024; khaliq.khan777@gmail.com;
Turtuk Youl; d/tr ₹400/550). However, the main area, Turtuk Farol, is back across the suspension bridge. Turtuk Farol has the better views and most of the best accommodation, including travellers' favourite Kharmang Guest House
(%Salim 01980-248104; s/d full board ₹1500/2400, without bathroom ₹500/600), with convivial
communal sitting area and a 360-degree panoramic rooftop view. It is building a few en-suite rooms, too. Other good, simple options include K2 (%01980-248126;
Turtuk Farol; r per person ₹200, breakfast/dinner ₹100/150) at the base of the central pond- pool, and fresh, clean Issu Homestay (%01980-248039; Turtuk Farol; per person incl 2
meals ₹350) at Turtuk Farol's eastern edge. Tent-beds at Kashmiri Homestay
(%Heydar 01980-248117; Turtuk Farol; house/tent dm incl half board ₹350/250) are Turtuk's
cheapest option.
8 Getting There & Away Shared jeeps (₹200, three hours) and overloaded minibuses (₹100, four hours) leave Turtuk at 6am forDiskit (returning 2.30pm) on a mostly well-paved lane. Bring spare permit photocopies.
Sumur, Tegar & Panamik
The Nubra River proper descends towards the Shyok from the heavily disputed Siachen Glacier, the world’s highest battleground (between India and Pakistan). The upper secton follows what is reputedly one of Ladakh’s most spectacular mountain valleys. However, foreigners can't visit this area as standard Nubra permits only allow travel as far as Hargam Bridge. That’s just after diffuse Panamik (Km44) with its pitifully underwhelming hot spring.
Much more interesting is Tegar (Tiger) village, where the unguarded three- storey shell of Zamskhang Palace (Km25) sits above the eerie rubble of Nubra’s former royal citadel (Km25). Hidden within Tegar village Zimskang Museum (donation ₹50; h4-9pm by request) is an historic house, found by descending a path alongside chortens and a mani wall from the ancient little Manekhang Gompa/Angchunk Restaurant to the last unmarked wooden door on the left. Some 1.5km above the palace, where Tegar and Sumur back lanes merge, there are lovely panoramas from the parking area at colourful, extensively rebuilt
Samstemling Gompa (donation appropriate; h6am-6pm).
Sumur has some charming back lanes and, around 2km southwest, its very own sand dunes with camel rides (per 15min ₹150) undercut the Hunder competition. It's home to the Silk Route Festival (www.heritagehimalaya.org; Sumur; h23rd-25th Jun), celebrating Nubra's archery, food and camel-culture.4 Sleeping & Eating Tegar has two midrange hotels, Panamik and Sumur have half a dozen guesthouses each. Sumur also has several tent camps and a trio of very basic cafes at the main junction.

In the heart of old Sumur, the Kailash is a brand-new low-rise with traditional windows, high willow-poplar ceilings and a spacious dining room all set on a three-level terraced garden. Excellent value at walk-in rates.

From outside this is an impressive traditional-style Ladakhi building set in farm- sized grounds. Inside, the lurid-pink trim and somewhat institutional corridors are less appealing, and room standards vary significantly.

Behind Sumur's Sand Dune Park, around 2km west of town, this new eco-lodge uses a few designer-rustic touches to add considerable charm to their three- bedroom guesthouse. There's a traditional Ladakhi kitchen and four luxury tent- rooms really are luxurious.
8 Getting There & Away Buses to Diskit depart between 8am and 8.30am. A shared taxi direct to Leh leaves 7.30am most mornings.
Pangong Tso
Stretching around 150km (with the eastern third in China), this mesmerising lake plays artist with a surreal palette of vivid blues. These contrast magically with the colourful mineral swirls of the starkly arid, snow-brushed surrounding mountains. The scene is striking for the almost total lack of habitation along shores that can look almost Caribbean. Visitor activities don't stretch much beyond oggling the ever changing lake-scapes, but one 'sight' is a sand spit nicknamed ‘Shooting Point’ as it was used as a film set for the 2009 Bollywood hit The Three Idiots.
The jeep safari from Leh is a joy in itself – scenically magnificent and constantly varied with serrated peaks, trickling streams, horse meadows, reflective ponds, drifting sands and a 5369m pass. However, it’s a tiring drive and doing the return in one day is masochism. Ideally stay at least one night in Spangmik or Man, then drive on unpaved lakeside trails to end-of-the-world Merak (10km beyond Man). It's a beautiful ride but get back early as the route can become impassable by mid-afternoon when water levels rise dramatically in the river-fords.
4 Sleeping & Eating Note that the area has no phone or internet connection so where contacts are given they're for Leh agencies. Few guests stay more than one night sothere’s almost always a vacancy if you arrive by early
afternoon, but don’t leave it too late.
Lukung
Lukung isn't a village but a series of parachute cafes. Most are there to feed day
trippers but some offer ₹200 bed spaces. There's also one very overpriced 'Inn'
and two fair-value bedded tent camps. Around 2km further are a few more lunch
shacks and Highland Camp (walk-in s/d from ₹800/1500), where en-suite tents with
metal camp-beds look straight out across the lake (and road).
Spangmik
Pretty Spangmik is Pangong's most popular accommodation spot. A victim of its
own success, there are now some 20 summer tent camps (d incl full board ₹3000-
4000 ) marring the once-picturesque, dry-stone-walled meadows. Although it's
crowded, the setting is still idyllic. Each of the dozen homesteads doubles as a
basic homestay, charging around ₹200 per person for crammed bed spaces. Only
two hotel-like options have full en-suite bathrooms: Ser Bhum Tso Resort
(%9419176660; serbhumtso@gmail.com; d rack-rate/walk-in ₹5400/3500), with its good
mattresses and picture windows, is right in central Spangmik; the somewhat
more indulgent pine-fresh bungalows of Changla Queen (%99419818253;
bungalow incl half-board ₹3500 ) are well appointed, but suffer from an isolated, arid
location 2km west, set way back from the Shooting Point.
Man
Man is quieter but more diffuse than Spangmik, and set slightly further back from the lake. There are two pleasant luxury tent camps (around ₹4000) and five basic homestays, of which our favourite is Yokma (bed/breakfast/dinner ₹250/100/150) with views from a parachute sitting area.
8 Getting There & Away Permits are required. One-/two-day jeep tours from Leh cost ₹6811/8108 to Spangmik, or ₹7867/9636 to Manand Merak. For a little more you can add side trips to Chemrey and Takthog and request a stop around halfway at the colourful rock- cleft Tangtse Gompa, which is a 10-minute walk on a footpath that starts 200m beyond the booth outside Tangtse, where you’ll stop anyway to pay the ₹10 Pangong ‘ticket’. Consider making these stops on the way back towards Leh so that outbound you get a wider choice of accommodation.
Foreigners may not continue to Chushul nor to fabled Hanle.
The Tso Moriri Loop
Elev 4595m (lake)
The following two-or three-day jeep-loop from Leh can also be made as a scenic diversion en route to Manali, but for permit reasons it’s only possible southbound. The highlights are two huge upland lakes, possible nomad- encounters and bird-watching opportunities. You’ll find far fewer visitors here than at Pangong, but the journey from Leh is considerably longer yet less scenically varied than the glorious Leh–Pangong trip.
On the first day out of Leh you’ll pass a handful of attractive villages, including Likche (Km69) and Himya (Km80). Neither have any facilities and most jeep-tours whizz straight past, stopping instead to eat at one of the ramshackle eateries above Chumathang's unappetising, garbage-strewn hot- springs area. Far nicer Chumathang village is hidden from the road, but worth the 2km detour to admire panoramic views from its gompa.
At Mahe Bridge, foreigners must show their permits. Indian nationals have to pay a nature reserve charge here (₹20 per day's intended stay), but for foreigners that’s already included in their permits’ environmental fee. Apart from Sumdo hamlet, with its basic roadside cafe-guesthouse, there’s no further habitation till Tso Moriri. However, in late July you're likely to encounter Chang Pa nomads shearing sheep after smaller Tso Kiagar.
Tso Moriri is a giant high-altitude lake whose main attraction is the magical ever-changing series of reflections in its crystal-clear waters. The cloudscapes, snow-topped bald peaks and geological swirls are hypnotic. The scene is bestbefore sunset from a viewpoint knoll around 2km south of tatty little Korzok, Tso Moriri’s only settlement.
Korzok has half a dozen very simple mat-on-floor homestay-guesthouses, most named for local birds. Our current favourite is the super-friendly Goose
(Korzok; per person without/with food ₹200/350), which has the luxury of an indoor toilet.
Korzok also has two small hotels. Though still partly unfinished, the new
Hotel Lake View (%9419345362, 9469457025; tsomoririhotellakeview@gmail.com; Korzok; rack rate s/d ₹2720/3500, walk-in r without/with view ₹1500/2000; hMay–mid-Oct) is marginally the
more comfortable. The other, with its dingy corridor but wide lakeview common
verandah, is run by Nomadic Life (%9419178984; www.nomadiclifecamp.com; Korzok; d
₹1500-2000, half board ₹2500-3000), which also has one of the settlement's four summer camps of bedded tents. Prices are highly dependent upon demand.
Tso Moriri is sometimes touted to ornithologists as a place for spotting super- rare black-necked cranes, though you're probably more likely to see those around the salt-whitened marshes that front Tso Kar. Three mating pairs have been spotted within binocular range of the Tsokar Resort (%9622925002, 9906060654; tsokarresort@yahoo.com; s/d ₹2000/2600) where the newest six en-suite rooms face the birds' early-July breeding ground. Its little restaurant, along with the next-door
Lotus Camp (%9419819078; chotsering100@yahoo.com; Thukye; d half board ₹3000; hMay-
early-Sep), represent virtually all the commercial activity in the tiny settlement of Thukye, which is less village than a small gompa and a labyrinth of stone- walled sheep-pens, used as a winter retreat for Chang Pa nomads.
From Thukye, 18km of bouncy, partly asphalted lane lead to South Debring parachute cafe on the Manali–Leh highway. Some groups trek between Korzok and Tso Kar in around five days by a somewhat different route. Before you join such an expedition be aware that you'll cross several very high passes, be subjected to very cold nights, even in mid-summer, and that there are essentially no villages en route to add interest or shelter to the trip.
8 Getting There & Away A two-day jeep charter looping Leh– Korzok–Thukye then returning to Leh across Taglang La costs ₹11,719/12,985 by Sumo/Innova. A three-day, one-way excursion doing the same but then continuing south to Keylong/Manali costsfrom ₹22,347/26,223. The only public bus runs to Korzok (₹310), leaving Leh at 6.30am on the 10th, 20th and 30th of each month, returning next morning, but there are no buses to Thukye.
Leh to Kargil
There are many fascinating sights close to the Leh–Srinagar road, but hopping by very limited public transport is slow going: other than Leh–Kargil and Leh– Srinagar through buses, the only options west from Khalsi are Leh–Dha buses (daily) and four other weekly services to Chiktan or Fokha. Lamayuru and Khalsi both have a couple of taxis but tracking them down is hit-and-miss. It makes great sense to get a group together in Leh and arrange a shared jeep with side trips at least as far as Mulbekh/Shargol, from where there are
morning/afternoon buses to Kargil.
If you're driving, don't miss short diversions to Basgo and Alchi and consider canyonland side trips to Chiling (30km) and/or Wanla-Honupatta.
The widest selection of accommodation is in Likir, Alchi and Lamayuru, but you'll also find homestays in all trekking villages. For something special there are boutique hotels at Nimmu and Nurla. The bigger village of Khalsi has shops
and the Samyas Garden Restaurant (Khalsi; mains ₹80-150, rice/thali/tea ₹60/100/15;
h7.30am-10pm), an unexpectedly pleasant oasis handily placed right beside its bazaar and bus stand.
Phyang
Pretty Phyang village is an emerald expanse of layered, tree-hemmed barley fields, 40 minutes' drive from Leh in the next parallel valley west. Follow the idyllic lane north from Phyang’s large, recently restored gompa to find Hidden
North Guest House (%01982-226007; www.hiddennorth.com; Phyang Tsakma; r ₹1000,
without bathroom ₹600-800) where a young Ladakhi-Italian family have created a delightfully relaxing getaway. Panoramic views encompass a spiky mountain horizon, meals are available and guided treks get you into accessible yet little- known corners of Ladakh. From Leh the 9am 'teachers' bus' or 5pm J&K SRTCPulungs-bound bus get you very close.
Nimmu & Chiling
If you just drive through on the main Leh highway, Nimmu seems a scrappy place. But away from the road it's very pretty. Take the lane signed Chamba Gompa for around 300m to find an (unmarked) former palace-mansion that belonged to cousins of the Ladakhi royals. Left decrepit for decades, it's now
being converted into Nimmu House (%8447757518; http://ladakh.nimmu-house.com; Nimmu; s/d incl full board ₹8880/9600), a super-stylish 12-room heritage boutique hotel
and massage-spa incorporating many remnants of the atmospheric original interior. There are also five design-book safari-size tent-rooms set in the idyllic orchard garden.
A couple of kilometres south of Nimmu are the arrival points for rafting groups who come splashing down the beautiful River Zanskar through a feast of stark, colourful geology. The same photogenic canyons can be enjoyed by road too if you drive towards Chiling, some 30km south.
At first glance tiny Chiling seems little more than a teahouse (Km28.6). But hidden above, the village proper is a fascinating place, set on a fertile green plateau, more easily accessed from a low-profile path starting at Km27.9. Chiling village was founded by the families of Nepali copper craftsmen. They originally arrived in Ladakh to build Shey Palace’s classic Buddha statue and never went home. The handicraft continues, with roughly turned-out heart- shaped spoons (around ₹250) made at photogenically antiquated little forges in a timeless area of old mudbrick buildings and giant trees. Several families here offer homestays.
If you're trekking into the Markha Valley, note that the bridge is 4km further south along a dusty sun-blasted road.
Basgo & Ney
Rising above Basgo village on a surreal collection of eroded earthen pinnacles are remnant stubs of once-great citadel walls, along with a largely derelict mud- walled palace , dating from when Basgo was a capital of lower Ladakh. It’sworth coming just for the unusual views, but you can also visit two splendid one-room temples (per temple ₹30), each containing a two-storey seated Maitreya statue.
Driving 6km north into the verdant oasis village of Ney, you'll spy the gleaming golden form of a new giant Buddha Statue. It's claimed to be nearly 26m tall, though that includes the three-storey building that forms his 'stool'.
Sham (Likir, Yangthang, Hemis Shukpachan & Timishgan)
%01982
The three-to-four day 'Sham baby trek' between Likir and Timishgan (Tingmosgan, Temisgam) is popularly used as a warm-up hike. With ample homestays along the way, you don't need to carry any camping equipment. Scenery is stark and arid with some grand Nevada-style crescendos but there’s minimal shade, and much of the route follows a paved lane. The only roadless section is the short section from Hemis Shukpachan over two minor 3830m passes to Ang.
Starting-point Likir has seven guesthouses in the lower village plus the
appealing Hotel Lhukhil (%9419892278, 9419892237; www.hotellhukhil.com; dm/d
₹500/1500; hMay-Sep), styled like a Chinese temple and offering a range of yoga and meditation retreats and well-maintained en-suite rooms. There are three further atmospheric, inexpensive homestays 4km further north behind Likir's memorable mostly 15th-century gompa complex (h8am-1pm & 2-6pm), the trademark of which is the large gilded 20th-century Maitreya-Buddha statue.
Plenty more homestays are available in the timeless intermediate villages of Yangthang and Hemis Shukpachan, beyond which Timishgan, a former co- capital of 14th-century lower Ladakh, has a dozen widely spread homestays supplemented by the comfortable, colourfully neo-traditional Namra Hotel
(%01982-229033, 9419178324; www.namrahotel.com; s/d/ste ₹2915/3465/4785, with half-board
₹4015/4565/5885) set in beautiful rustic gardens.
Timishgan, Likir Gompa and Hemis Shukpachan all have bus services from Leh.
Al hiAlchi
This rural village has become a regional tourism magnet thanks to the world
famous Choskhor Temple Complex (foreigner/Indian ₹50/20; h8am-1pm & 2-6pm),
founded in the 11th century by ‘Great Translator’ Lotsava Ringchen Zangpo. The four main temple buildings are small and unobtrusive, but they contain original interior murals that are considered the crowning glory of Ladakh’s Indo- Tibetan art. Visits (no photography allowed) start with Sumrtsek Temple fronted by a wooden porch whose carving style is very much Indian rather than Tibetan. Inside, murals cover all three levels with hundreds of little Buddhas. Oversized wooden statues of Maitreya, Manjushri and Avalokitesvara burst their heads through into the inaccessible upper storey. Next along, Vairocana Temple is impressive for its mandalas – as antique murals in the rear chamber, as contemporary exercises in coloured sand at the front. In the Lotsa Temple , Lotsava Ringchen Zangpo himself appears as the slightly reptilian figure to the left behind the central Buddha cabinet. Beneath him, a row of comical-faced figures underline the importance of taking nothing too seriously. The attached Manjushri Temple enshrines a joyfully colourful four-sided statue of Manjushri (Buddha of Wisdom). The temple compex is reached by an obvious pedestrian lane lined by guesthouses, souvenir peddlers and the Golden Oriole
(mains ₹90-200, pizza ₹200-400, rice ₹50; h7am-8pm Jul-Sep), combining ‘German’ bakery,
multi-cuisine restaurant and (rarely functioning) internet cafe.
There are a dozen accommodation options. Beside the temple complex,
Heritage Home (%9419811535, 01982-227125; www.hotelheritagealchi.com; s/d ₹1500/1750, half
board ₹2150/2550) is a pleasant midrange choice though it's not as comfortable as the idyllic garden frontage might suggest. Hidden in the apricot orchard behind,
the ultra-simple Dragung Homestay (%9491838309; dm/s/d ₹200/350/700) is a
bargain if you don't mind an outdoor walk to the bathroom.
Alchi Resort (%9419218636; www.alchiresort.tripod.com; s/d ₹1600/2468, walk-in r from
₹1000) is a collection of comfortable whitewashed duplex cottages ranged around apple trees and the gazebo of an enclosed garden area. Set amid flowers, 800m back towards Leh, friendly Choskor Guest House (%9419826363; r ₹1800-2000, walk-in r ₹600-1000) comes complete with shrine room and sits beside the once-grand Lonpo House, formerly home to the Ladakhi King’s local tax collector.

Uletokpo, Rizong & Nurla
An erosion-prone 6km side lane from Uletokpo village dead-ends at the
photogenic 19th-century Rizong Gompa (admission by donation; h7am-1pm & 1.30-
6pm), stepped handsomely up an amphitheatre of rocky cliff. A steep, sometimes treacherous footpath continues from there up to Yangthang.
Uletokpo has two 'luxury camps'. Uley Adventure Resort (%01982-252453;
http://uleresort.com; hut/cottage/suite incl full board ₹5500/8500/11,000) is a major
accommodation and activities centre for Indian family tourists, but seems overpriced, and if you just want to sleep, the super-stylish, hacienda-style
Apricot Tree (%9419866688, 01982-229525; www.theapricottreehotel.com; NH1 Km350, Nurla; s/d ₹4950/5500, incl half-board ₹6435/7150) at Nurla is far better value despite offering
one of the most luxurious hotel experiences along the whole Leh–Srinagar route.
Dha, Chiktan & Batalik
Driving up the Indus Valley northwest from Khalsi, the scenery becomes increasingly impressive with stark rocky valley-walls contrasting with apricot- and walnut-orchard villages. Picturesque Skurbuchan village is topped by a rickety gompa-fort overlooking the Indus canyon. Scattered ancient petroglyphs are inscribed on brown, time-polished roadside rocks, helpfully signposted at the Domkhar Rock Art Sanctuary, but also unmarked along the roadside such as at Km54.8.
The villages of Hanu Gongma, Biama (Beema), Dha, Garkone, Hardass and beautiful Darchiks are culturally notable for their Brokpa people (aka Drokpa or Dard), a unique 'Red Aryan' community sometimes speculated to have been descended from Alexander the Great’s invasion force. Though Buddhism (and in places Islam) has partially overlayed their traditional Bon- based religion, a few older Brokpa people still wear pearly button ear decorations, floral headwear and traditional hats, with older women tying their hair in long multistranded braids reminiscent of knotted dreadlocks. Biama isdeveloping a Brokpa interpretation centre.
Across the Indus from Biama, a well-paved road back to the NH1 crosses the Indus at Sanjak and passes beside the shattered yet impressive ruins of Razi Khar, a dramatic 16th-century palace-fortress 2km south of Chiktan.
The alternative route to Kargil runs through Darchiks, swinging south just before Batalik then climbing through a seemingly impossible mountain gully through photogenic Silmo village, crossing a pass above Lalung mudbrick village then descending past the small Muslim fertility shrine of Astana. The road winds down passing within 2km of Apati, in which hides a 5m Buddha rock-face carving. It's at the back of the village, reached by a newly stone-paved footpath that burrows 'through' a couple of older houses.
4 Sleeping & Eating Dha's old traveller hangout is the pretty but very basic Skyabapa Guesthouse (%9469535269; Dha; d ₹500) with outside dining beneath a giant grape vine. The friendly English-speaking manager makes jams and wine, and international volunteers sometimes stay to help. There are also homestays in Biama, while the region's only en-suite guest rooms are at a new hotel nearing completion in Darchiks. There is a selection of shops and very basic tea-stands in Sanjak.
8 Getting There & Away In principle, a good way to visit would be while driving the 'alternative' route between Khalsi and Kargil via Batalik. However, infuriating bureacracy means that foreigners require two permits. You must apply in Leh for the Khalsi–Dha section but in Kargil for Batalik–Darchiks–Garkone. Agencies can organise the combination but it is often just easier to do one side or the other then exit via the road through Sanjak.
Leh–Kargil charter taxis via Dha and Batalik/Chiktan cost ₹9428/7586. The daily bus from Leh to 'Dha' actually drops passengers at a dislocated gateway from which Dha is still a 20-minute walk away through the apricot trees. Thebus starts daily at 9am except Fridays, when it heads to Hanu Gongma instead. From Sanjak and Darchiks, shared taxis to Kargil run sporadically. Linking any of the settlements you'll essentially have to walk if you don't have your own vehicle.
Yapola Valley
Running south from Lamayuru is a recently improved road that will eventually lead to Zanskar. It links several relatively unspoilt villages that were 'trek-only' until the early 21st century. The biggest, Wanla, is worth a brief diversion if you're driving slowly along the Leh–Kargil road, to see its tiny medieval
gompa (www.achiassociation.org; admission ₹20; hdawn-dusk) perched on a knife-edge
ridge above town. Flanked by tower remnants of a now-destroyed 14th-century fortress, the monastery has a carved porch reminiscent of Alchi’s and its spookily dark prayer-chamber contains three large statues backed by ancient smoke-blackened murals and naive statuettes. Monks in a hut-chamber nearby keep the key.
At minuscule Phanjila a spur road diverges to appealing Hinju where homestays can arrange horses for the two-night/three-day trek to Sumdha Do/Chiling, crossing the 4950m Konze La (strenuous). South of Phanjila, a newly improved road is being widened to and through the spectacular Yapola Gorge with its soaring rocky sides, spikey mountain vistas and colourful geological pyrotechnics. Beyond is the traditional, closely clumped village of Honupatta. The scenery remains glorious as you traverse the 4720m Sisir La and descend to Photoksar. It’s likely that jeeps will soon be able to drive as far as Nerak, but reaching Zanskar is still a multiday trek.
TREKKING TO ZANSKAR
From Photoksar or Singge La base camp, the trek to Padum, Zanskar is most often undertaken in around a week as a group expedition with packhorses and full camping gear. If you're fit, well acclimatised and a little lucky, it is just about possible to walk from Singge La to Padum sleeping entirely in homestays and tent-stays. To achieve this, hiking stages from Singge La base camp (tea tent in mid-season only) would be as follows:
Day 1 Seven hours' walk to Skyunpata campsite where there's a single 'dormitory tent'.Day 2 Four hours to Lingshet – plenty of homestay options. If you have a tent you'd be advised to continue to Lamak base camp (no facilities) to reduce the next day's tough hike, but there are no non-camping options.
Day 3 Ten hours' hike from Lingshet including three hard, steep hours up the Hanuma La to Shnertse (two tea tents).
Days 4 & 5 Seven hours' hike, including the Panfila Pass to Hanumil village (three homestays). Thence to Pidmo Bridge for a (pre-booked) car to Padum or walk on to Zangla.
Note that setting off on this trek without supplies and your own tent is risky, given very limited bed-space availability.
Lamayuru
%01982 Pop 700 Elev 3390m
Set among mountain-backed badlands, low-paced Lamayuru is one of Ladakh’s most memorable villages and an ideal place to break the Kargil–Leh journey. Picturesque homes huddle around a crumbling central hilltop that’s pitted with caves and topped by the ultra-photogenic Yungdrung Gompa (Lamayuru Monastery; admission ₹100). Behind glass within the gompa’s main prayer hall is a tiny cave in which 11th-century mystic Naropa (AD 1016–1100) meditated. Before that, legend claims, this whole area had been the bottom of a deep lake whose waters receded miraculously thanks to the powerful prayers of Buddhist saint Arahat Nimagung. Sculpted by time into curiously draped erosion patterns, the sands of that former lake bed now form ‘moonland’ landscapes at the roadside around 1km east of town.
New roads to Wanla, Hinju and Photoksar challenge Lamayuru’s traditional role as a trekking trailhead, but if you’re reliant on public transport, Lamayuru still makes a possible starting point for classic hiking routes to Chiling or Zanskar with packhorses sporadically available for hire.

Lamayuru to Mulbekh
From Lamayuru, the NH1 road zigzags up towards Iguanodon-back spires that tower impressively over Fotu La (4147m). At Km281, a 12km spur road leads through memorable canyons to the very authentic village of Kanji (population 280). Little visited, except by occasional trekking groups, the village has a photogenic mini-citadel and three small gompas, including the minuscule one-
room Chuchik-Zhal Temple (www.achiassociation.org; donation appropriate) containing
three superb Alchi-style statues and two mandala murals. Konchok Trinley keeps the key.
All that most people usually see of Hansukot is the roadside tourist bungalow, but a rough side lane leads high up to the village passing the crumbling ruins of its shattered ancient fortress.
A comparatively wide, fertile valley extends as far as Khangral, where passports are checked beside the Chiktan–Sanjak–Dha turn-off. The NH1 then crosses the 3760m Namika La (Sky-Pillar Pass), named for the distinctive rocky outcrop that looks like an erupting tooth emerging through undulating elephant skin. A 15km descent brings you into the glorious Wakha Valley.
Wakha, Mulbekh & Shargol
The Wakha–Mulbekh Valley looks like a calm grass-green sea over which a vast tsunami of frothing red mountains is about to crash. It's breathtaking at sunset.
Mulbekh is best known for an 8m-high Maitreya-Buddha relief (NH1
Km243.3). That was carved over 1000 years ago into a fang of rock that's now right beside the road, its lower half shielded from view by the minuscule Chamba Gompa. Soaring above Mulbekh is the impregnable site of King Tashi Namgyal’s 18th-century castle . Burnt during an 1835 raid, only two tower stubs remain, but the site sports a small gompa and the valley views are symphonic. The 2.8km spaghetti of narrow access lane starts 100m west of Chamba Gompa opposite a red-roofed new refreshment-souvenir place.
The valley has plenty of old Ladakhi architecture including Rgyal Gompa ,where tiny troglodyte hermit cells are built improbably into eroded pillars of composite rock, located 2km east of Wakha Police Station (NH1 Km245.8). Around 10km further west, Shargol has a tiny one-monk gompa built into a cliff-face, 2km off the NH1 (turn at Km235.5).
The area's best accommodation is Horizon Camp (%9469045459;
horizonladakhcamp@gmail.com; NH1 Km245, Wakha; s/d ₹2400/2650, walk-in d ₹1500-2000), an
unusually fair-value bedded tent camp in a beautiful roadside flower garden, 150m from Wakha's petrol station. Central Mulbekh has several inexpensive guesthouses, including the photogenically traditional Karzoo (%9419827683,
01985-270027; NH1 Km242.2, Mulbekh; d/tr ₹400/550) and the friendly Othsnang (%01985- 270028, 9469280822; NH1 Km242.4, Mulbekh; per person ₹150). On the NH1, just east of
Wakha (Km246), are several cheap teahouse restaurants.
8 Getting There & Away Several overloaded Kargil-bound buses (from Chiktan, Shakar etc) pass through between 7am and 8.30am, returning from Kargil around 3pm. In the afternoon, a J&K SRTC bus leaves Shargol for Kargil at 3pm (returning 7am). Walking Mulbekh–Shargol makes an interesting 2½-hour trek following the south side of the river (one very small pass). Towards Lamayuru you're essentially limited to hitch-hiking or flagging down Leh- bound buses at around 6am.
KARGIL & ZANSKAR
Ladakh’s less visited ‘second half’ comprises remote, sparsely populated Buddhist Zanskar and the slightly greener Suru Valley, where villagers predominantly follow Shia-Islam, as they do in the regional capital, Kargil (Km204). Scenery reaches some truly majestic mountain climaxes.
Kargil
%01985 Pop 10,655 Elev 2704m
Love it or loathe it, you'll almost inevitably need to stop in proudly Muslim Kargil between Zanskar and Srinagar or Leh  If you're arriving from SrinagarKargil between Zanskar and Srinagar or Leh. If you're arriving from Srinagar, Ladakh's second city seems quaintly backward with workshops, old merchant stores and wild-eyed beggars cramming the packed, ramshackle central area. Coming from Leh, however, Kargil feels grimy and mildly hassled.
The landscape looks more attractive if you climb to the little Central Asian
Museum (Munshi Aziz Bhat Museum; %9469730109; www.kargilmuseum.org; admission ₹50; hby
arrangement), which celebrates Kargil's former glory as a trading post on major pre- 1947 caravan routes. It's around 10 minutes' walk off the central street Main Bazaar (aka Imam Khomeini Chowk, or Khumani Chowk), which has two ATMs, a few internet cafes and several ho-hum restaurants. The tourist office (%232721; h10.30am-5pm Mon-Sat) is upstairs in a vine-draped building between Main Bazaar and the well-marked Hotel Greenland, though 500m further north, tour agency Sewak Travel (We For Kargil; www.sewak.org.in) is a more useful contact. Their tours cover much of the district and they can arrange permits for the Batalik area via the DC Office in Baroo.
4 Sleeping & Eating Cheap, central but miserable options around the bus station include the ramshackle old Hotel Crown (%9419845108; muntazir98@yahoo.com; d
with/without bathroom ₹500/400) and dreary, green-concrete box rooms at Ever Green (%9419570515; tw ₹400) beside Hotel Greenland. Four marginally better cheapies stretch up Hospital Rd from the jeep stand, notably Kacho Guesthouse (%9419889045; kachoalikhan@yahoo.com; Hospital Rd; d with/without TV ₹1000/700) with its cheery little patch of garden.

Elsewhere the Jan Palace might seem unremarkable, but in central Kargil its functional combination of cleanliness, big new en-suite rooms, rooftop views and friendly staff make it stand above the competition. Reliable food and beer available (₹320). As you leave the government bus station's main exit, it's in an alley to your right.

A professional hotel-style lobby leads through to fresh new rooms with good bathrooms and a mild fashion consciousness, slightly undermined by the use of pale custard-yellow wall-paint. It's the best of the four upper midrange options that lie south of centre beyond Bardo Bridge, around half way to Baroo.
Wi-fi costs ₹100 per day.
8 Getting There & Away The jeep stand (Hospital Rd) and main Leh/Srinagar bus station ('Public Park') are central, one block apart, linked via a narrow alley of butchers’ and barbers’ shops. Both are a short distance off Main Bazaar towards the river. A station for Omni minivans is 400m further west and the local bus station another 400m on, towards Bardo Bridge.A Leh Buses (private/government ₹400/470, 10 hours) depart at around 4.30am, driving via Mulbekh (two hours) and Lamayuru (around five hours). You might still find a shared jeep (₹900 to ₹1000) as late as 7am. Charters cost ₹7100. A Mulbekh Minibuses (₹60) leave at 2pm and 3pm from the local bus station, returning next morning.
A Srinagar Buses (₹550, 10 hours) depart at 10.30pm driving overnight to reach the hair-raising Zoji La Pass before the one-way system for large vehicles reverses. That doesn't apply to share taxis (₹900, seven hours), which can leave any time. Road conditions permitting, it’s worth hiring your own taxi (₹6350) to experience the scenery, which is especially memorable between Drass and Kangan.
A Suru Valley For Sanku and nearer villages, red-and-white minibuses depart sporadically from the local bus station. For Panikhar (₹87) the 7am bus loads up on Main Bazaar at the Hospital Rd corner. For the noon bus and for Parkachik (11.30am, alternate days) pre-purchase tickets from the green J&K SRTC stand hidden behind the back wall of the main bus station. Around midday you might find shared Omni micro-vans to Panikhar; chartering to Panikhar/Parkachik costs ₹2100/2800.
A Zanskar Kargil–Padum buses are sporadic. Shared seven-seater jeeps
(₹2000, 10 to 14 hours) park in the main bus station departing before dawn if at all. Chartering costs ₹13,400, with an extra ₹2275 to overnight en route at Rangdum or Parkachik (well worth considering) through the central Jeep Drivers’ Cooperative (%01985-232079). Non-Kargil or non-union drivers aren't allowed to take tourists to Zanskar and checkpoints en route might turn back unofficial rides.
8 Getting Around By day, micro-vans (per seat ₹10) shuttle down the riverside to Baroo from the riverside corner of Hospital Rd.
WORTH A TRIP
KARGIL DISTRICT – LADAKH'S BAMIYAN?
Hidden away across Kargil region are several ancient rock-cut Buddha statues. Whilenowhere near as huge as Afghanistan's now-destroyed Bamiyan site, the impressive 7th- century figure at Mulbekh is 8m tall and easy to visit en route to Leh. Around 2km off the Batalik–Kargil Rd, the smaller, more eroded Yurbaltak figure lies at the back of Apati village, a short but picturesque walk from the end of the access road following a stone- paved path through the village's most traditional knot of homes. Arguably the most impressive Buddha is 5km east of Sanku in the Suru Valley, close to the tiny school on the north side of the river facing the historic settlement of Khartse Khar. The spot is five minutes' walk off the Barsoo Rd.
Suru Valley
Potentially a bigger attraction than better-known Zanskar, to which it is the main access route, Suru Valley's green, semi-alpine Muslim villages are dotted among wide valleys with fabulous snow-topped mountainscapes. These are most apparent around Damsna and are spectacularly surveyed from Parkachik and from the steep but satisfying day trek to get there across the 3900m Lago La from Pursa on the Panikhar bypass road (four to six hours' hike). If driving from Sanku, consider a 5km detour east to the Khartse Khar Buddha off Barsoo Rd.
4 Sleeping & Eating Options are sparse. Assuming you can find the chowkidar (caretaker) to open the doors, there are unpretentious but decently maintained J&K Tourist Bungalows (d/dm ₹500/200) at five Suru locations, the best choices being lonely Purtickchay (with distant but well- framed Nun–Kun views), Tangole (a possible mountaineering base) and especially Parkachik, with its stunning mountain views. Very basic guest meals are available at each.
Kamal Guesthouse (%Sajad Hussein 9469109034; sleeping/meal ₹200/100) at
Damsna has just two empty carpeted rooms for homestay guests to bed down on the floor. No English spoken. The main draw is a nearby picnic spot and the perfectly framed view of Nun and Kun – albeit only from the toilet.Near the hospital in Panikhar, Hotel Khayoul (%9469192810, 9419864611;
saki_muna@yahoo.com; Prantee district, Panikhar; d/tr ₹400/500) is the four-room homestay of
Hulam Ali, a friendly, English-speaking travel fixer with years of experience to help you make the most of any Suru exploration, including treks to Pahalgam. As business is thin, he spends much of his week working in Kargil (at the teashop beside Kacho Guesthouse), so it's worth making contact before turning up in Panikhar.
There are very simple tea-stall shops at Sanku and a summer parachute cafe in Parkachik, but you’d be well advised to bring your own food supplies if planning much Suru exploration.
8 Getting There & Away Government buses to Kargil leave Panikhar around 6.30am and 11am, and Parkachik on alternate days at 7am. Taxis aren’t easily available, and, for Zanskar, onward transport is generally limited to highly uncertain hitch-hiking. Panikhar's Hotel Khayoul can organise vehicles given advanced notice.
Zanskar
Majestically rugged, the greatest attraction of this mountain-hemmed Ladakhi- Buddhist valley is simply getting there, preferably on a trek. While days can be scorching hot, come prepared for cold nights even in summer. Until the Wanla– Photoksar road is extended to Zangla, the only motorable road in is from Kargil into the glorious Suru Valley, then a rough track to isolated Buddhist Rangdum and across the 4401m Pensi La.
Rangdum
Pop 280 / Elev 3670m
Wind-scoured Rangdum makes a handy overnight break on the 12-hour Kargil– Padum jeep ride. The 20 or so low-rise buildings look as though they were dropped randomly onto the remarkably wild, big-sky valley, the meanderingstreams of which are backed to the west by a breathtaking horizon of Patagonian-style jagged peaks. There are several tea-stalls, a homestay and a J&K Tourism Bungalow (d ₹500) with four en-suite rooms, but not necessarily any water or electricity.

Padum
%01983 Pop 1500 Elev 3505m
Zanskar’s dusty little capital has an impressive mountain backdrop, but lacks much architectural character. Within a block of the central crossroads you’ll find the bus/share-taxi stand, phone offices, shops, an unreliable internet cafe, the majority of Padum’s dozen hotel-guesthouses and restaurants plus the helipad on which the carcass of an Indian Army chopper adds interesting foreground to landscape photos.
From the centre, the main road straggles 700m south past a sizeable 1991 mosque to the crumbling little ‘old town’ and a hillock of stupas and water- eroded boulders. Just before, if you fork left, you'll find the road towards Anmu (trekking trailhead). Around 300m further another left turn doubles back past the police station and a few carved Buddha stones. There are more Buddha figures carved into rocks beneath (towards the river – follow the new pathway from the small cemetery).
Around 2km north of Padum is more traditional Pibiting village whose small gompa is dwarfed by a large hilltop stupa topped with a beacon lamp.
2 Activities Zanskar’s top activity is trekking. Although road-building is steadily proceeding, walking remains a popular way to reach the Yapola Valley (north) or Ramjak(south) for connections to Lamayuru/Keylong. Tents and provisions are needed for some sections, and guides and horses can sometimes be organised on the spot. Ask around, at your guesthouse or at agencies along the road to the mosque.
ZANSKAR IN WINTER
In winter, snow cuts Zanskar’s tenuous road links altogether. Yet in late February, Zanskar’s teachers and school kids returning from their winter break manage to walk in from Chiling following an ancient seasonal trade trail that essentially follows the frozen Zanskar River – often on the ice, crossing side streams on precarious snow bridges and camping in caves en route. This hazardous ‘Chadar Trek’ is likely to die out altogether once the Wanla–Zangla road is connected, but till then it attracts a handful of hardy winter hiking-groups every year. Never attempt this alone. While there are no high- altitude stages, you’ll need serious winter kit and an experienced local guide who can ‘read’ the ice. Allow around six days each way.
4 Sleeping & Eating Most hotels close from late October to June, except when pre-booked for winter trekking groups.

HOTEL
At discounted walk-in rates, the Zambala is one of Padum's best deals. OK, so there's no real reception, and cleaning could be more thorough, but sheets are fresh, bathrooms large (bucket hot water) and the guest-only restaurant serves some of Padum's best food…albeit slowly.
Hotel Rigyal

HOTEL
Set back peacefully away from the main market beyond the helipad, Rigyal's new if relatively unsophisticated rooms have very clean bathrooms and views of glacier-topped Ubarak Kangri (behind) or Pibiting (in front). There's a pure-veg restaurant for guests.
8 Getting There & Away Until the Wanla–Padum–Darcha road is finished, transport options will remain very limited, and available in summer only. Every few days a Kargil-bound bus departs Padum at around 3.30am, often continuing to Leh. Afternoon buses run to Karsha and Zangla, returning the next morning.
By jeep, Padum to Kargil costs ₹13,400/2000 per vehicle/seat, but bargaining might be possible with returning Kargil drivers. Alternatively head to Parkachik by jeep (₹11,000), then continue by bus. Other one-way/return rates from Padum: A Karsha ₹1200/1500
A Pidmo Bridge ₹3500/4500 A Rangdum ₹10,500/12,700
North of PadumNorth of Padum
Sani
At Sani, beside the Kargil road, Zanskar’s oldest gompa (Turtot Gyal) is a small, two-storey prayer hall ringed by a tunnelled cloister and a whitewashed stone wall studded with stupas.
Karsha
At the far side of a wide, sun-blasted plain around two hours’ walk from Padum, Karsha Gompa is Zanskar’s largest Buddhist monastery. Dating back to at least the 10th century, it’s a jumble of whitewashed blocks rising almost vertically up a red rock mountain cliff. Concrete steps lead to the monastery’s upper cloister and prayer hall with its cracked old murals and wobbly wooden columns. It’s a great vantage point from which to survey Karsha’s old-fashioned homes, barley fields and threshing circles worked by dzo. Homestay-guesthouses available.
Zangla
For a fine half-day excursion from Padum, drive to Zangla admiring the curled, contorted geological strata that are especially striking above Rinam and Shilingskit villages. A trip highlight is Stongde Gompa crowning a bird’s-eye perch some 300m above the valley, 12km from Padum. The entrance to Zangla is guarded by a small hilltop fortress-palace in which the Hungarian scholar Alexander (Sándor) Csoma de Kőrös took a room while compiling the first Western dictionary of the Tibetan language. At the far end of the village there’s a small, friendly Buddhist nunnery .
South of Padum
The road south from Padum passes Bardan Gompa , spectacularly set on a rocky outcrop high above the river. Ichar (Khor) has a looming monastery of its own and, on slightly higher ground, a small reflective pond and a small knot ofvery evocative old-town. As of 2014 the road ends just beyond Anmu , where a small Amchi-medicine dispensery doubles as a teahouse. From that building a path descends to a very wobbly pedestrian suspension bridge though this might soon be superseded by a road bridge under construction at nearby Tsetang for the new link lane to Surley.
Phuktal
Hanging on a cliff face, Phuktal Gompa (http://phuktalmonastery.com; hprayers at 4:30am, noon & 7pm in summer) appears to be tumbling out of the mouth of a gaping cave. The main hall contains fragments of some 700-year-old murals in the Alchi style, though the tiny upper prayer room feels far more ancient. A road is slowly being built, but for now access is only by a scenically impressive five- hour trek from the trailhead at Anmu. Allow around 2½ attractive-yet- unchallenging hours to reach the large village of Cha (with homestays), then around two hours more to climb gently up and over a shoulder of upland plateau and make the long, steady descent to the river eventually passing (but not crossing) a bridge. Just two minutes later a last short climb brings you to Phuktal's monastery guesthouse (per person ₹200, dinner ₹100). The gompa, visible ahead, is 15 minutes stroll away. If the guesthouse's four basic (yet en-suite) rooms are full, the nearest alternative accommodation involves crossing the bridge and walking 1½ hours to the village of Purney. Each of the three farmsteads offers rooms and camping places and they run two basic shop- teahouses. Directly below lower Purney, where two rivers meet, cross another bridge. Turning left here would take you eventually to Darcha (requires pre- planning – four days, a guide and gear for the 5090m Shingo La). Or turn right to return to Anmu in around three hours via the pretty one-homestead village of Gyalbok (1¼ hours) and the suspension footbridge. Neither Anmu–Phuktal route currently needs a guide if you have hiking experience, but beware that path details may change rapidly due to ongoing road-crew blasting.
THE KASHMIR VALLEY
Rimmed by layers of alpine peaks, the 140km-long Kashmir Valley opens up asa giant, flat upland bowl of lakes and orchards. Tin-roofed villages guard terraced paddy fields delineated by apple groves and pin-straight poplars. Proudly independent-minded Kashmiris mostly follow a Sufi-based Islamic faith, worshipping in distinctive box-shaped mosques with central spires. Some Kashmiris have startlingly green eyes and in winter, Kashmiri men traditionally keep warm by clutching a kangri (wicker fire-pot holder) beneath their flowing grey-brown pheran (woollen capes).
SAFETY IN KASHMIR
Kashmir’s difficult 20th-century history and the delicate relationship between nationalist Muslims and Jammu Hindus creates a cauldron of intercommunal tensions contained or exacerbated (according to one’s viewpoint) by a very visible Indian army presence. When things are calm, Kashmir is probably safer than most places in India. But cycles of unrest, stone-throwing and curfews can erupt remarkably rapidly. At such times the Old City is worth avoiding but Dal Lake generally remains trouble-free even during fairly significant disturbances: foreign tourists have never been targets. Use common sense, avoid public demonstrations and military installations, and consult a wide range of resources to get a feel of the situation before arriving. Useful starting points include the forum of India Mike (www.indiamike.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir-f30) and local news feeds including Kashmir Times (www.kashmirtimes.com), Greater Kashmir (www.greaterkashmir.com), Kashmir Monitor (www.kashmirmonitor.in) and Daily Excelsior (www.dailyexcelsior.com).
History Geologists and Hindu mystics agree that the Kashmir Valley was once a vast lake. Where they disagree is whether it was drained by a post–ice age earthquake or by Lord Vishnu and friends as a ploy to kill a water demon.
In the 3rd century BC the Hindu kingdom of Kashmir became a major centre of Buddhist learning under Emperor Ashoka. In the 13th and 14th centuries, Islam arrived through the inspiration of peaceable Sufi mystics. Later some Muslim rulers, such as Sultan Sikandar ‘Butshikan’ (r 1389–1413), set about the destruction of Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries. However, others such as the great Zain-ul-Abidin (r 1423–74) encouraged such religious and cultural tolerance that medieval visitors reported finding it hard to tell Hindus and Muslims apart. Mughal emperors, including Akbar (1556–1605), whose troops took Kashmir in 1586, saw Kashmir as their Xanadu and developed a series of,
extravagant gardens around Srinagar.
p
When the British arrived in India, Jammu and Kashmir were a loose affiliation of independent kingdoms, nominally controlled by the Sikh rulers of Jammu. In 1846, after the British had defeated the Sikhs, they handed Kashmir to Maharaja Gulab Singh in return for a yearly tribute of six shawls, 12 goats and a horse. Singh’s autocratic Hindu-Dogra dynasty ruled until Independence, showing an infamous disregard for the welfare of the Muslim majority.
Partition & Conflict
As Partition approached in 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh favoured Kashmiri independence rather than joining either India or Pakistan, but he failed to make a definitive decision. Finally, to force the issue, Pashtun tribesmen, backed by the new government in Pakistan, attempted to grab the state by force, setting off the first India–Pakistan war. The invaders were pushed out of the Kashmir Valley but Pakistan retained control of Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and the valley’s main access routes. Kashmir has remained divided ever since along a tenuous UN- demarcated border, known as the Line of Control. A proposed referendum to let Kashmir’s people decide (for Pakistan or India) never materialised and Pakistan invaded again in 1965, triggering another protracted conflict.
In the 1970s, a generation of visitors rediscovered Indian Kashmir as an idyllic summer getaway. But armed rebellion became intense during the later 1980s and Kashmir was placed under direct rule from Delhi in 1990. For several bloody years massacres and bomb attacks were countered by brutal counter- insurgency tactics from the Indian armed forces. Significant human-rights abuses were reported on both sides.
After the brief India–Pakistan ‘Kargil War’ of 1999, a ceasefire and increasing autonomy for Kashmir was matched by a significant reduction in tensions. Coordinating relief after a tragic 2005 earthquake also helped bring the Indian and Pakistani governments a little closer. Militant attacks dwindled and domestic tourism blossomed anew despite disturbances in 2008 (over an arcane land dispute at Amarnath) and 2010 (after the shooting of juvenile stone-throwers). In 2014, a uniquely wet summer caused unprecedented flooding in Srinagar.Srinagar

Indulgent houseboats, historic gardens, distinctive Kashmiri wooden mosques and a mild summer climate combine to make Srinagar one of India’s top domestic tourist attractions. Except, that is, when intercommunal tensions paralyse the city with strikes and shut-downs. Srinagar’s three main areas converge around Dalgate, where the southwestern nose of Dal Lake passes through a lock gate. Northwest lies the fascinatingly chaotic Old City. The busy commercial centre is southwest around Lal Chowk. The city’s greatest drawcard is mesmerisingly placid Dal Lake, which stretches a southwestern channel-spur towards the city centre, paralleled by the hotel-lined Boulevard. A bright array of houseboats here form a particularly colourful scene. The famous Mughal gardens are strung out over several kilometres around the lake.
In 2014, the city was hit by devastating floods as the Jhelum River surged over its banks; repairs are ongoing but more floods were reported in 2015 so check the latest situation before you visit.Srinagar1 Top Sights 1Dal LakeD2

Dal Lake & Around
Whether you sleep on one of its wonderful time-warp houseboats or just stroll along the Boulevard savouring the sunset, beautifully serene Dal Lake ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ) is likely to be your main memory of Srinagar. Mirror-flat waters
beautifully reflect the misty peaks of the Pir Panjal mountains while gaily painted shikaras (colourful gondolas) glide by. These are gondola-like boats, hand-powered with heart-shaped paddles used to transport goods to market, children to school, and visitors on explorative tours of the lake’s floating communities. Canal-like passages link all the way to Nagin Lake. The gardens supplying the lake's floating vegetable market (h5-6.30am) were affected byflooding in 2014; if the market resumes, expect approaches from shikara operators offering dawn tours. Alternatively, just watch veg-boats unloading by
day at Mirzabagh (

Much of Dal Lake is thick with foliage, lotus patches and large areas of cultivated vegetable gardens linked by channels and served by villages of stilted walkways. Assuming that 2014 flood damage is repaired, a great way to see these areas is by walking along Chowdary Bagh. Eventually you'll reach a footbridge and causeway leading to the pumping station near Nishat Bagh Mughal Garden, though the last 3km (after Nandpora) can be muddy and is uncomfortably rough for bicycles.
Shankaracharya Hill

 ; h7am-5.30pm)
Thickly forested Shankaracharya Hill is topped by a small Shiva temple,
Shankaracharya Mandir ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), built from hefty blocks of
visibly ancient grey stone. Previously known as Takht-i-Sulaiman (Throne of Solomon), it’s now named for a sage who reached enlightenment here in AD 750, but signs date the octagonal structure as 5th century and the site is even older.
Some claim, controversially, that a previous temple here was once renovated by Jesus and St Thomas. Access is by a winding 5.5km road from Nehru Park (₹300 return by autorickshaw). From road’s end the temple is five minutes up a stairway from a police checkpoint where you must leave phones and cameras before reaching the panoramic views of Srinagar and Dal Lake.
Mughal Gardens
 
Srinagar’s famous gardens date back to the Mughal era. Most have a
GARDENSfundamentally similar design with terraced lawns, fountain pools and carefully manicured flowerbeds interspersed with mighty chinar trees, pavilions and mock
fortress facades. The most famous garden is Shalimar Bagh ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ;
adult/child ₹10/5; h10am-7pm), 10km beyond Nehru Park, built for Nur Jahan by her
husband Jehangir. However, Nishat Bagh (

 ; adult/child ₹10/5;
h9am-dusk) is more immediately impressive, with steeper terracing and a lake- facing panorama (7.5km from Nehru Park).
Pari Mahal ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; adult/child ₹10/5; h9am-7.30pm) is set amid palace
ruins high above the lakeshore (about 9km from Nehru Park). The ensemble looks most intriguing viewed from afar when floodlit at night. By day, the long, steep autorickshaw ride is worthwhile more for the lake views than for the gardens themselves. Bring ID for police checks. En route you’ll pass the petite
Cheshmashahi Garden (adult/child ₹10/5; h8.30am-7.30pm) and the extensive,
less formal Botanical Garden (

Backing onto Dal Lake several kilometres north of the Old City, this large, white-domed 20th-century mosque enshrines Kashmir’s holiest Islamic relic, the Moi-e-Muqqadas, supposedly a beard hair of the Prophet Mohammed. The hair’s brief disappearance in December 1963 nearly sparked a civil war. Visitors are admitted outside of prayer times.

When visiting mosques, follow normal Islamic formalities (dress modestly, remove shoes) and ask permission before entering or taking interior photos. Women will usually be expected to cover their hair and use a separate entrance.

It was constructed without using any nails and both frontage and interiors are covered in papier-mâché reliefs and elaborately coloured khatamband (faceted wood panelling). Non-Muslim visitors can peek through the door but may not enter.
The building stands on the site of one of Kashmir’s first mosques, founded by Persian saint Mir Sayed Ali Hamadani, who arrived in 1372, one of 700 refugees fleeing Timur’s conquest of Iran. He is said to have converted 37,000 people to Sufi-based Islam, and it’s likely that his retinue introduced Kashmiris to the Persian art of fine carpet-making.

Unlike most typical Kashmiri spired mosques, Pather Masjid is a heavy Mughal structure built by Nur Jahan in 1623. The road-facing side is partly hidden by shop-units, but behind, a triple-rank of nine arches opens onto a walled, four-tree chinar garden.
It's worth following the lane directly south, walking beneath the razor-wired guard post to the riverside for views across to Khanqah Shah-i-Hamadan.

Looking more Bulgarian than Kashmiri, the multi-domed 15th-century brick tomb of King Zeinalabdin’s mum was built on the plinth of a much older former Buddhist temple. It’s within an ancient graveyard hidden in Gadu Bazaar's maze of copperware, spice and cloth vendors’ shops. A number of graves were washed away during the 2014 floods, but work is underway to restore the compound. To view the interior, you will need to find the caretaker; ask at the shops in front of the cemetery.
The tomb’s domes form part of the classic view of Old Town Srinagar as viewed looking north from the new Zaina Kadal (bridge), with the city’s oldest wooden bridge as foreground.Jama Masjid

At the north end of the triangular patch of grass in front of the Sufi shrine of Pir
Dastgir Sahib ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h5.30am-7.30pm) is a small, green shrine
known as Rozabal. A highly controversial theory claims that the shrine’s crypt holds the grave of Jesus Christ. Tourists are actively discouraged from approaching, but the mere existence of this little place poses some intriguing questions.
JESUS IN KASHMIR?
To many, the theory sounds crackpot or even blasphemous, but several authors have claimed that Jesus spent his ‘lost years’ (between his youth and the start of his ministry aged 30) in India where Buddhism moulded his ideas. This theory gained a lot of publicity in the 1890s when Russian traveller/spy Nicolas Notovitch ‘discovered’ supposedly corroborating documents at Hemis Gompa (Ladakh), described in his book Unknown Life of Jesus Christ. These Hemis documents have since gone missing.
The Koran (surah 4, verses 156–157) states that Jesus’ death on the cross was a ‘grievous calumny’ and that ‘they slew him not’. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad’s Jesus in Heaven & Earth further postulates that Jesus (as Isa, Yuz Asaf or Youza Asouph) retired to Kashmir post-crucifixion and was buried in Srinagar. Holger Kersten’s Jesus Lived inIndia, widely sold in Indian traveller bookshops, argues the case carefully and even gives a floor plan of the Rozabal. The roughly four-million-strong Ahmadiyya sect (who consider themselves Muslim, but are not recognised by other branches of the faith) also subscribe to the idea of Jesus dying in Kashmir. See www.alislam.org/topics/jesus.
Hari Parbat Hill
North of centre but visible from virtually anywhere in Srinagar, this prominent hilltop was once an island in a giant lake where, Hindus believe, Vishnu and Sharika (Durga) defeated Jalodbhava, Kashmir’s mythical demon. The imposing
Hari Parbat Fort (Koh-e-Maran Fort; 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; permission note ₹100; h10am-
3pm Sat-Thur) that now crowns the hill, mostly dates from 1808, built by Pathan governor Atta Mohammad Khan, though remnants of 6th-century fortifications have been found. The fort remains a minor military base but reopened to tourists in July 2014. Before going you'll need a stamped permissory note from the TRC (passport copy and ₹100 required for application). Entrance is from the northeast side, via a traffic-free lane starting north of Badamvaer (Badanwari;
adult/child ₹10/5; h8am-8.30pm), orchard gardens, the most interesting feature of
which is the antique well-house. The fort access lane starts with a checkpoint, then a sweaty 10-minute walk using fairly obvious short cuts brings you to a second sign-in, 15 minutes' walk to the fort's uppermost tower.
More easily accessible on the hill's southern mid-slopes, but also offering fine views, are the extensive ruins of the 1649 Akhund Mulla Shah Mosque (

On the western flank of Hari Parbat is Sri Sharika (Chakreshwar;

Although damaged by the 2014 floods, this historic factory still churns out bolts of silk on old-fashioned weaving machines, much as it has done since 1938. Ask permission at the 'time gate' or, at the government emporium in front.
2 Activities The alpine lakes, meadows and uplands of Kashmir offer some stunning hiking opportunities, but unlike in Ladakh, it can be hard to find fellow walkers to join a group. Virtually every houseboat owner will have a 'brother' who can take you, and there are ever more online sites offering trek packages, but you may be able to get abetter deal simply by heading to Naranag and organising things for yourself. If you are planning to do that, you might be advised to rent camping equipment from the Mountaineering Information Office, beside Srinagar TRC, as supplies in Naranag are in short supply.
4 Sleeping Staying on a houseboat is one of the city’s main attractions, but when first arriving you might prefer to sleep at least the first night or two in a hotel while carefully selecting a suitable boat. Budget options are relatively limited (try Dalgate or Old Gagribal Rd). There are midrange hotels in profusion, but many are unkempt and rely primarily on noisy, self-catering groups of domestic tourists, especially from April to June and in October. Note that many hotels were affected by the 2014 floods – ask to see a few rooms before making a decision.

HOUSEBOATS
Srinagar’s signature houseboats first appeared in colonial times because the British were prohibited from owning land. The best deluxe boats are palatial, with chandeliers, carved walnut panels, ceilings of khatamband (faceted wood panelling) and chintzy sitting rooms redolent of the 1930s Raj era. Category A boats are comfy but less grand. Lower categories (C, D) might lack interior sitting areas.
Be aware that the Srinagar houseboat experience is like staying in a small, romantic guesthouse complete with cook and waiter. Unlike in Kerala, these boats never move, and most are moored in sizeable groups. A colourful attraction is watching comings and goings, but don't expect quiet seclusion.
Better houseboats typically have three or four en-suite double bedrooms. When things are busy, the best rooms (usually at the back of deluxe boats) may be booked out well in advance. But off season, or when the political climate drives tourists away, you’re likely to get the whole boat to yourself, chef and all.
Choosing from 1400 boats is challenging. Some owners are super-friendly families, others are crooks – ask fellow travellers for recent first-hand recommendations. Outside peak season (April to June), it's best to check out a selection and pick one that suits rather than pre-booking.
HOUSEBOAT TIPS
For most visitors, staying on a houseboat is a relaxing Srinagar highlight. But a few have reported feeling cheated, being held virtual hostage or suffering inappropriate advancesepo ted  ee    g c  eated, be   g   e d v  tua    ostage o  su  e    g    app op  ate adva  ces from houseboat staff. Some tips:
Beware of houseboat packages and never book in Delhi.
Check out houseboats in person or via trusted websites before agreeing to anything. Get a clear, possibly written, agreement stating what the fees cover (tea, drinking water, shikara transfer, canoe usage, second helpings at dinner?).
Check whether the boat really is the category that the owner claims (certificates should be posted) or risk paying deluxe prices for a B-grade boat!
Don’t be pressured into giving ‘charity’ donations or signing up for overpriced treks. Don’t leave valuables unattended: boat-borne thieves can be fast.
Don’t leave your passport with the boat owner. Tell a friend or trusted hotelier where you’re staying. Trust your instincts.
CHOOSING THE AREA
Major choices:
Dal First Row (

 ) Facing the Boulevard, easy to-and-fro by
shikara, but busy and noisy in season. Dal Second Row (Golden Dal Lake; 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ) Though only slightly further
back, boats here are invisible from the Boulevard and generally better placed for sunset views. Plenty of colourful bustle, and it costs less than ₹100 to reach by shikara from
ghats 9 or 12. Our favourite is Young Beauty Star (

ranging from ₹600/900 (category D) to ₹3150/4800 (deluxe) for a double room including half-board. In reality, however, that's merely a guide. Some places openly ask for more, others will ask only a fraction of that when occupancy is low.

KASHMIRI FOODKashmir has a distinct cuisine all of its own. A full traditional wazwan (feast) can have dozens of courses, notably goshtaba (pounded mutton balls in saffron-yoghurt curry), tabak maaz (fried lamb’s ribs) and rogan josh (rich, vividly red-coloured mutton curry). Kashmiri chefs also serve deliciously aromatic cheese-based curries and seasonal nadir (lotus stems), typically served in yakhni (a curd-based sauce made mildly minty with fennel). Kashmiri kahwa is a luxurious golden tea, flavoured with saffron, cinnamon and crushed almonds.
6 Drinking Srinagar’s Muslim mores mean that alcohol isn’t served in restaurants, the few wine shops (

7 Shopping The Boulevard has several emporia flogging Kashmiri souvenirs, including elegantly painted papier- mâché boxes and carved walnut woodwork, plus cashmere and pashmina shawls, originally popularised in Europe by Napoleon’s wife Josephine. Chain-stitched gabbas (Kashmiri rugs with appliqué), crewel embroidery work or floral namdas (felted wool carpets) also make good souvenirs. Saffron, cricket bats and dried fruits are widely sold around Lal Chowk.

AIRA Arrival Foreigners must fill a J&K arrival form, which demands you give the name of your hotel. If you don't know, write TRC (Tourist Reception Centre). A Departure Srinagar’s airport is 1.2km behind a security barrier where there can be long queues for baggage and body screening. You’ll need to show an air ticket (or e-ticket confirmation print-out) to get through so don’t come to the airport hoping to buy a ticket on departure. Allow at least two hours' leeway.

Kishtwar you'll have to stay overnight in Vailoo or nearby Kokernag as Kishtwar shared jeeps (₹300/3500 per person/vehicle, six hours) all depart from Vailoo between 6am and 10am.
A Jammu Private buses (mostly overnight) start from Panthachowk bus station, 8km south of centre. There are also rickety J&KSRTC buses (class B/A/18- seater bus ₹300/420/510, 10 to 13 hours) at 6.30am, 7.30am and (some evenings) 7.30pm from the far more convenient J&KSRTC bus station (

GOOGLE MAP
 ; %0194-2455107). Or take a shared jeep (₹700/4950 per
person/vehicle) from across the road with departures all morning but easiest from 6.30am to 9am. The well-paved Srinagar–Jammu road has many scenic points and snow is cleared year-round, but jams are common following landslides and hartals (strikes). Be prepared to fly at such times.
A Kargil Shared jeeps (₹900/6400 per person/car) depart before 9am from
Tourist Taxi Stand 1 (

 ; Residency Rd) and from Kaksarai
near SMHS hospital in Karan Nagar (western Srinagar) from which there arealso two private buses around 5am (₹400).
A Leh J&KSRTC has a 7am bus (class B/A ₹1060/1600, two days, book one day ahead) that stops the night en route in Kargil. From Tourist Taxi Stand 1 shared jeeps (₹2100 per person, 14 hours) mostly leave before 7am. Book at least a day ahead to score good seats.
A Delhi J&KSRTC 7.30am (seat/sleeper ₹1490/1670, around 24 hours).
J&KSRTC also advertises excursion buses to Sonamarg (one-way/return ₹180/289), Gulmarg (₹179/271) and Pahalgam (₹180/289) and other tourist destinations, all departing between 7.30am and 9am, but lack of customers means that few actually run outside the peak May to June period. Before paying the ticket, ask fellow passengers whether they might prefer to share a sumo from the taxi stand opposite.
The giant Batmalu bus station, west of centre, has services thrice daily to Sonamarg and frequent sumos to Tangmarg for Gulmarg.
JEEP HIRE
Dozens of stands offer jeep rental. Return prices include Pahalgam (₹2950), Sonamarg (₹2850) and Gulmarg (₹2050). Your hotel might offer better deals.
TRAIN
The nearest train station is at Nowgam, around 10km south of the Old City. Trains currently run Banihal–Qazigund–Anantnag–Nowgam–Baramulla but by 2018 the whole Jammu–Katra–Nowgam–Baramulla line should be complete. Well maybe.
8 Getting Around Autorickshaws cost ₹50 for short hops, and around ₹200 per hour for tours.
Shikaras are colourful gondolas propelled by a heart-shaped paddles. Officially they charge ₹50 for the shortest houseboat-to-shore hops or ₹500 per hour. In reality some shikara-wallahs accept as little as ₹200 per hour (notably
from Khona Khon New Rd ( pressure.

Overcrowded minibuses ply the main routes including Lal Chowk–Hazratbal and Lal Chowk–Shalimar Bagh via Dal Lake’s south bank.If you can handle the manic traffic, a bicycle offers a liberating way to go sightseeing in the sprawling but relatively flat old city and lakeshore areas. Bike- rental opportunites are limited but a few are available (usually for guests only) from Hotel Swiss, Comrade Inn and Noor Guest House (₹250 per day).
AIRPORT TRANSPORT
A J&KSRTC bus (₹70) supposedly meets most flights then runs to Lal Chowk, with tickets sold in the terminal. Last service before 4pm. Pre-paid taxis are listed as costing ₹445/525 to cental Srinagar/Nehru Park but 'with extras' you'll actually pay ₹600. From the outside taxi counter, locals share rides paying ₹100 per seat to Lal Chowk in central Srinagar, but drivers seem extremely reluctant to take foreigners.
Around Srinagar
Sonamarg, set amid spectacular mountains, can be visited between Leh and Srinagar and in mid-summer is linked to tiny but historic Naranag by a multiday trek through some spectacular lake-dappled alpine highlands. Gulmarg is great for extreme skiing in winter but in summer its cable car is often overloaded by queues of Indian tourists waiting for hours on end. Overcrowding is also a curse in once-lovely Pahalgam but canny foreigners zip swiftly on from there up to tiny Aru with its tremendous alpine backdrop and instant hiking appeal. While it's not a destination in itself, Anantnag (Islamabad), along with twin-town Khanabal, 4km away on the main Jammu–Srinagar highway, makes a useful transit point if diverting to Pahalgam or to Kishtwar via the lovely Kokernag Botanical Gardens and the countless hairpins of Sinthan Top. If you're driving Srinagar–Anantnag, you'll pass saffron-producers at Pampore , cricket-bat makers at Sangam and two ancient temple ruins at the roadside in Awantipora . If those appeal, then consider an 8km diversion from Khanabal to Mattan, 2.5km above which ruins of an 8th-century sun temple (hdawn-dusk) are set in splendidly tended grounds (follow signs to Kehrbal).
Naranag & Lake GangabalHome to seminomadic Gujar people, and a pair of remarkable unfenced 8th- century Shiva temple ruins (Naranag), little Naranag sits in a deep-cut river valley thick with mature conifer forests. It is mostly used by visitors as a trailhead for multiday treks in Kashmir's 'Great Lakes' uplands.
A major highlight is beautiful Lake Gangabal, which could be accessed in around seven strenuous hours' hike from Naranag village steeply following the last cascading side stream before the temple ruins. You'll gain around 1200m elevation so take things slowly! It's possible to continue in around five days to Sonamarg (or vice versa) but certain passes can be impassably snowy till late July and permits are required on certain routes (apply through Srinagar TRC or Manigal camp near Kangan). Prospective guides will likely find you on arrival in Naranag and will happily arrange packhorses, but standards of English aren't great and pricing can be very sketchy. Most local guides have tents and sleeping bags but bringing your own would be very wise (rentable from Srinagar TRC). The advertised J&KSRTC tourist bus Srinagar–Naranag is essentially fictional due to lack of custom.
Naranag has at least eight scruffy homestay-guesthouses, most in a deplorable state of disarray. Upstairs rooms at Khan Guesthouse (%9697559256; d without bathroom ₹500) are cleaner than most. Ashraf Jagil's Homestay (r ₹500), directly above the temple ruins, has ultra-basic floor-space accommodation sleeping up to eight people per bare room for ₹500 total (bring a sleeping bag). Scarlet-and- mustard New Pine Palace (%7296309503, 9797121636; d ₹700-1000) has an attractive restaurant section, but en-suite rooms are unkempt. At the start of town, four- room Gulshan Lodge (%9858375734; r ₹500-1000) has balconies on two of its functional en-suite rooms.
A charter jeep from Srinagar costs ₹2400. The one daily bus service leaves at 8am for Kangan (₹20, 80 minutes) returning at 3pm. Kangan–Srinagar shared sumos (₹70, one hour) run to Lal Chowk, plus there are buses to Batmalu bus station.
Sonamarg
%0194 Pop 800 (summer only) Elev 2800mSurrounded by soaring sharpened peaks and Sound of Music scenery, Sonamarg (Km85) is a strip-town marring an otherwise gorgeous alpine valley. Sitting astride the Kargil–Srinagar road, it makes a possible trekking base or a meal- stop before/after crossing the nerve-jangling 3529m Zoji La (hoften closed for maintenance 11am-3pm Mon-Sat) pass. It's also a staging point for yatra-hike pilgrims en route to Amarnath’s holy ice lingam via Baltal Camp, a summer-only mayhem of tents around 15km east.
An easy way to savour the spectacular scenery is by walking up the parallel valley to the fingertips of Thajiwas Glacier. Walking takes around an hour starting along the track between the Hotel Glacier Heights and the Army camp through a zone of newly developing buiildings then curling left around the forest ridge. A more obvious (and far busier) route starts from around Km83, where you could alternatively engage small horses (₹500, only slightly faster) or take a taxi roughly halfway (₹800 return, private cars not permitted).
4 Sleeping & Eating In central Sonamarg, facing the sumo stand and tourist office, is a scrappy strip of mostly jerry-built box restaurants and souvenir shops above which small, poorly maintained guest rooms typically cost ₹2000 to ₹4000 in high season (May to June) but only ₹1000 or so by September. Hotel Sonamarg (%9419448827; ₹1200-2500) is currently the best of this dreary lot.
Stretching west to Km83, a building frenzy is filling once-pristine upland sheep-meadows with cheek-by-jowl new hotels. We counted 17 construction sites. At the far end of this strip, longer-established Hotel Snowland (%0194-
2417262; Srinagar-Kargil Rd Km83; rack-rate r ₹6000-12,000, off-peak from ₹4000; hMay-Oct; W) has
grown into a veritable estate of nine comfortable sub-hotels.
Around 20 minutes' walk from Km83 towards Thajiwas Glacier, an aging green wooden building is home to Sonamarg's cheapest and most peaceful option, the misnamed J&K Tourist Dormitories (%Mr Hidayat 9469413011;
dm/cottage ₹200/7000), with its basic old twin rooms around a central courtyard that you can pre-book at the J&KTRC office in central Sonamarg.Sitting alone between the river and main road, 2km east of Sonamarg, the half-timbered International Youth Hostel (%9419707307; iyhssonmarg@gmail.com;
Srinagar-Kargil Rd Km86.3; dm/q ₹550/2400) has giant, super-airy dorms are often mostly
empty even in season. Facilities include snooker, table-tennis and a well- equipped weight-training gym. There's a campsite 600m further upstream and beyond near Km87 you'll find a boating pond with zorbing cylinders and a rafting point.
There are a dozen more hotels in Gagangir (Km74), which has a cramped feel but a spectacular setting.
8 Getting There & Away A Srinagar Buses (₹120, over five hours) depart 7am, 9am, 11am, 2pm and 4pm. Locals prefer a shared sumo to Kangan (₹80, 90 minutes) and another from there to Srinagar
(₹70, one hour).
A Kargil Chartered jeeps want ₹5000. Kargil-/Leh-bound buses pass through at around 8am/10.30am respectively, but are often full on arrival. So too are most shared jeeps ex-Srinagar but it's worth looking for 07 number plates stopped at the restaurant strip or bus stand. If you find a seat, the charge should be ₹600 per person to Kargil. An alternative is to have a friendly hotelier phone-reserve a seat in a jeep ex-Srinagar. Give him the fare (₹1000 per seat) as a deposit as reassurance that you won't make alternative arrangements.
AMARNATH
Amarnath's unique attraction is a natural stone lingam that becomes opalescent when encrusted with ice and is believed to wax and wane with the phases of the moon. Seen as symbolising Lord Shiva, it's hidden in an isolated mountain cave at 3888m, 14km from the nearest road. Joining the summer-only yatra (Hindu pilgrimage) is an unforgettable experience and the two possible routes are both very beautiful, but it’s certainly not a meditative country hike. After all there are around 20,000 fellow pilgrims on the trail every day. Both blizzards and Kashmiri militants have killed pilgrims in the past so prospective yatri (pilgrim-hikers) need to be suitably equipped and must apply for a special permit that requires five photos, a medical check (at Srinagar public hospital), approved insurance, passport copy and ₹150, which should all be presented at the TRC Office in Nowgam, 12km outside Srinagar. See www.shriamarnathjishrine.com for more detail.From the vast Baltal Camp 15km east of Sonamarg, Amarnath is just 14km away. Wealthier pilgrims complete that journey by pony, helicopter or dandy (palanquin). The longer approach starts with a 16km taxi ride from Pahalgam to Chandanwari (₹700), then a 36km, three-day hike. Either way, camps en route provide all essentials, so you don't need to carry much more than spare warm clothes.

For Indian tourists, Gulmarg's double-shot Gondola (www.gulmarggondola.com; cable
car 1/2 stages in summer ₹600/1400, 1-day ski pass 1/2 stages for foreigners ₹1000/1600, locals
₹600/1000; h9am-3pm, last return around 5pm) is a great summer attraction. Foreigners
who have seen mountaintops and snow before might think otherwise due to gruelling queues at the cable car and the somewhat half-hearted nature of local donkey treks once you reach the top. Mid-December to mid-March everything changes. In winter Gulmarg comes into its own as a ski centre, famed for its perfect high-altitude powder. Although a chairlift partially paralleling the gondola's second stage does offer easier alternatives, this is really a venue for extreme skiers. The basin enfolding the gondola is patrolled and blasted for avalanche prevention, but the vast majority of other couloirs and forest tracks are unsecured so it’s essential to be snow-savvy and to check conditions carefully. Gulmarg Avalanche (http://gulmargavalanche.org) gives detailed updates
throughout the season. GM Ahanger (%9596295371, 9697767268; ahangergm@gmail.com)
has been recommended as a ski-guide and several outlets rent decent gear. Swiss
FSH (Free Ski Himalaya; www.freeskihimalaya.com) and Australia-based Bills Trips
(www.billstrips.com) offer complete ski packages.
Gulmarg is only 1½ hour's drive from Srinagar, but stay overnight to get a head start onto the pistes. Modest but switched-on Raja's Hut (%9797297908;
dadakhan53@yahoo.com; d/half-board ₹2500/2800) is run by a genial snowboarder and is
favoured by many budget-minded international adventure folk. Other decent choices include the cheery if slightly worn, pine-decor Heevan Retreat
(%01954-254455; www.ahadhotelsandresorts.com; s/d/ste ₹7500/8500/11,000, breakfast/dinner buffet ₹500/850; W), plain family-style Shaw Inn (%01954-254532, 9596972200;
www.shawinn.in; s/d ₹7000/7500) or the dauntingly suave palace-hotel Khyber Himalayan (%01954-254666; http://khyberhotels.com; d ₹12,500-23,000, cottage ₹50,000-75,000; W).
8 Getting There & Away A day-return jeep hire from Srinagar costs ₹2085 per vehicle. Alternatively, from Srinagar’s Batmalu bus station take shared jeeps to Tangmarg (₹70) then change for the last 13km of hairpins to Gulmarg (₹30).
In summer a barrier is closed beside the jeep-stand forcing you to walk the last 15 minutes to the gondola, or to fall prey to cheeky horsemen who exaggeratedly claim it's 3km and want ₹150 for the trot.
Pahalgam & Aru
%01936 Pop 6000 Elev 2400-2750m
Surrounded by alpine peaks, the Lidder and Seshnag rivers tumble down picturesque, deep-cut mountain valleys covered with giant conifers. The surrounding mountains contain many beauty spots and over 20 lakes to which countless guides and horsemen are more than keen to take you for a ride.
Not quite spoiling the great natural beauty is Pahalgam, a major resort town and staging point for the Amarnath pilgrimage. Sprawling 4km around the river junction, it offers golf, rafting and over 230 hotels ranging from vaguely
Scandinavian-styled Himalaya House (%01936-243072; www.himalayahouse.in; standard/deluxe ₹3000/4900; W) and fashion-conscious Pine Spring (%01936-243386; www.hotelpinespring.com; Laripora Rd; s/d/ste ₹7000/9000/11,000) to old-fashioned chocolate- box cottage-style Alpine Inn (%9906756030, 01936-243065; www.alpineinnpahalgam.com;
Heevan Link Rd; d ₹3200-4500) and the basic but peacefully secluded Ramba Palace
(Bentes Lodge; %01936-243296, 9419745142, 9419727379; rambapalace@yahoo.com; Mamal; d ₹500-
1000, without bathroom ₹400-600), an aging budget place with breathtaking views (ask at the co-owned Palestine Hotel facing the main sumo station and you'll probably be given a free transfer as it's somewhat hard to find).
Almost any hotel is likely to urge you to try a donkey hike or full-blown trek. The best hiking often starts 12km away in Aru, a tiny village set beautifully amid the foothill peaks. In the last couple of years, foreign budget travellers havestarted blowing straight through over-crowded Pahalgam to stay in one of Aru's half-dozen basic accommodation options including welcoming Friends
Guesthouse (%01936-210928; www.friendsguesthousepahalgam.com; Aru; d ₹300-500 ) and
Rohella Guesthouse (%01936-211339, 9622761355; www.rohella.brinkster.net; Aru; s/d
₹500/600; hApr-Oct), a firm favourite with the dreadlock crowd. Milky Way
Hotel (%01936-210899, 9419435832; www.milkywaykashmir.com; Aru; r ₹2500-3200, without
bathroom ₹800) is a slight cut above with en-suite bathrooms and an OK restaurant. Though Aru hibernates from November to March, in summer it's an easy place to find guides and horses or to simply wander off by yourself into magical upland landscapes.
8 Getting There & Away Sometimes-cancelled J&KSRTC buses run to Srinagar (₹180 to ₹260, 4.30pm) and Jammu (₹270, 7.30am). A better idea is heading first to Anantnag by shared jeep (₹80, one hour) or by rare local buses (₹42, 1½ hours). The only vehicles permitted to go to Aru (from ₹600) and Chandawari (₹700, 19km) start from the Tourist Taxi Stand (%01936-243126; www.taxistandpahalgam.com), 10 minutes' walk up the main road from the sumo station.
SOUTHERN JAMMU & KASHMIR
The state’s predominantly Hindu southern region swelters at the edge of the plains. Floods of yatri (pilgrims) arrive en route to Katra (April to June and October to December) and Amarnath (July), but foreign visitors are rare.
Jammu
%0191 Pop 504,000 Elev 327m
Jammu is the state's winter capital and pre-Independence was once the seat of J&K's Dogra dynasty. Religiously Hindu, Jammu dubs itself as the ‘city of temples’. Few of these temples are historically compulsive, and for foreign tourists there’s little pressing need to hang around longer than necessary to make transport connections to Amritsar, Srinagar or Dharamsala.But if you've time to kill, consider one of the set three-to four-hour sightseeing circuits offered by certain autorickshaw drivers (₹350 to ₹500). These usually
include the tall towered Ranbireshwar Mandir (

In the 20th century the Marharajas moved from Mubarak Mahal, further up the ridge to this very European brick mansion complete with token castle-style tower. An interesting museum-like interior introduces the characters who once lived here and with the 'special' ticket you'll be escorted upstairs to peruse the Maharani's chambers with Queen Victoria portrait and bathroom complete with perfume collection. Before leaving, peep through the front curved verandah window to see the raja’s canopied throne made from 101kg of gold.
Then, perhaps, retire for a cocktail at the refreshingly air-conditioned Polo Lounge bar of the Hari Niwas Palace Hotel that shares the same manicured cliff- top lawns.

A Katra Buses, minibuses and taxis depart very regularly from both bus and train stations.
A Kishtwar Nine buses (₹260, seven hours) depart between 2am and 9.10am. A Manali Private bus at 8.30pm (₹750, 11 hours) from Krishna & Ashish Travel (bus station unit 13A).
A Srinagar Ever-changing situation. Target journey time is 12 hours but traffic jams can extend that considerably. J&KSRTC buses should leave at 5am,
6.30am and 7am; there's a KMD basic bus at 8pm (₹400); and several private agencies have 10pm overnight departures including Sahiba and Luxmi
(seat/sleeper ₹500/700). Chartered Indica/Qualis vehicles holding three/six passengers charge ₹5500/6500 one way. Drivers offering shared rides (from ₹600 to ₹800 depending on occupancy) gather along the bus station ramp and near Jewel Chowk but while quicker than buses, departure times are highly uncertain.
TRAIN
Jammu Tawi, Jammu’s main train station, is well south of the river, 5km from the bus station.

Slower but somewhat cheaper, the Jhelum Express (11078, departing 9.45pm) gives two hours more sleep and continues to Agra (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹395/1060/1535) arriving 1.50pm.
The new northbound railway now extends to Katra and should reach Srinagar around 2018, crossing the Chenab River on the world’s tallest rail bridge.
8 Getting Around To the airport from Jewel Chowk, autorickshaws/taxis cost around ₹175/300, or use ‘Satwari’-bound minibuses. From the airport, turn left on exiting the grounds to find local taxis waiting at Durga Filling Station.

Accessed by foot, palanquin or helicopter from nearby Katra, the latter-day Vaishno Devi Shrine (www.maavaishnodevi.org) is one of India’s busiest pilgrim sites. It attracts millions of domestic visitors, but its appeal is hard to understand for most non-Hindus.
Southwest of Udhampur, the restored historic palace at Ramnagar is attractive, but hardly justifies the long journey. Be aware that Ramnagar's train station is around 30km from Ramnagar itself.

Himachal PradeshWhy Go?
With spectacular snowy peaks and plunging river valleys, Himachal is India’s outdoor adventure playground. From trekking and climbing to rafting, paragliding and skiing, if it can be done in the mountains, it can be done here. A convoluted topography of interlocking mountain chains also makes Himachal a spectacular place simply to explore, by bus, car, motorbike or jeep safari. Every pass crossing into a new valley brings you into a different world, with its own customs, gods and even language. Villages perched on staggering slopes enchant with fairy-tale architecture and their people's easygoing warmth. Hill stations appeal with holiday atmosphere and colonial echoes, while backpacker magnets lure with their blissed-out vibe and mountain beauty. Such is the variety of the Himachali jigsaw that in McLeod Ganj, the Dalai Lama's home-away-from- home, and in Lahaul and Spiti, with their centuries-old Buddhist cultures, you might even think you’ve stumbled into Tibet.
When to GoA May–Jun & mid-Sep–Oct Outside the monsoon season; perfect for trekking and other activities.
A Mid-Jul–mid-Sep The monsoon season; visit Lahaul and Spiti, which stay dry.
A Nov–Apr Great for skiers, but snow blocks the high passes to Lahaul and Spiti.

History Ancient trade routes dominate the history of Himachal Pradesh. Large parts of northern Himachal came under Tibetan control in the 10th century, and Buddhist culture still dominates the mountain deserts of Lahaul and Spiti. The more accessible areas in the south and west were ruled by a host of rajas, ranas and thakurs (noblemen), creating a patchwork of tiny states, with Kangra, Kullu and Chamba the most important. Sikh rajas conquered large areas in the early 19th century, but lost them with the Anglo-Sikh Wars of the 1840s, which brought most of Himachal under British control.
The British started creating little bits of England in the hills of Shimla, Dalhousie and Dharamsala. In 1864 Shimla became the British Raj’s summer capital, and narrow-gauge railways were later pushed through to Shimla and the Kangra Valley. The areas under direct British rule were administered as part of the Punjab, while Chamba and the southern princedoms remained nominally independent, known as the Punjab hill states. Himachal Pradesh was formed from these princely states after Independence, liberating many villages from the feudal system. In 1966 the districts administered from Punjab – principally Kangra, Kullu, Lahaul and Spiti – were added, and full statehood was achievedin 1971. Initially neglected by central government, Himachal has been reinvented as the powerhouse of India, with huge hydroelectric plants providing power for half the country.
SOUTHERN HIMACHAL PRADESH
As soon as you cross the state line from Haryana the landscape starts to crinkle and fold in steep, forest-covered ridges – the foothills that herald the grand Himalayan ranges further north. The main travel destination in the south is Shimla, the former summer capital of British-ruled India. The official district website is http://hpshimla.gov.in.
Shimla
%0177 Pop 170,000 Elev 2205m
Strung out along a 12km ridge, with steep forested hillsides falling away in all directions, the Himachal capital is a good appetite-whetter for the awe-inspiring mountain tracts of the state's interior. Shimla is one of India's most popular hill resorts, buzzing with a happy flow of Indian vacationers and full of echoes of its past role as the summer capital of British India. The long, winding main street, the Mall, runs east and west just below the spine of the hill. South of it, the maze-like alleys of the bustling bazaar cascade steeply down to traffic-busy Cart Rd, which has the train station, Old Bus Station and taxi stands. Traffic is banned from the central part of town, so walking anywhere is pleasant – even when huffing and puffing uphill. A passenger lift provides a quick route between the eastern Mall and Cart Rd. Porters will carry your luggage uphill (about ₹100 from Cart Rd to the Mall) but many double as hotel touts.
The official centre of town is the junction called Scandal Point. From here, the flat open area known as the Ridge stretches east to Christ Church. A jagged line of distant snowy peaks is clearly visible for about half the year. From mid-July to mid-September Shimla is frequently wreathed in cloud, and in winter it often gets a carpeting of snow.
History Until the British arrived, there was nothing atShimla except a sleepy forest glade known as Shyamala (a local name for Kali – the Hindu destroyer-of-evil goddess). Then a Scottish civil servant named Charles Kennedy built a summer home here in 1822 and nothing was ever the same again. In 1864 Simla (its colonial-era name) became the official summer capital of the Raj, and from then until 1939 the entire government of India fled here for half of every year from the sweltering heat of the plains, bringing with them hundreds of muleloads of files, forms and other paraphernalia of government.
When the Kalka–Shimla railway was opened in 1906, Shimla’s status as India’s premier hill station was assured. The town became a centre not only of government but also of social frolics for the elite of the Raj. Maharajas as well as colonial grandees built mansions here, and the season was filled with grand balls at the Viceroy's lodge, picnics in the woods, amateur dramatics at the Gaiety Theatre and much flirtation and frivolity. Rudyard Kipling, who spent many years here, used Shimla as the setting for parts of Kim and his short-story collection Plain Tales from the Hills.Shimla

Henry Irwin's grey-sandstone creation resembles a cross between Harry Potter's Hogwarts and a Scottish baronial castle. Today it houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study: you can take a half-hour tour of a few rooms with interesting photo exhibits, but the old ballroom and dining hall are now alibrary and closed to visitors.
The handsome gardens still make an enjoyable stroll. The Lodge is 3.5km west of Scandal Point: fork left 100m after the Oberoi Cecil hotel, go 700m to the lodge gate, then 400m more to the lodge itself. Opposite the lodge gate is the

Jakhu Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
Shimla’s most famous temple, a steep 30-minute hike up from the east end of the Ridge, is dedicated to the monkey god Hanuman, so it's quite appropriate that hundreds of rhesus macaques loiter around, harassing devotees for prasad (temple-blessed food offerings). Nearby a 33m-high pink statue of Hanuman looms above the treetops and is visible from most of Shimla.
The hilltop is awash in devotional music and the temple houses a small shrine surrounded by funky relief murals of Hanuman performing feats from the Ramayana.
On the way up to the temple, peep through the gates of Rothney Castle (

Hume, who amassed the world's largest collection of stuffed Asiatic birds here before donating it to the British Museum.

About 2.5km west of Scandal Point, up near the telecommunications mast, the state museum occupies an 1860s mansion and houses an impressive collection of Himachali, Rajasthani and Punjabi miniatures, as well as colourful traditional costumes and jewellery, delicate stone and wood carvings, and interesting photos of Himachal temples.

Walking
WALKING
 
Apart from the 'Heritage Walk' from Scandal Point to the Viceregal Lodge and walks to and around Jakhu Temple, there are several routes around Shimla's periphery using minor roads and some forest paths. The Scandal Point tourist office is helpful with routes and the current condition of tracks.
A down-and-up circuit of around 9km leads down through the suburb/village of Kaithu to the green meadow of Annandale, once the site of colonial polo games and now home to a golf course and the Himachal chief minister's helipad. It then goes up a road through lovely cedar woods and down trails to The Glen, a forested valley that was once a playground of British colonialists, then back up to the Mall, about 2km west of Scandal Point.
The road northwest from the Viceregal Lodge gate leads 2km to Summer Hill village (on the Shimla–Kalka railway and site of Himachal Pradesh University). The road southwest from the lodge gate leads in about 2km, via Boileauganj village, to the interesting Kamna Devi Temple at Prospect Hill , with good views.

THE MALL
Traffic-free for a good part of its winding 7km length, the Mall is the heartbeat of Shimla life, strung with hotels, shops, and colonial-era buildings, both decaying and refurbished, and busy with people everywhere. It runs up from Chotta Shimla, southeast of the centre,
to Scandal Point, then west along to the Viceregal Lodge. The Town Hall (

mansion in Hammer Horror films.
West of Scandal Point, just above the Mall, a pretty quasi-Tudor folly houses the post office (1883). A further 700m west the turreted Railway Board Building (

AIR
At the time of research there were no flights to Jubbarhatti airport, 23km west of Shimla. Seasonal services from Delhi may resume at some point. The nearest other airport is at Chandigarh, a four-hour drive from Shimla.
BUS
The Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) runs five comfortable Volvo AC buses to Delhi (₹842, 10 hours) each day, as well as 12 cheaper deluxe and ordinary services (₹384 to ₹592). Other HRTC AC buses head to Manali (₹550, nine hours) at 9.30am and Dharamsala (₹926, nine hours) at 5.30pm. All HRTC
buses leave from the New Bus Station (

 ; %2805164) operates from the bottom of the passenger lift.
Most hotels and travel agencies can organise car transfers to other towns, or a car and driver for an extended tour. A cab for up to four people to Manali costs around ₹5000, to Chandigarh ₹2500 and to Delhi around ₹6000. You pay around ₹500 more for AC. Vishal charges ₹1550 for day trips up to 80km, plus ₹12 for each extra kilometre.
TRAIN
One of the little joys of Shimla is getting to or from it by the narrow-gauge toy train from Kalka, just north of Chandigarh, along the Kalka–Shimla Railway, which has been operating since 1906 and is one of the World Heritage–listed Mountain Railways of India. Although the steam trains are long gone, it’s a scenic five-to-six-hour trip, with 102 tunnels and 988 bridges on its winding 96km route. Shimla station is 1.5km west of Scandal Point on Cart Rd – a 20-to- 30-minute uphill walk to town.
Trains leave Kalka for Shimla at 4am, 5.10am, 5.30am, 6am and 12.10pm, and start the return trip at 10.35am, 2.25pm, 4.25pm, 5.40pm and 6.15pm. The most comfortable option is the Shivalik Express (train 52451 from Kalka at5.30am, train 52452 from Shimla at 5.40pm) with AC chair cars only, costing ₹415/500 uphill/downhill including food. All other trains have 2nd-class coaches (₹25 unreserved, ₹40 to ₹65 reserved) and fairly spartan 1st-class coaches (₹255 to ₹315).
The Himalayan Queen service runs from/to Delhi Sarai Rohilla, with comfortable connection times at Kalka and fares of ₹435/120 (chair car/2nd class) for the Delhi–Kalka (or vice-versa) leg.

A quicker alternative (4¼ hours) for the Delhi–Kalka (or vice-versa) leg is the Kalka Shatabdi: train 12011 departs New Delhi station for Kalka (chair car ₹635) at 7.40am and train 12012 leaves Kalka for New Delhi (₹720) at 5.45pm.
There’s a rail booking office ( Sat) on the Ridge.

8 Getting Around The only way to get around central Shimla is on foot. Taxis are banned from the Ridge and much of the Mall.
Fortunately a two-part lift (per person ₹10; h8am-10pm, to 9pm Dec-Mar & mid-Jul–mid-
Sep) connects Cart Rd with the Mall about 600m east of Scandal Point. Taxis from the train station/New Bus Station to the bottom of the lift cost ₹150/250. Green local buses (₹7) run every few minutes between the New Bus Station and the Old Bus Station on Cart Rd.
INNER LINE PERMITS IN SHIMLAThe permits required for foreigners to travel between Rekong Peo in Kinnaur and Sumdo in Spiti are easily obtained in an hour or two, any day except Sunday or the second Saturday of the month, in Rekong Peo itself or in Kaza (Spiti). You can also try getting the
permit at the office of Shimla's Additional District Magistrate (

Around Shimla
Several villages and small towns outside Shimla attract crowds of day-trippers: the HPTDC Tourist Office organises bus tours (₹270 to ₹310) to places including Naldehra, Narkanda and Chail, if you have time on your hands. Naldehra , 25km northeast of Shimla, is famous chiefly for Naldehra Golf
Club (%0177-2747656; http://naldehragolfclub.in; green fees Indian/foreigner ₹393/562, club hire ₹281; h7am-7pm Apr-Sep, 8am-5pm Oct-Mar), established in 1905 by British viceroy Lord
Curzon. Set among tall cedars, it’s a challenging course with the added quirk that many holes share the same fairway, simply criss-crossing it at different angles. Hire a caddy (₹150 per nine holes) or you won’t know where you’re going. You can have a drink or snack in the clubhouse whether you're playing or not.
Kalka-Shimla Taxi Union charges ₹1400 for a tour to Naldehra and nearby Mashobra. Five daily buses to Naldehra (₹33, one hour, 6.30am to 12.45pm)

10.30pm), with a lovely panoramic terrace, serves a daily-changing menu of Indian, Continental and Asian fare and is open to non-guests by reservation.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
PABBAR VALLEY
This mellow, little-visited valley runs northeast from tiny Hatkoti, set in rolling fields about 105km east of Shimla. Hatkoti's 8th-century Kinnauri-style Hatkeshwari Mata Temple , dedicated to Durga as Mahishasurmardini (slayer of the buffalo demon Mahishasur), and the neighbouring Shiva temple, are well worth a trip, especially when Shaivite pilgrims convene during the Chaitra Navratra and Asvin Navratra festivals in April and October. Pilgrims’ quarters are available at the temple or you can stay in large rooms at the HPTDC's Hotel Chanshal (%01781-240661; www.hptdc.gov.in; s ₹1060-1410, d ₹1410-1880; a), 14km up the valley in Rohru. Beyond Rohru, the scenic valley runs up between 4000m-plus peaks to meet the range forming the west side of Kinnaur's Sangla Valley; there is some excellent hiking. En route from Shimla, 12km before Hatkoti, Jubbal is home to a fanciful 1930 palace built in a mix of Chinese, Indian and European styles for the Rana of Jubbal.
KINNAUR
The district of Kinnaur, stretching up to the Tibetan border in southeastern Himachal, is blessed with magnificent mountain and valley scenery and a distinctive cultural and ethnic mix that changes gradually from Aryan Hindu to Tibetan Buddhist as you progress eastward. Hwy 05 (formerly Hwy 22 and still so marked in places) threads a spectacular route up the Sutlej valley, following,for long sections, the course of the historic Hindustan–Tibet Road, a track constructed by the British in the 19th century in the hope of providing access to Tibet.
This is a land of mountain villages with slate-roofed temples, vast apple orchards, plunging gorges between towering snow-capped peaks, and hair- raising roads – and beyond it lies remote Spiti, the two combining into a loop running from Shimla to Manali or Keylong and an unending sequence of breathtaking scenery. Check road conditions beforehand, as monsoon landslides, floods in the Sutlej valley or heavy winter snows can block the roads for days or even weeks. To travel between Rekong Peo in Kinnaur and Sumdo in Spiti, foreigners need an inner line permit, easily obtained in Rekong Peo.
The Kinnauris are proud but friendly people who mainly survive from farming and apple growing. You can recognise them all over India by their green felt basheri hats. To truly appreciate their land, you need to leave the main road, much of which is scarred by the multiple dam projects that are turning the powerful Sutlej into a massive generator.
Lower Kinnaur gets monsoon rains in July and August, but east of Rekong Peo the landscape quickly becomes much more arid as you enter the rain shadow of the Great Himalaya Range. During the peak tourist seasons here – May, June and October – it's worth booking ahead for rooms in popular spots like Sarahan, the Sangla Valley and Kalpa.

Rampur
%01782 Pop 5700 Elev 1005m
The gateway to Kinnaur, this bustling bazaar town was the winter capital of the Bushahr rajas who ruled Kinnaur. Today, Rampur is mainly a place to change buses, but if you have time, check out the delightful, terraced and turreted Padam Palace , built for the Maharaja of Bushahr in the early 20th century; only the garden is open to visitors. It's just beside the Old Bus Stand in the centre. The Lavi Fair , a huge commercial and cultural get-together in thesecond week of November, attracts traders and pilgrims from all over northwest India.
If you need to stay, Hotel Satluj View (%233924; r ₹550-2350; aW), just past the temple opposite the Old Bus Stand and down some steps, has rooms ranging from dingy but clean to large and air-conditioned, with big windows and balconies overlooking the rushing Sutlej River. Its restaurant (mains ₹125-295; h7am-10.30pm) is the best place to eat in the town centre.
Rampur’s bus station is 2km east of the centre, but many people jump on through buses at the chaotic Old Bus Stand in the centre. From the bus station there are services to Rekong Peo (₹165, five hours) at least hourly till 4.30pm, to Shimla (₹200, five hours) every half-hour till 9.30pm, to Sarahan (₹65, two hours) about every 20 minutes till 6.15pm, and to Sangla (₹170, five hours) at 4.30am and 12.30pm.
Sarahan
%01782 Pop 1700 Elev 1920m
The former summer capital of the Bushahr kingdom, Sarahan is dominated by the fabulous Bhimakali Temple (h7.30am-7pm), built in the traditional Kinnauri manner from layers of stone and timber to absorb the force of earthquakes. There are two towers here, one recently rebuilt after the 12th-century original collapsed, and one from the 1920s (on the left) containing a highly revered shrine to Bhimakali (the local version of Kali) beneath a beautiful silver-filigree canopy on its top floor. The curved, peaked roofs suggest the Tibetan influence on Kinnauri architecture, which becomes more marked as you move up the valley.
For entry to the innermost courtyard with the towers, male visitors must wear a cap (available on the spot) and cameras and leather items must be left in lockers. To the right of the two towers is the squat Lankra Vir Temple , where human sacrifices were carried out right up to the 18th century.

Sangla Valley
%01786
The Sangla Valley (aka Baspa Valley) is a deeply carved cleft between burly mountain slopes, where evergreen forests rise to alpine meadows crowned by snowy summits. Villages here feature houses and temples built in traditional Kinnauri timber-and-stone-style. The hair-raising road to the valley leaves Hwy 05 at Karcham, passing the gushing outflow pipes from a big hydroelectric plant.
Sangla
Pop 2250 / Elev 2680m
The largest settlement in the valley, Sangla is a place where you might find yourself staying overnight if you can't find onward transport. It has a couple of cybercafes and a State Bank ATM on the main street. Clinging to a rocky spur 2km north (about 30 minutes' walk), the village of Kamru was the original capital of the Bushahr kingdom and its impressive tower-style Kamru Fort contains an important shrine to the goddess Kamakhya Devi (shoes and leather items must be removed, heads covered and a waist sash worn).
One of the most appealing places to stay is Sangla Resort Guesthouse
(%242401; dm ₹330, d ₹900-1000; hclosed Dec-Mar), 200m down the road from the
bridge below the bus stand, then 150m up a track to the right. The nine double rooms and one four-bed dorm are spotless, and there are nice views over the surrounding orchards.

Banjara's comfortable, large tents, with beds, furniture and proper bathrooms, are spaced around a flower-strewn apple orchard on a beautiful river bend 6km up the valley from Sangla. There are also two riverbank cottages and 14 rooms in a handsome stone building called the Retreat. It's excellent accommodation, with good food, in a near-idyllic setting.
Pretty Batseri village, across the river, has won awards for cleanliness. Its Badrinarayan Temple burnt down in 1998, but has been rebuilt in full traditional style, even down to the band of erotic carvings on its outside wall.
Chitkul
Pop 600 / Elev 3450m
Chitkul, 25km from Sangla, is easily the most scenic settlement in the valley and sees a steady flow of international and domestic tourists.1 Sights & Activities A good number of traditional Kinnauri-style wooden houses topped with slate roofs survive despite the encroachment of concrete and tin. The Mohatmin Mandir temple in the middle of the village, dedicated to the local god Mathi, has some excellent carving in wood and stone.
Walks & Treks
A short walk up the hillside above the village opens up some great views, and even better is the 3km track up the beautiful valley to the Indo-Tibet Border Post at Nagasti. Civilians are not allowed past the border post even though Tibet is still about 40km away. For longer day walks you can head up the Baspa's side valleys. Chitkul is also where the three-day trekking trail circumambulating Kinner Kailash descends into the Sangla Valley, and trekking routes to Uttarakhand's Garhwal region head over passes on the south side of the valley (it's eight to 10 days to Harsil near Gangotri).
4 Sleeping & Eating The best of the guesthouses is Kinner Heights (%9805628801; r ₹550-850; hclosed Jan-Mar), with good clean rooms.

Rekong Peo
%01786 Pop 2400 Elev 2290m
Rekong Peo is the main administrative and commercial centre for Kinnaur and a transport hub; the main reason for travellers to visit is as a stepping stone to the pretty village of Kalpa, or to obtain an inner line permit for onward travel to upper Kinnaur and Spiti. Known locally as ‘Peo’, the town spreads along a looping road about 10km above Hwy 05. Most hotels, and an SBI ATM, are in the main bazaar below the bus stand.

about an hour if you bring your passport between 10am and 3pm (best in the morning), except on Sundays and the second Saturdayof each month, when the permit-issuing office is closed. The agency helps solo travellers hook up with others for paperwork purposes only, since the powers-that-be prefer groups of two or more. All travellers need to come in person to be photographed. The permits are valid for 14 days.
8 Getting There & Away The bus stand is 2km uphill from the main bazaar by road, or 500m by the steps starting next to the police compound at the top of ITBP Rd.
Buses run roughly hourly until 6.30pm for Shimla (₹375, 10 hours), with deluxe services (₹460) at 5.30am and 1.30pm. For Sarahan, change at Jeori (₹140, four hours). Buses to Sangla (₹65, 2½ hours) and Chitkul (₹104, four hours) leave at 9.30am and noon, and there's a 4pm bus just to Sangla.
For Spiti, there’s a 7am bus to Kaza (₹335, 11 hours) via Nako (₹165, five hours) and Tabo (₹263, eight hours). A second bus heads to Nako at 11.30am.

Kalpa
%01786 Pop 1250 Elev 2960m
Reached by a winding 7km road up through pine woods and apple orchards from Rekong Peo, Kalpa is a little gem of a village. Majestic views of the Kinner Kailash massif grab your eyeballs and don’t let go. There are several guesthouses in Chini, the main part of the village, plus a number of modern hotels on Roghi Rd, a 500m walk or longer drive above the centre. For an ambitious full-day hike, ask locals about the trail up to the meadows and ponds of Chakkha, starting from Hotel Kinner Kailash on Roghi Rd.
Kalpa's central temple group encompasses the colourful Buddhist Hu-Bu- Lan-Khar Gompa (Samdub Choeling), the ornately carved Hindu Narayan- Nagini temple complex just below it, and a recently rebuilt, tower-style Durga temple just above it. In September/October, villagers pile wildflowers in the stone courtyard in the centre of the village during the Phulech (Flaich) Festival.4 Sleeping & Eating

Rekong Peo to SumdoRekong Peo to Sumdo
The road into Spiti is a continuous procession of awe-inspiring vistas, with the road often clinging precariously to cliffsides and the river flashing hundreds of metres below. Foreigners must show their inner line permits at the Akpa checkpoint , 17km past the Rekong Peo turn-off. About 7km beyond, look for the fort-like temples across the river at Moorang. The Moorang road continues to Lambar, the start of the parikrama (ritual circumnavigation) trek around 6050m Kinner Kailash via the Charang La. High above the road near Spillow, Khanum is well worth a detour for its several important Buddhist monasteries and temples, including the Kangyur Gompa, founded by Ringchen Zangpo, the 'Great Translator', in the 10th or 11th century.
Near Khab, Hwy 05 heads off up to the Chinese border at the Shipki La (off- limits to foreigners). The valley road continues to the confluence of the Sutlej and Spiti Rivers, 2km further, then threads the dramatic Spiti gorge upstream.
Nako
Pop 570 / Elev 3660m
High above the Hangrang Valley, this quaint medieval village of stone and mud- brick houses is a great place to break the journey for a day or two. Nako is centred on a small sacred lake , behind which rise towering rock-strewn mountains dotted by stupas. A remote hiking trail leads up over a pass to Tashigang village and monastery (about four hours), from where hardcore hikers can continue about two hours to caves and a shrine at Tsomang; take a guide at the Youth Club Office in Nako centre. On the western edge of Nako you’ll find the four 11th-century chapels of Nako Gompa , containing some fine murals and sculptures in similar styles to those of Spiti's famous Tabo Gompa.
Nako has several simple homestays and guesthouses such as Amar Home Stay (%9418629453; s/d ₹400/500), signposted down steps 20m from the bus stop, where clean rooms with hot-water bathrooms open onto a pretty flower and vegetable garden. Better, but sometimes full with groups, are the bright Lake

North of Nako the road descends to the Spiti River at Chango. Sumdo, 14km further on, marks the border between Kinnaur and Spiti: foreigners must show their inner line permits here.
CENTRAL HIMACHAL PRADESH
Central Himachal is essentially the Kullu and Parvati Valleys – famous for the production of woollen shawls and charas (hashish), and for their wonderful mountain and valley scenery. The area attracts all types of Indian and foreign travellers – hippies, honeymooners, trekkers and adrenaline junkies. At the heart of the scene is Manali, one of northern India's main travel centres, a base for all types of energetic activity from skiing to rafting to paragliding, and also a stepping stone for Lahaul, Spiti and Ladakh via the Rohtang La (3978m). In the hundreds of mountain villages life still goes on in a pretty traditional way, and the chance to get away from the towns and main roads amid the spectacular landscape shouldn't be missed.

Mandi

The rambunctious bazaar town of Mandi (its name means 'market'), at the junction of main roads from Kullu, Shimla and Dharamsala, is no tourist town, and it has a sticky air reminiscent of the plains. But it's dotted with (according to official figures) 81 temples, many of them ancient Shaivite shrines, and it's fun tracking these down in the bazaars and along the banks of the Beas Rivertracking these down in the bazaars and along the banks of the Beas River. Mandi is centred on a sunken-garden-cum-shopping-complex called Indira
Market, with steps on the north side up to the Raj Mahal Palace. The bus stand is 500m east across the Suketi Khad stream, a ₹30 autorickshaw ride.
1 Sights As well as the following, you'll find many more ancient temples just by wandering the streets.
Bhootnath Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE
 
At the entrance to Bhootnath Bazar, 100m northwest of Indira Market, this 16th- century temple recently had its garish paintwork removed, showing off its fine stone carving to much better effect. It's the focal point for the animated Shivaratri Festival honouring Lord Shiva in February/March.
River Temples
If you follow Bhootnath Bazar to the Beas River you’ll find the very colourful Ekardash Rudra Mandir , the British-built Victoria Bridge, some cremation ghats and several carved stone sikhara (corn-cob- or beehive-shaped) temples. Most impressive of these are the intricately sculpted, centuries-old Panchvaktra Mandir and Triloknath Mandir , facing each other across the Beas, 150m east of the ghats.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
MANDI TO BAJAURA
Hidden away in the high pastures between Mandi and Bajaura, a 23km zigzag drive up from the back road between the two towns, is scenic Prashar Lake (2730m), home to the striking, pagoda-style Prashara Temple , built in the 14th century in honour of the sage Prashar Rishi. The lake is also home to a curious floating island, which moves around of its own accord. A bus to Prashar (₹70, three hours) leaves Mandi bus station at 7.30am.A return taxi from Mandi costs around ₹2000.
At Bajaura, 5km south of Bhuntar on Hwy 3, the 9th-century Bisheshwar Mahadev Temple is well worth a stop. A rare and outstandingly handsome Kullu Valley example of the classic stone sikhara temples of the North Indian plains, it's dedicated to Shiva as Lord of the Universe. The temple is covered all over with ornate carving, and niches on the outside contain superb reliefs of Vishnu (west side), Ganesh (south) and Durga (north).
Rewalsar Lake
%01905 / Elev 1350m
Hidden in the hills 24km southwest of Mandi, the sacred lake of Rewalsar is revered by Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. Tibetan Buddhists know it as Tso- Pema (Lotus Lake) and believe it was created when the king of Mandi tried to burn alive the revered Buddhist sage Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche), to prevent his daughter Mandarava running off with the long-haired Tantric master. Today the lake's 800m perimeter is surrounded by a collection of mostly modern temples, monasteries and monuments, in which all three faiths are represented. Despite the untidy architectural hodgepodge, the lake retains a spiritual atmosphere.
The ochre-red Tibetan-style Drikung Kagyu Gompa (www.dk-petsek.org), with its academy of Buddhist studies, stands immediately inside the entrance arch to the lake. Its temple features a large, central Sakyamuni statue, with Padmasambhava to the left. Moving clockwise around the lake, you pass a lakeshore shrine to Padmasambhava and then the Tso-Pema Ogyen Heruka Nyingmapa Gompa , with artful murals and atmospheric afternoon and morning pujas (prayer sessions). A few minutes' detour uphill from the lake, passing the Zigar Drukpa Kagyu Institute , with outsized statues of Tantric protectors in its temple, takes you to a dramatic 12m-high statue of Padmasambhava , with grand views over the lake.
Continuing clockwise around the lake you pass a group of smallish Hindu temples before arriving at lakeshore ghats, where hundreds of fish practically jump out of the water to get at the puffed rice thrown by pilgrims. On the far sideof the lake is the gold-domed Guru Gobind Singh Gurdwara , a Sikh temple built in the 1930s. Rewalsar is of special significance to Sikhs as the place where, in 1701, Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh guru, issued an (unsuccessful) call to the Hindu rajas of the Punjab hills for joint resistance to the Mughals.
The other main pilgrim site is the Padmasambhava Cave , high above the lake on the ridge, where Padmasambhava allegedly meditated. Take a taxi (one- way/return ₹500/600) or jump on one of the five daily buses to Naina Devi Temple (₹30) and get off 1km before the temple.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK TIRTHAN VALLEYTIRTHAN VALLEY
East of Mandi the main Hwy 3 (formerly Hwy 21) threads a dramatic gorge along the Beas River before turning north towards Kullu at Larji. A side-road southeast here leads up the Tirthan (or Banjar) Valley into the remote, beautiful Inner Seraj region, ripe for walks in the hills and valleys and between isolated traditional villages. There is a scattering of budget and midrange accommodation in and around such villages as Banjar, Sairopa, Gushaini, Jibhi and Shoja. You can hike a steep 6km up from Banjar to Chehni village to see one of the tallest temple-towers in Himachal – six, seven or 11 storeys high (depending how you count them).
Gushaini is one access point to the Great Himalayan National Park
(www.greathimalayannationalpark.com; per day Indian/foreigner ₹50/200), which gained World Heritage status in 2014. The pristine 754-sq-km national park stretches east up to the 6000m-plus peaks of the Great Himalaya Range, with a variety of wildlife, including snow leopards, brown and black bears, and over 250 bird species, such as the rare western tragopan. Lush forests lower down give way to alpine meadows and high-altitude glaciers. There are plenty of hiking and trekking opportunities here, from easy day walks in the buffer zone (called the Ecozone) to demanding treks in the spectacular upper reaches.The park has an information centre at Larji and a visitors centre at Sai Ropa on the Banjar–Gushaini road. For guided tours and treks and other activities, contact Sunshine Himalayan Adventures (%9418102083;

For groups of four or more, Sunshine typically charges US$50 per person per day for treks and US$65 for birdwatching tours, including food, permits, local transport, camping equipment and staff. It also offers wildlife tours and mountaineering expeditions.
South from Shoja, the road climbs to the panoramic 3223m Jalori Pass (normally closed for two or three winter months), from where you can walk 6km east (mostly level) to the sacred Saryolsar Lake , or 3km west (uphill) to the faint ruins of Raghupur Fort .

Parvati Valley
%01902
The Parvati River enters the Beas just above Bhuntar and its ethereally beautiful valley stretches back up to the hot springs at Manikaran and beyond. The valley has a well-deserved reputation for its wild and cultivated crops of charas, and a couple of villages along the river have been transformed into hippie/backpacker hang-outs, offering cheap accommodation, international food and nonstop music to crowds of dreadlocked and pierced travellers. Like Manali, the Parvati is an established stop on the 'hummus trail' followed by post-military-service Israeli travellers. Police sometimes set up checkpoints along the roads to search for charas.
There are some excellent treks in the area, including over the Chandrakani Pass to/from Naggar, or the Pin-Parvati Pass to/from Spiti. For safety reasons, solo trekking is not recommended.Jari
Jari is a ramshackle roadside bazaar village 20km up the Parvati Valley from its mouth. Travellers head for the peaceful hillside hamlet of Mateura Jari, a 700m uphill hike from Jari bus stop (follow the 'Village Guest House' signs).
For guide services to Malana or trekking anywhere in the Parvati Valley, contact Negi’s Himalayan Adventure (%9805105800, 9816081894; www.negis-
himalayan-adventure.com; Hotel Negi's Nest, Chowki) at Hotel Negi's Nest (%9816081894; r
₹1500-3000; W), across the river from Jari (a ₹150 taxi ride). Owner Chhape Negi is head of the area’s mountain rescue team, so he’s as reliable as it gets. A guide for a day costs ₹1500 to ₹2000, and trekking is around ₹2750 per person per day, plus transport. The rooms here are good, comfortable and pine-panelled and have clean bathrooms, and there's a restaurant and kitchen use for guests.
WARNING – DEADLY VACATIONS
Since the mid-1990s more than two dozen foreign tourists have disappeared from the Kullu and Parvati Valleys. While some got too deep into the local drug trade and crossed the wrong people, others became lost or fatally injured while trekking alone through the confusing and rugged mountain terrain.
If you plan to head into the hills, we recommend going with a guide who can steer you away from natural – and human – hazards. It’s a good idea to let your guesthouse know where you are going and when you plan to return. Avoid walking alone, and be cautious about befriending sadhus (holy people) or others wandering in the woods. So go, hike, and enjoy this incredible area – just be smart about it, for your family’s sake!
4 Sleeping & Eating In addition to the places listed here you'll find more homestays and guesthouses tucked away along the pathways and in Punthal, 1km further.
Village Guest House

GUESTHOUSE
This large, welcoming property is the first place you come to in Mateura Jari andhas the most comfortable rooms, especially those with attached bathroom ranged along the pretty garden. The family here are charming and they serve up good Indian and traveller food too (mains ₹70 to ₹170).

Chandra Place
(%8894280028; r ₹100-350)
GUESTHOUSE
This laid-back spot has an awesome covered terrace with blissful views, and its own cafe.
CHARAS
Over the years, many tourists have been lured to the Parvati Valley and the Manali area by the famous local charas (hashish), which is seriously potent stuff. Though it’s smoked fairly openly in the Parvati Valley, Old Manali and Vashisht, it’s still illegal and local police do arrest people for possession (or hit them for hefty bribes).
Malana
Remote Malana, high on a hillside 20km up a side valley north of Jari, is one of the strangest villages in India. Its people – descended, according to legend, from deserters from Alexander the Great's army – speak their own unique language, operate what's called the world's oldest democracy, and consider outsiders unclean. Malana's famous charas, known as 'cream', is the backbone of its economy, and is what many visitors mainly come for. A rough road now reaches within striking distance of Malana, but for centuries it was one of the most isolated spots in the region. Be ready for random police checkpoints on the road, and bring your passport, because security at the hydroelectric station en route may want to see it.
Once in the village, you must obey a litany of esoteric rules or face fines of ₹2500. Don't step off the main path, don't touch the temples or photograph themwithout permission, don't stray onto any sacred spots (even though there's nothing obvious to identify them), and don't touch any villagers or their belongings. To get the most out of the cultural experience and avoid breaking any rules, it’s worthwhile visiting with a knowledgable guide.
Over half of Malana's traditional wood and stone houses were burned in a fire in 2008 and some have been replaced by cinderblock boxes, but the temples were rebuilt in traditional wood and stone, with intricately carved balconies. They are dedicated to the local deity Jamdagni (Jamlu) Rishi, and attract pilgrims from around the region, especially during Malana's main festival around 20 August. One of the two main temples stands on the village's central open space, facing a stone platform and stepped seating for village assemblies (Malana's 'parliament').
Malana has a half-dozen guesthouses, mostly at the top of the village and run by outsiders, with rooms for ₹200 to ₹300. Friendly Chand View Guest House (%9805261446; r ₹250-500) has some attached bathrooms and decent Indian and traveller food (mains ₹100 to ₹180).
The easy way to reach Malana is by taxi from Jari to Nerang (₹800 one-way, ₹1300 return with a three-hour wait), a collection of shacks from which it's a 30- to-45-minute walk up to the village. There are good walks in the area, and Parvati Valley taxi unions promote 'Magic Valley' day trips on which they'll take you to Nerang (for Malana) and then another 2km up to the road's end, where you continue a kilometre or two on foot. The Chandrakani Pass, a steep two- hour hike up from Malana, leads to Naggar in two or three days, and adventurers can head southeast over the Rashol Pass to Kasol (17km), staying in a homestay in Rashol en route.
Kasol
Stretched along the lovely Parvati River and with mountain views to the northeast, Kasol is the main traveller hang-out in the valley. It’s a small village, but almost overrun with reggae bars, bakeries and cheap guesthouses catering to a largely hippie/Israeli crowd. It's also a summertime venue for trance parties transplanted from Goa, and at any time an easy base for exploring the forested valley or just chilling out. The village is divided into Old Kasol on the Bhuntar
id    f i   b id         d N     K     l       h  M   ik         idside of its bridge, and New Kasol on the Manikaran side.
For an easy 3.5km stroll, cross the footbridge over the Parvati River and walk downstream to Chalal and Katagla villages. Several rustic guesthouses and cafes along here, mostly foreign-run, are perfect for those who want to really
'turn on, tune in and drop out'. Recross the river at Katagla to catch a passing bus back to Kasol (₹8). More remote paths continue from Katagla to Chowki.
4 Sleeping There's plenty of budget accommodation. Some guesthouses close down for winter from November to March.
Taji Place

GUESTHOUSE
A big green-and-yellow house on a sweet and spacious riverside property, Taji has a range of tidy rooms and a couple of well-equipped cottages, plus a private hot spring (₹2 per minute). It's down an unsigned lane 80m past Evergreen restaurant in New Kasol.

Moon Dance, just west of the bridge, stands tall among the many traveller restaurants serving similar 'three Is' menus (Italian/Israeli/Indian) for its great baked goods, strong coffee and excellent-value breakfasts in the sunny courtyard.
8 Information Kasol has plenty of internet cafes, charging ₹40 per hour. The Central Bank of India ATM , in a side-street just east of the bridge, accepts international cards.
8 Getting There & Away Buses between Bhuntar and Manikaran pass through Kasol. Taxi fares from the stand near the bridge include ₹150 to Manikaran, ₹700 to Barsheni, ₹900 to Bhuntar and ₹1950 to Manali.
PIN-PARVATI TREK
Only accessible from late June to late September/early October (with September the best month), this strenuous but rewarding six-to-nine-day wilderness trek crosses the snowbound Pin-Parvati Pass (5319m) from the Parvati Valley to the Pin Valley in Spitisnowbound Pin-Parvati Pass (5319m) from the Parvati Valley to the Pin Valley in Spiti. There is accommodation at Khir Ganga and Mudh, but none in between, so you’ll have to be self-sufficient or go with a trekking agency. Organised treks are relatively pricey because your crew (often Nepali) needs to be transported back to their starting point. Sometimes two sets of porters are required, handing over loads near the pass.
From Barsheni, the route ascends through forest and pasture, past Khir Ganga hot springs to Thakur Khan. Two more days through an arid alpine zone takes you to High Camp (also called Plateau Camp). A challenging tramp over snow and scree will take you up to the pass, then down into the Pin Valley. A day or two for acclimatisation and/or rest on the way up will probably be beneficial, and the final stage could easily be broken into two days of hiking through the Pin Valley National Park to Mudh.
The trek can also be done in the east-to-west direction.

Manikaran
Pop 6100 / Elev 1737m
With steam continually issuing from the river bank beneath its large temple, the busy little pilgrim town of Manikaran, 4km east of Kasol, is famous for its hot springs and is sacred for both Sikhs and Hindus. According to legend, a giant snake stole the goddess Parvati's earrings while she was bathing (during an
11,000-year meditation session with Shiva), then snorted them out from underground, along with various other jewels, which released the hot springs. The water emerging from the ground is hot enough to boil rice and has to be cooled with river water for bathing. Locals say it can cure everything from rheumatism to bronchitis.
1 Sights & Activities The multistorey Sri Guru Nanak Ji Gurdwara , on the north bank of the river, was built in 1940.The main prayer hall, with its carpets and glittering glass columns, is on the top floor (shoes off, head-coverings on, for men and women). One level down is the eating hall where free rice, dahl, curry, chapatis and tea are served round the clock to all comers (and these meals are as good as any in town). Below that are men's and women's indoor bathing pools and, to one side, a sauna-like 'hot cave'. Across the footbridge are a more inviting open-air men's pool and another enclosed women's pool. Bring a swimming costume, towel and flip-flops if you want to bathe.
Next to the gurdwara is a Shiva temple where the rice for the gurdwara cooks in big pots in pools of boiling hot-spring water. A happy, quite light- hearted atmosphere prevails in both temples.
Along the main street of the traffic-free north side of town you'll find the ornate wooden Naina Bhagwati Temple , dedicated to the goddess, born from Shiva's third eye, who located Parvati's missing earrings.
4 Sleeping & Eating Manikaran is an easy half-day trip from Kasol, but there are several guesthouses if you want to stay, mostly in the traffic-free main village on the north side of the river. Note that alcohol is banned this side of the river.
Fateh Paying Guesthouse
(%9816894968; r ₹300; i)
GUESTHOUSE
Signposted up an alley in the old part of town, this big blue house has just five simple but pleasant rooms, with welcoming owners, a sunny rooftop terrace and a tiny hot-spring pool. Unlike most places here, Fateh keeps the same rates all year. Local meals are available.Sharma Guest House
(%9418422343; r ₹200-400)
GUESTHOUSE
In the kitschy bazaar area near the gurdwara, Sharma has adequate rooms in its main building, but the top-floor rooms in its new building nearby are the best budget lodgings in town – comfy and clean, with good mattresses and views across the valley from the shared balcony. Rates can triple or more in the June– July peak season.
8 Getting There & Away Buses run at least hourly until 6.30pm from Manikaran to Bhuntar (₹50, 1½ hours), via Kasol (₹5, 10 minutes). There are also several daily to Kullu (₹70, 2½ hours) and Manali – or you can change in Bhuntar. Taxis from Manikaran bus station charge ₹500 to Barsheni, ₹1000 to Bhuntar and ₹2200 to Manali.
WORTH A TRIP
KHIR GANGA
This sloping alpine meadow is a beautiful three-to-four-hour walk up the Parvati Valley from Barsheni, which is 13km up from Manikaran. The meadow is home to delectable hot springs and a rundown collection of shack guesthouses (rooms ₹200 to ₹400) and cafe- restaurants, open from about April to October – it's a popular spot to drop out for a few days. A day trip to Khir Ganga and back is also well worthwhile. The walk from Barsheni, in which you ascend about 800m, is also the first stage of the Pin-Parvati trek. Paths run along both sides of the valley, through Nakthan village on the north side, and Kalga village on the south side, meeting just below Flower Cafe, about 45 minutes before Khir Ganga. The Nakthan route is prettier, sunnier and more frequented.
The hot springs (hdawn-dusk), at the top of the meadow, are the perfect temperature – hot but not too hot – and feature a large men's pool with fantastic views and a smaller, enclosed women's pool from which you can at least see the sky. The pools are part of a temple, so decorum is required – no mixed bathing, nudity or smoking!
Buses to Barsheni (₹25, one hour) leave roughly hourly from about 7.30am to 5.30pm, from the road above Manikaran bus station. Some of them come from Bhuntar and pass through Jari and Kasol en route. The last bus back down leaves Barsheni at 5pm. Taxis from Manikaran cost ₹500.Kullu
%01902 / Pop 18,500 / Elev 1220m
The bustling administrative capital of the Kullu Valley makes a gritty change from the hippie holiday resorts elsewhere in the valley, and in October it stages the area's most colourful and fascinating festival, the Kullu Dussehra.
The Beas River runs down the east side of Kullu, and its tributary, the Sarvari River, runs across the middle of town, dividing Kullu into southern and northern halves. The southern part has the taxi stand, tourist office, Dussehra grounds (two large, adjoining, open spaces) and most restaurants and hotels. The bus station and Raghunath Temple are north of the Sarvari. A footbridge near the bus station crosses to a bazaar street that brings you out near the Hotel Shobla International.
1 Sights & Activities
Raghunath Temple
(h6.30am-9pm mid-Apr–mid-Sep, 7.30am-7.30pm mid-Sep–mid-Apr)
HINDU TEMPLE
Kullu's pre-eminent temple enshrines the Kullu Valley's most important idol, a tiny bronze image of Raghunath Ji (Rama) that lords it over the Dussehra celebrations. The 17th-century temple is on the hill above the bus station and near the Raja Rupi, the former Kullu rajas' palace; it's not particularly spectacular, and the main shrine is closed from 11.30am to 5.30pm (12.30pm to 4pm from mid-September to mid-April), but you will probably still be able to peer in through its barred window.
Bijli Mahadev Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
 
There are several important temples in Kullu's surrounding hills. Reached by a 3km hike up from Chansari, a 22km drive southeast from Kullu, the hilltop Bijli Mahadev is surmounted by a 20m wooden pole that attracts occasional divine blessings in the form of lightning. The surge of power shatters the stone Shiva lingam inside the temple, which is then glued back together with butter. There are spectacular panoramas over both the Kullu and Parvati Valleys from here.a e spectacu a  pa o a   as ove  bot  t e   u  u a d   a vat  Va  eys   o

Bijli Mahadev attracts crowds of pilgrims during the Shaivite Sawan Kamaina festival from mid-July to mid-August. A return taxi from Kullu costs ₹1100, or look for a shared taxi at Ramshila, 2km northeast on the main road, where the road to Bijli Mahadev starts.T Tours The Kullu Taxi Operators’ Union (%222332; www.kullutaxiunion.com), by the Dussehra grounds in the southern part of town, offers sightseeing day tours to four local temples (not including Bijli Mahadev) for ₹1100, or to Prashar Lake for ₹2400.
KULLU DUSSEHRA
Raghunath Ji, the most important god in Kullu town and valley, is a version of Rama, the hero god of the Ramayana, so you might expect Kullu Dussehra, the October festival that celebrates Rama's victory over the demon-king Ravana, to be something special here. Unlike the one-day celebrations elsewhere, Kullu Dussehra goes on for a week. The opening day is the most exciting, with 200 or more village deities (devtas), including Hadimba from Manali, arriving in Kullu on palanquins, having been carried here on foot (for several days from the remotest villages). They pay homage at Raghunath Ji's temple in the early afternoon, before moving down to the Dussehra grounds in a wonderful cavalcade, with drums beating and giant trumpets blaring, decked in gorgeous garlands and draperies studded with silver masks. Here the tiny Raghunath Ji idol is placed in a large wooden chariot and pulled to its allotted place by teams of rope-hauling devotees amid excited crowds.The village devtas 'dance' – tilting from side to side and charging backwards and forwards – before settling down in their own allotted positions around the grounds, where they and their attendants camp for the week of the festival.
The rest of the week is focused mainly on a huge retail fair spread over the Dussehra grounds, outbreaks of music and dancing around the devta tents, plus evening dance, music and other performances in the adjacent auditorium. On the seventh day everyone goes home. The end of the festivities no longer sees the traditional sacrifice of a buffalo, goat, cock, fish and freshwater crab on the banks of the Beas, as animal sacrifices at religious festivals were banned in Himachal Pradesh in 2014.
Accommodation in Kullu is scarce and expensive during Dussehra, but it’s an easy day trip from Manali or even Kasol.

8 Information The HPTDC tourist office (%222349; h10am-5pm), near the Dussehra grounds, is helpful with local information and can book seats on the comfortable HPTDC buses from Manali to Delhi and Shimla. The SBI has ATMs nearby.
SHOPPING FOR SHAWLS
The Kullu Valley is famous for its traditional wool shawls – lightweight but wonderfully warm and attractively patterned – and the highway between Bhuntar and Manali is lined with scores of shops and showrooms. Kullu shawls are woven on wooden hand-loomsusing wool from sheep or hair from pashmina goats or angora rabbits. This industry provides an income for thousands of local women, many of whom have organised themselves into shawl-weaving cooperatives.
For high quality without the hard sell, head to the nearest branch of Bhuttico
(www.bhutticoshawls.com), the Bhutti Weavers’ Cooperative, which was established in 1944 and has showrooms in every town in the valley and several beyond, plus a factory showroom (h9am-7pm) at Bhutti Colony, 8km south of Kullu. Bhuttico charges fixed prices, so it’s a good place to gauge price and quality. Expect to pay upwards of ₹700 for a lambswool shawl, ₹1200 to ₹1600 for an angora-lambswool blend, ₹3500 for pashmina-lambswool and ₹6000 for pure pashmina. Bhuttico also makes scarves, topis, jackets, bags, gloves, pullas (slippers made from cannabis stalks), and pattus, the wonderfully patterned wraparound wool garments that are Kullu women's traditional clothing.
8 Getting There & Away
BUS
A mixture HRTC and private buses runs about every 15 minutes to Bhuntar (₹20, 30 minutes), Manali (₹50, 90 minutes) and Mandi (₹90, two hours). There are several buses to Manikaran (₹70, 2½ hours) via Jari and Kasol, or you can go to Bhuntar and change. Buses from Manali to destinations beyond the Kullu Valley stop in Kullu about 1½ hours after departure.
TAXI
Sample one-way fares include ₹700 to Naggar, ₹900 to Kasol and ₹1050 to Manali.
Naggar
%01902 Pop 550 Elev 1760m
High on the east side of the Kullu Valley, sleepy Naggar was once capital of the Kullu kingdom and is perhaps the most charming village in the valley today. Russian painter and explorer Nicholas Roerich (Nikolai Rerikh) liked it so much he settled here in the early 20th century. It's an easy day trip from Manali, but with interesting sights and some good guesthouses and restaurants, it's a fine place for a few days' relaxing stay.1 Sights
Naggar Castle
(admission ₹30; h9am-6pm)
FORT
Built by the rajas of Kullu around 1500, this fort-cum-mansion is a fine example of the earthquake-resistant alternating-stone-and-timber style of Himachali architecture. Sold to the British assistant commissioner in 1846, it later became a courthouse and then, in 1976, a hotel. The Jagti Patt Temple , inside, houses a 2.4m-long sacred stone slab said to have been carried here by a swarm of deities in the form of honey bees.

MUSEUM
(%248290; www.roerichtrust.org; admission/camera/video ₹50/30/60; h10am-1pm & 1.30-6pm Tue- Sun, to 5pm Nov-Mar)
This fascinating memorial and museum complex 1km above the castle focuses on the former home of Russian painter, writer and Inner Asian explorer Nicholas Roerich and his wife Elena. They settled here in 1928 and stayed until his death in 1947. The couple's semimystical aesthetico-orientalist philosophising had an international following in their lifetimes but it is Nicholas' art that has had the more enduring appeal.
The house's lower floor displays some of his landscape paintings (many depicting Himalayan mountains), while the upper floor preserves some of the private rooms. Also on the property are Nicholas' samadhi (tomb) and an exhibit on the Roerichs' artist son Svyatoslav and his wife, the Indian film star Devika Rani.
Down the road there's a good little book and souvenir shop, while a five- minute uphill walk takes you to the Urusvati Himalayan Research Institute , with further exhibits on the work of the Roerichs and their associates.
Temples
Naggar is home to several intriguing and beautiful small temples. Down the street beside the castle, the 11th-century sikhara-style Vishnu Mandir is covered in ornate carvings. Turn left just past this, then left at the next fork, tothe lovely little Gauri Shankar Temple , of similar style and date. It's dedicated to Shiva and the exterior wall recesses contain carvings of dancers, musicians and birds.
About 400m up the road from the castle, the pagoda-style Tripura Sundari Temple is sacred to the local earth-mother goddess. The existing building is only about 35 years old, but the site has probably been sacred since pre-Hindu times. The track leading uphill off the road here leads 1km to a junction where a right turn takes you 150m to the Murlidhar Krishna Temple , dating from about the 11th century, on the site of the ancient town of Thawa, which pre- dated Naggar by around 1000 years.
2 Activities Naggar is the starting point for the excellent three-day trek to Malana village via the 3650m Chandrakani Pass, accessible between May and October (though rainy July is better avoided). Himalayan Mountain Treks
(%9418149827; www.poonammountain.in; Poonam Mountain Lodge), down the small street beside Naggar Castle, and Ragini Treks & Tours (%9817076890; raginitours@hotmail.com; Hotel Ragini), just above the castle, are experienced operators who can organise this and other regional treks, and guided day walks.
It's feasible to reach Malana in two days and, depending on the season, there are teashops en route where you can sleep if you have a sleeping bag, but a slower pace will give you more time to enjoy the mountains. Once over the pass, detours to Nagruni village (one extra day) or the Malana glacier (three or four extra days) are worthwhile. Himalayan Mountain Treks charges US$50 to
US$60 per person per day for guided and equipped treks with porters.
For a straightforward half-day walk you could do just the first few kilometres of the trek, as far up as traditional Rumsu village, with its impressive wooden temple.4 Sleeping & Eating o Alliance Guesthouse

GUESTHOUSE
The eight rooms in this family-run place are clean and pleasant but the best thing is the garden, which leads down to charming 1500-year-old stone shrines to Shiva and Ganesh. It's a 400m walk below the castle in Chanalti village.
The Castle

HERITAGE HOTEL
The HPTDC hotel occupying the castle has historical atmosphere but decor and furnishings are mostly spartan. Prices depend mainly on room size and views (which are superb from some rooms). There’s an affordable restaurant (mains ₹160-450; h8am-10pm) with a terrace overlooking the valley.
Hotel Ragini
(%248185; www.naggarragini.com; r ₹1000-1500; iW)
HOTEL
Ragini is a clean, modern hotel just up from the castle, with bright, balconied
rooms and a neat garden. The Ragini Bakery (snacks & light meals ₹20-200; h7.30am-
10pm) overlooking the street does good coffee, lassi, baked goods and other snacks.8 Getting There & Away Buses run about half-hourly between Manali and Naggar between 8am and 6pm (₹30, one hour) and there are several buses to and from Kullu (₹30, one hour). In either case, if there's no bus to Naggar itself, you can always get one to Patlikuhl, on the Kullu–Manali main road, and then a shared taxi (₹20) or autorickshaw (₹70) from there. A taxi from Manali to Naggar costs ₹800. Autorickshaws up to the castle from the bus stop are
₹50.
Manali

Surrounded by high peaks in the beautiful green valley of the Beas River, with mountain adventures beckoning from all directions, Manali is a year-round magnet. Backpackers come to hang out in the hippie villages around the main town; adventurers come for trekking, climbing, mountain biking, canyoning, paragliding, rafting and skiing; and Indian families and honeymooners come for the cool mountain air and a taste of snow on a day trip to the Rohtang La. Manali is also the main jumping-off point (between June and October) for Ladakh and Spiti. It makes sense to unwind and feed up here for a few days while organising your trip into the mountains.
So popular has Manali become among Indian tourists that this once bucolic retreat now has an estimated 800 to 1000 hotels and guesthouses in the town and outskirts, and from mid-April to mid-July, mid-September to mid-October, and over Christmas–New Year it gets pretty well overrun, with dire traffic jams along its narrow lanes and the main roads approaching town. Most travellers stay in the villages of Vashisht or Old Manali, which have a laid-back vibe and plenty of services, but are partially closed for winter from about November to April.Manali & Vashisht

 )
This much-revered wood-and-stone mandir, constructed in 1553, stands in a clearing in the cedar forest about 2km west of central Manali. Pilgrims come from across India to honour Hadimba, the demon wife of the Pandava Bhima from the Mahabharata. The temple's wooden doorway, under a three-tier pagoda- style roof, is richly carved with figures of gods, animals and dancers; antlers and ibex horns adorn the outside walls.
Inside is a large sacrificial stone where grisly animal slaughterings have traditionally taken place during the three-day Dhungri Mela in May. Gatothkach, the warrior son of Hadimba and Bhima, is worshipped in the form of a sacred
tree (

AREA
About 2km northwest of the Mall on the far side of the Manalsu Nala stream, Old Manali still has some of the feel of an Indian mountain village once you get past the core backpacker zone. There are some remarkable old houses of wood
and stone, and the towered Manu Maharishi Temple (

OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AROUND MANALI
Manali is the adventure sports capital of Himachal Pradesh, and all sorts of activities can be organised through operators here.
CANYONING
You can do this in several places around Manali with agencies including Himalayan Extreme Centre, which charges ₹2500 to ₹2800 per person for day outings.
MOUNTAIN BIKING
Agencies offer bike hire for ₹350 to ₹850 per day (and can give current info on routes) or will take you on guided tours – ranging from the exciting 51km descent from the Rohtang La (best in late September and October after the monsoon and summer traffic have died down) to two-week trips to Ladakh or Kinnaur and Spiti costing around ₹3000 per person per day with vehicle support.person per day with vehicle support.
MOUNTAINEERING
Agencies such as Himalayan Caravan, Himalayan Trails and Himalayan Adventurers can arrange expeditions of 10 to 14 days to peaks around the head of the Solang valley, including Friendship Peak (5289m) and Ladakhi (5342m), which are suitable for those with limited experience (training is available), and the more difficult Hanuman Tibba (5930m) and Manali Peak (5669m). Typical prices are around ₹5000 per person per day including instructor/guides, equipment, transport, food and camping.
PARAGLIDING
Paragliding is popular at Solang Nullah and at Gulaba and Marhi (below the Rohtang La) from April to October (except during the monsoon). Tandem flights at Solang Nullah cost ₹1000 (a two-minute flight) or ₹3000 (10 minutes). Adventure-tour operators can organise 20-or-30-minute tandem flights for ₹3500 to ₹4000 – and also solo-flight training courses, as can Hotel Iceland.
RAFTING
There is 14km of Grade II and III white water between Pirdi, on the Beas River 3km south of Kullu, and the take-out point at Jhiri; trips with adventure agencies from Manali cost around ₹1000 per person, plus transport. May, June, late September and October are the best times (it's banned from mid-July to mid-September because of the monsoon).
ROCK-CLIMBING
Cliffs at Solang, Aleo and Vashisht have a good range of bolted and traditional routes ranging from French 5a to 7b (British 4a to 6b). A day's climbing for beginners or experienced climbers costs ₹1500 to ₹2000 with Manali agencies, including transport. Longer courses are also offered. Solang and the Chatru area in Lahaul are tops for bouldering.
SKIING & SNOWBOARDING
From around mid-January to mid-March, Solang Nullah transforms into Himachal’s main ski and snowboarding resort. Equipment can be hired from Manali agencies or Solang Nullah hotels for ₹1000 per day. The piste offers limited options for experienced skiers, but there is off-piste powder and backcountry skiing from the top of the cable car. In April and May Gulaba becomes the off-piste centre with snowshoe-trekking up nearby peaks. Agencies such Himalayan Adventurers and Himalayan Extreme Centre offer one-to-two- week ski touring packages. Heli-skiing packages to high-altitude powder can be arranged through Himalayan Heli Adventures (%251593; www.himachal.com).
WALKING & TREKKING
Manali is a popular starting point for organised mountain treks. Most agencies offer multiday treks for between ₹2000 and ₹3000 per person per day including guides,

i          tJ        S    t     b         dtransport, porters or pack animals, food and camping equipment. June, September and October are overall the best months. Popular options include Beas Kund (three days), the 4250m-high Bhrigu Lake (three days), the Hamta Pass to Lahaul (four days), the Chandrakani Pass from Naggar to Malana (three days) and, more demanding, the Pin- Parvati Trek (six to nine days) or routes west to the isolated village of Bara Bhangal and on to the Chamba or Kangra Valleys (11 days or more).
Plenty of shorter walks are possible from Manali. The usual rules on safe trekking apply – tell someone where you are going and never walk alone. Guides for day hikes typically cost ₹1500. One recommended day-hike is up to Lama Dugh meadow west of town (about four hours up, three hours down). A good short walk goes from Vashisht to Jogini waterfall and back.
4 Sleeping Many midrange and top-end hotels slash prices dramatically outside the peak seasons. The best budget places, by far, are a short distance north of Manali town in the villages of Old Manali and Vashisht, where prices are often negotiable. The best upmarket hotels are found along Circuit House and Club House Rds, heading towards Old Manali.

AIR
Manali’s closest airport is 50km south at Bhuntar.
BUS
Government-run HRTC buses go from the bus station (

 ).
HPTDC buses also go from the bus station but tickets are sold at their office. Private buses start from a large bus park 1.2km south of the bus station; tickets are sold at travel agencies along the Mall.
A Delhi The most comfortable options are the HPTDC's AC Volvo coaches at 5.30pm and 6.30pm (₹1300, 15 hours). Private travel agencies run similar overnight services for ₹800 to ₹1600, depending on season. HRTC also has AC Volvos (₹1285/798 to Delhi/Chandigarh) at 4pm, 5pm and 6.30pm, plus an AC deluxe (₹1005/640) at 5.50pm, and 12 ordinary services daily (₹655/442). A Kullu & Parvati Valleys Buses go to Kullu (₹50, 1½ hours) every few minutes, many continuing to Bhuntar (₹70, 2½ hours) and Mandi (₹163, four hours). Buses to Naggar (₹30, one hour) go about half-hourly from about 7am to 6pm. For the Parvati Valley, change at Bhuntar.
A Lahaul & Spiti The Rohtang La, between Manali and Lahaul, is normally open from mid-May to early November, and the Kunzum La, between Lahaul and Spiti, from mid-June to mid-October (exact dates depend on snow conditions). A new tunnel bypassing the Rohtang La is due to open in 2017, opening up Lahaul to year-round visits. In season, HRTC runs up to seven daily buses to Keylong, Lahaul (₹170, seven hours), and one at 5.30am to Kaza, Spiti (₹300, 11 hours).
A Leh The bone-shaking, exhausting and spectacular road to Leh is normally open from early June to some time in October (exact dates depend on roadconditions). From July to mid-September, an HPTDC bus (₹2500, 33 hours) departs at 9am every second day, with an overnight stop at Keylong, where tent accommodation, dinner and breakfast are included in the fare. Throughout the season the Him-aanchal Taxi Operators Union runs minibuses to Leh departing at 2.30am without an overnight halt (₹1000 to ₹1500, about 18 hours), or departing at 6am with an overnight halt (₹1500 to ₹2200, or ₹2200 to ₹3200 with accommodation, dinner and breakfast included); book a day in advance. Travel agencies run similar minibuses in July and August. On all journeys to Leh, bring snacks and warm clothing and be alert to the symptoms of acute mountain sickness.
A Other Destinations For Shimla, the HPTDC runs a daily bus at 8am (₹550, nine hours) and there are also six HRTC buses (ordinary/AC ₹390/550). For Dharamsala, HRTC buses (₹355, 10 hours) go at 8am and 6.30pm, and there's usually a private bus (₹550) at 7.30pm.
MOTORCYCLE
Many people tackle the mountain passes to Ladakh or Spiti on bought or rented bikes. You can book into a group tour with accommodation, food and backup vehicles included at around ₹5000 per day, or just rent a bike and head off on your own.
For rentals, expect to pay ₹1200/1500 per day for a 350/500cc Enfield, down to ₹800 for a 150cc Pulsar. Make sure the deal includes spares, tools and at least third-party insurance. Reliable rental places include the following:

HAMTA PASS TREK
Easily accessible from Manali, this camping trek crosses from the Kullu Valley to Lahaul's Chandra Valley via the 4270m Hamta Pass.

The climb to the pass from the campsite at Balu Ka Gera (3540m) is steep and tiring, but there are sublime snow-peak views from the top. Best times for this trek are the second half of September and October, after the monsoon. Chatru is on the road between Gramphu (on the north side of the Rohtang La) and Spiti.

8 Getting Around Hadimba Autorickshaw Operators Union (
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %253366; the Mall) has an office at the south end of the Mall
with a large sign listing fares to various destinations, but drivers here often refuse to go for the posted prices. Drivers waiting at the top of the Mall tend to be a little more logical and with luck will go to Old Manali bridge for ₹50, Hadimba Temple for ₹60 or Vashisht for ₹70. But they'll get more out of you if they can, especially after dark (if you can get one at all).
Around Manali
Vashisht
%01902 / Pop 1600
About 2km north of Manali on the slopes above the Beas River, Vashisht village is a slightly quieter and more compact version of Old Manali and a popular travellers’ hang-out. Indian tourists mostly come to bathe in the hot springs and tour the temples, while foreign travellers largely come for the cheap accommodation, chilled atmosphere and charas. Many guesthouses and restaurants close down from about November to April.1 Sights & Activities

WALKING
For a pretty walk of about an hour each way, head to the school built over a stream at the north end of Vashisht, and take the path up to the right along its far wall. This leads through woods and across a second stream to a small temple beside a third stream (1km from the school). From here it's 20 or 30 minutes uphill to the pretty and quite powerful waterfall.

Freedom, a little away from the main pack and standing on stilts to bring it up to road level, has the best views of all the traveller cafes, plus decently prepared fare and friendly service. Good for an early breakfast, too.
8 Getting There & Away The regular autorickshaw fare to or from Manali is ₹70; don’t rely on being able to get one in either direction after 7pm. On foot it’s about 30 minutes; a footpath down beside Bike Rentals Manali comes out on the main road about 250m north of the Vashisht turn-off.
Solang Nullah
%01902
From January to March, skiers and snowboarders can enjoy 1.5km of alpine- style runs here, 13km north of Manali, taking the recently installed cable car
(Ropeway, Gondola; ₹500 one-way or return; h10am-6.30pm) up to 3200m (the cable car
operates in all seasons). Solang is also a year-round ‘beauty spot’, with paragliding, zorbing, quad bikes and a general carnival-like atmosphere in summer. The surrounding hills are good for walking – Patalsu peak (4472m) to the north is an excellent if quite strenuous one-or two-day hike.
If you want to stay, go for Hotel Iceland (%256008; www.icelandsolang.com; r ₹2120- 4110), a genuine ski lodge with great rooms, equipment rental and a restaurant, and off-season discounts of 20% to 40%.
Buses to Solang Nullah (₹20, one hour) leave Manali's bus station at 8am, 9.30am, 2pm and 4pm, heading back immediately on arrival. Snow may make the road impassable in January and February, which usually means taking a jeep or walking the 3km up from Palchan village on the highway.
WESTERN HIMACHAL PRADESHWESTERN HIMACHAL PRADESH
Western Himachal Pradesh is most famous as the home of the Tibetan government-in-exile and residence of the Dalai Lama, near Dharamsala, but consider travelling further afield to the fascinating Chamba Valley.

When travellers talk of heading up to Dharamsala (to see the Dalai Lama…), this is where they mean. Around 4km north of Dharamsala town – or 10km via the looping bus route – McLeod Ganj is the residence of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama and the site of the Tibetan exile community's main temple. The Tibetan government-in-exile is based just downhill at Gangchen Kyishong, and McLeod is home to a large Tibetan population, including many monks and nuns. It's also, along with Manali, one of the two big traveller hang-outs in Himachal Pradesh, where thousands of people come each year to volunteer with the Tibetan community, take courses in Buddhism, meditation or yoga, trek in the lofty and beautiful Dhauladhar mountains, or just hang out and enjoy the low-budget spiritual and alternative vibe. McLeod has many budget hotels and guesthouses, cafes and restaurants offering Indo-Italo-Israeli-Tibetan food (with free, erratic wi-fi), travel agencies and shops selling Tibetan souvenirs, all crammed into just a couple of blocks, like a mini-Kathmandu.
Named after Donald McLeod, Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, McLeod beganlife in the 1850s as a civilian settlement outside the British garrison of Dharamsala. It was devastated by the 1905 Kangra earthquake and sank into obscurity after Independence – until the Dalai Lama arrived to establish his base here in 1960. Since then, McLeod has become a vibrant centre of Tibetan culture and Buddhism. With an interesting mix of travellers, volunteers, maroon-robed monks and nuns, the international dharma crowd and an increasing flow of Indian tourists, you are never far from an interesting conversation here.
The monsoon (late June to early September) is particularly wet here, and warm clothes are useful between November and March. Many shops and businesses close on Monday.McLeod Ganj

The main focus of visiting pilgrims, monks and many tourists, the Tsuglagkhang complex includes the Tsuglagkhang itself (the main Tibetan temple), the Namgyal Gompa and the excellent Tibet Museum.
Tsuglagkhang
BUDDHIST TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
The revered Tsuglagkhang is the exiles’ concrete equivalent of the Jokhang temple in Lhasa and was built in 1969. The central image is a gilded statue of the Sakyamuni Buddha (the name refers to the Buddha's birthplace Sakya). To its left are statues of Avalokitesvara (Chenrezig in Tibetan; the bodhisattva of compassion and Tibet's patron deity), and Padmasambhava, the Indian sage believed to have spread Buddhism in Tibet in the 8th century.
The silver Avalokitesvara is a replica of the 7th-century Avalokitesvara image in the Jokhang temple that was destroyed in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. It contains relics rescued from the destruction and smuggled out of Tibet. The central Sakyamuni is flanked by collections of sacred texts, and on the right-hand wall are paintings of the three early kings credited with bringing Buddhism to Tibet.
Cameras and phones must be left at a counter before the temple entrance.
Kalachakra Temple

Before visiting the Tsuglagkhang itself, pilgrims first visit the Kalachakra Temple on its west side, which contains mesmerising murals of the Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) mandala, specifically linked to Avalokitesvara, of whom the Dalai Lama is a manifestation. Coloured sand mandalas are created here annually on the fifteenth day of the third Tibetan month.

Namgyal Gompa is the monastery in the Tsuglagkhang Complex. You can watch the monks in lively debate in the courtyard from 2pm to 3pm daily except Sunday, sealing points of argument with a foot stamp and theatrical clap of the hands. The Dalai Lama's residence, not open to the public, is on the south side of the courtyard.

Most Tibetan pilgrims make a clockwise kora (ritual circuit) around the outside of the Tsuglagkhang Complex. Take the downhill road to the left at the complex's entrance then follow the prayer-flag-draped path off to the right after 150m. About half way round the 1.5km circuit you pass a collection of chortens, prayer wheels and photos of more than 100 Tibetans who have self-immolated since 2009.

Just 1.5km west of McLeod on the road to Forsyth Ganj, this brooding Gothic church (dating from 1852) is one of the few remaining traces of McLeod's days as a British hill station. It’s open on Sunday mornings for a weekly 10am service. The cemetery contains the graves of many victims of the 1905 earthquake, as well as the rocket-like tomb of the Earl of Elgin, the second Viceroy of India.
TIBETAN EXILES
In October 1950, about a year after Mao Zedong declared the founding of the People’s Republic of China, Chinese troops invaded Tibet. At the time, Tibet was a de facto independent state led by the Dalai Lama, with a hazy, complicated relationship with China. A year later, in October 1951, Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, fell. After resistance simmered for years in the countryside, protests against the Chinese occupation broke out in Lhasa in 1959. As the Chinese army moved against the uprising, it fired upon the Norbulingka, the Dalai Lama’s summer palace. Believing his life or his freedom was at risk, the Dalai Lama secretly fled across the Himalayas to India, where he received asylum.
China says its army was sent to Tibet as liberators, to free Tibetans from feudal serfdom and improve life on the vast high plateau. It hasn’t worked out that way. While the sometimes-quoted figure of 1.2 million Tibetans killed since 1950 is seriouslydisputed, no independent observers question the suffering and human-rights abuses, as well as huge losses to Tibet’s cultural legacy, that have occurred under Chinese occupation. Many Tibetans still risk the dangerous crossing into India. Today there are an estimated 130,000 Tibetans in India, including those born here. Many new arrivals come first to the Dharamsala area, where they find support from their community (over 10,000 strong), their government-in-exile and a legion of NGOs. There are also large Tibetan communities in Karnataka state, where several settlements have been set up since the 1960s.
Yoga, Ayurveda & Massage
McLeod Ganj has dozens of practitioners of holistic and alternative therapies, some reputable and some making a fast buck at the expense of gullible travellers. Adverts for courses and sessions are posted all over McLeod Ganj and in Contact magazine, but talking to other travellers is a better way to find good practitioners. Lha offers reliable Swedish massages with Tibetan herbal oils for ₹1000. The Men-Tsee-Khang Therapy Centre is good for Tibetan massages.
Several of the best-reputed, longest-established yoga and meditation centres are in Dharamkot and Bhagsu, just outside McLeod.

TIBETAN MEDICINE
Traditional Tibetan medicine is a centuries-old holistic healing practice and a popular treatment for all kinds of minor and persistent ailments. Its methods include massages, compresses, bath and steam therapies, pills made from plants and minerals, and diet and lifestyle advice. There are several clinics around town, including the Men-Tsee-Khang
Therapy Centre (

To get a consultation you have to queue up early at the nearby Ashoka Guest House, where the first 45 people in line at 10am receive a token for an appointment three days later. For your appointment, bring a sample of urine, which, along with a quick examination, is all the doctor needs to prescribe the appropriate herbal pills. Many locals and expats swear by his treatments.
Volunteering
McLeod Ganj has more volunteering opportunities than almost anywhere else in India. Some English conversation classes welcome drop-in participants. For other opportunities it's ideal to make contact a couple of weeks in advance; always check out volunteer organisations carefully before agreeing to participate (see Click here for more advice on volunteering). Volunteers generally arrange their own accommodation and meals, though Lha offers homestays with Tibetan families (US$20 per day including breakfast and dinner, minimum one week).
Many organisations seeking volunteers advertise in the free magazine Contact (www.contactmagazine.net); the magazine itself looks for volunteers to help with writing and proofreading.

MEETING THE DALAI LAMA
Meeting the Dalai Lama is a lifelong dream for many travellers and certainly for Buddhists, but private audiences are rarely granted. Put simply, the Dalai Lama is too busy with spiritual duties to meet everyone who comes to Dharamsala. Tibetan refugees are automatically guaranteed an audience, but travellers must make do with the occasional public teachings held at the Tsuglagkhang, normally in September or October and after Losar (Tibetan New Year) in February or March, and on other occasions depending on his schedule. For schedules and just about everything you need to know about His Holiness, check out www.dalailama.com. To attend a teaching, you must
register with your passport and two photos at the Branch Security Office (

 ; %221560; Bhagsu Rd, McLeod Ganj; h9am-1pm & 2-5pm Mon-Fri & 1st Sat
each mth). It's advisable to do this three or four days before the teaching for the best chance of getting in. To get the most out of the teachings bring a cushion and rent a radio and headset for simultaneous translation.C Courses The most reputable schools of yoga and meditation are mainly found in Dharamkot and Bhagsu.

MCLEOD GANJ TO BHARMOUR TREK
This popular five-day route crosses the Indrahar La (4420m) to the Chamba Valley, and can be done in either direction. The pass is normally open from June to early November, but the best months are September and October.
The first day climbs three or four hours to Triund, where there are a couple of simple rest houses and camping spots. The next stage climbs to the alpine meadow of Laka Got (3350m) and then the rocky shelter known as Lahesh Cave (3600m). With an early start the next day, you can cross the Indrahar La – and be rewarded for the tough climb with astounding views – before descending steeply to the meadow campground at Chata Parao.
The track on down to Kuarsi, crossing summer meadows, can be tricky to find in places. On the final day you reach an unpaved road 3km before Lamu. It's 5km down from Lamu to Holi-Chamba road, plied by several buses a day. To continue to Bharmour, take a bus down to Kharamukh and change there.

Around McLeod Ganj
Bhagsu & Dharamkot
%01892
Through pine trees north and east of McLeod lie the neighbouring villages of Bhagsu (officially Bhagsunag) and Dharamkot, more rural and laid-back than McLeod itself, and the abode of choice for many budget travellers and long- stayers – places where you can lounge in cafes, take drumming lessons and yoga classes, and forget there's any trouble in the world. Some of the area's best and most serious yoga and meditation schools are here too.
Dharamkot retains a quiet village vibe, with the scattered houses of upper Dharamkot stretching almost to the little Gallu Devi Temple on the ridge above. Lower Bhagsu, in contrast, is busy with concrete hotels, shops and discos aimed squarely at domestic visitors. Its small, 16th-century Shiva temple (
GOOGLE MAP
 ) has a cold, clean, spring-fed swimming pool in front of it, and
from there it's a 1km walk to Bhagsu waterfall ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), mostimpressive during the monsoon. Two minutes up from the main road in Bhagsu you're back in Backpackerland: upper Bhagsu is very similar to upper Dharamkot, with which it effectively merges. En route, drop into the awesomely
kitsch Vashnu Mata Temple ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), 200m up from the main road,
where you access the inner grotto through a concrete lion's mouth and emerge via the jaws of a crocodile.
2 Activities
There are many good walks in the hills around Dharamkot and Bhagsu.
To reach the little Gallu Devi Temple ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), you can either
walk straight up the path from the top of Dharamkot, or take the track along the left side of the water tank opposite Dharamkot's Himalayan Tea Shop, then turn up a path to the right after 50m. A lovely stone path winds 1km up through the forest to emerge on a jeep track. Head 500m to the right to Gallu Devi, with a couple of cafes and guesthouses nearby and panoramas both north and south.
From Gallu Devi one track leads gently west downhill to Naddi village
(2.5km) and the underwhelming Dal Lake (3km); another heads about 2km north down to a waterfall; and the main track climbs east through rhododendron woods up to the panoramic mountain meadow of Triund (2900m), a walk of about 6km that gains 800m altitude in a strenuous 2½ to three hours. Triund has a couple of simple rest houses and shops, which rent out sleeping bags and places to sleep or camp, and can provide basic meals. An overnight stop gives you the best chance of clear weather, and time to hike one hour up to the teashop and viewpoint at Laka Got (3350m), sometimes called 'Snowline', before heading back down. If you're starting from McLeod Ganj, you have the option of taking an autorickshaw to the Himalayan Tea Shop (₹70), or even a taxi by a rough road to Gallu Devi (₹400).
If you do go down to Dal Lake, it's just a short hop onward to the Tibetan
Children’s Village ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %221348; www.tcv.org.in; hoffice 9am-12.30pm &
1.30-5pm Mon-Fri), which provides free education for nearly 2000 refugee children and lodging for most of them. Visitors are welcome. You can also get there by autorickshaw (₹100) or taxi direct from McLeod Ganj.C Courses

Norbulingka Institute
The wonderful Norbulingka Institute (%9418436410; www.norbulingka.org; local & Tibetan ₹20, tourist ₹50; h9am-5.30pm), 6km southeast of Dharamsala, was established
in 1988 to teach and preserve traditional Tibetan art forms. You can watch artisans at work on woodcarving, metal-statue-making, thangka painting and embroidery on free tours. The shop (www.norbulingkashop.com) sells the centre's expensive but beautiful craftworks, including jewellery, painted boxes and embroidered clothes and cushions, and sales benefit refugee artists. Also setamong the institute's delightful Japanese-influenced gardens are the Deden
Tsuglakhang temple , with a 4m-high gilded Sakyamuni statue, and the
Losel Doll Museum (local & Tibetan/tourist ₹5/20), which uses charming puppet dioramas to illustrate aspects of traditional Tibetan culture. A short walk outside the complex is the Dolmaling Buddhist nunnery, also open to visitors. On Sundays and the second Saturday of each month, the workshops and shop are closed but the rest of the complex is open.
Peaceful and stylish Norling House (%9816646423; www.norbulingkahotels.com; r
₹3640, ste ₹5360; aW) offers comfortable rooms decked out with Buddhist murals and Norbulingka handicrafts, arranged around a sunny atrium. Vegetarian meals and snacks are available at the Hummingbird Cafe (mains ₹150-200; h7am-9pm; W).
To get here, catch a Palampur-bound bus from Dharamsala and get off at Sacred Heart School, Sidhpur (₹7, 15 minutes), from where it’s a 1km gentle uphill walk (or ₹80 taxi ride). A taxi from McLeod Ganj costs ₹400/600 one- way/return.
Sidhbari
The Gyuto Tantric Gompa (%01892-235307; www.kagyuoffice.org; h9am-6pm) at
Sidhbari, just north of the Palampur road 7km from Dharamsala, is the adopted home of Ogyen Trinley Dorje, who is widely accepted as the 17th Karmapa (leader of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism), who fled from Tibet in 2000. Although the Karmapa's official seat is Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim, he does not reside there owing to a rival claim to the Karmapa title.
When in residence, Ogyen Trinley Dorje gives half-hour public audiences on Wednesday and Saturday at 2.30pm; foreign visitors are welcome but security is tight: bring your passport and be ready to leave bags, phones and cameras outside the auditorium. Gyuto monks are famous for their deep-throated chanting and have performed at Glastonbury Festival, the Sydney Opera House and elsewhere.
Frequent Dharamsala–Palampur buses pass through Sidhbari (₹8, 20 minutes), or you can take a taxi from McLeod Ganj (₹650 return).Southwest of Dharamsala
Kangra
%01892 Pop 9500 Elev 734m
Once capital of the princely state of Kangra, this bustling town 18km from Dharamsala is a good day trip from McLeod Ganj. Hindus visit to pay homage at the Brajeshwari Devi Temple , one of the 51 Shakti peeths, temples on the sites where body parts from Shiva's first wife, Sati, fell after the goddess was consumed by flames (this temple marks the final resting place of her left breast). It's reached through an atmospheric bazaar winding 10 minutes up from the main road, 1km south of the bus stand.
At the south end of town, a ₹100 autorickshaw ride from the bus stand, the
impregnable-looking Kangra Fort (www.royalkangra.com; Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, audio
guide ₹150; hdawn-dusk) soars on a high outcrop between the Manjhi and Banganga Rivers. At least 1000 years old, the fort was occupied by Hindu rajas, Mughal and Sikh conquerors and even the British (from 1846), before it was finally toppled by the 1905 Kangra earthquake. Head up to the palace area at the top for views north to the mountains and south to the plains.
About 200m up the road from the fort is the Maharaja Sansar Chand
Museum (%265866; Indian/foreigner ₹30/100, audio guide ₹150; h9am-5pm), whose
peacock-feather fans, pashmina fly whisks and pretty Kangra School miniatures give a fine insight into the lifestyle of the erstwhile Kangra royal family, the Katochs – a dynasty so ancient that early members supposedly fought against the Pandavas of the Mahabharata.
Kangra hotels are dreary. Best is Hotel Grand Raj (%260901;
www.hotelthegrandraj.com; Dharamshala Rd; r ₹1870-5390; a), opposite the bus station, with a
good restaurant, though the cheapest rooms are small and can be stuffy and
noisy. Hotel Abhi Residency (%261208; Hoshiarpur Rd; r ₹1200-2800; W), 600m
south along the main road from the temple bazaar street, has sizeable, acceptably comfortable rooms with grubby walls.8 Getting There & Away Buses run about every 30 minutes to Dharamsala (₹25, one hour), Palampur (₹50, 1½ hours) and Pathankot (₹125, three hours). Six trains a day in each direction pull into Kangra Mandir station, 2km east of the Brajeshwari Temple.
A return taxi from McLeod Ganj to Kangra Fort costs ₹1400, including waiting time.
KANGRA VALLEY TOY TRAIN
Lumbering narrow-gauge trains run east from Pathankot, providing a scenic if slow route to Kangra (2½ hours), Palampur (four hours), Baijnath (seven hours) and Jogindernagar (nine hours). There are six trains a day – two as far as Jogindernagar and four as far as Baijnath. Ordinary trains cost ₹35 or less to any destination, but carriages are generally packed and seats cannot be booked in advance. Board early to grab a window seat and enjoy the views.
Masrur
Winding roads through pleasant green hills lead 31km southwest from Gaggal to the impressive 10th-century temples (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; hdawn-dusk) at Masrur. Though badly damaged by the 1905 earthquake, the elaborately carved sandstone sikharas – very rare examples of rock-cut temples in northern India – bear more than a passing resemblance to the Hindu temples at Angkor Wat in Cambodia or to Ellora in Maharashtra. The tank in front provides photogenic reflections.
The easiest way to get here is a taxi day-trip (₹1600 return from McLeod Ganj, or ₹2000 combined with Kangra). Alternatively you can reach Lunj (₹65, 1½ hours) from Dharamsala by bus, then take a Nagrota Surian–bound bus 4km southwest to the junction at Pir Bindli, then either walk the last 2.5km or wait for one of the hourly buses to the temples.
Dharamsala to Mandi
The scenery along the Kangra Valley is dramatic, with the Dhauladhar Rangerising to the north, and the wide valley sweeping away southward towards the plains. There are a few interesting places to stop, and a couple of good top-end
hotels where car travellers might break a journey.
Palampur
%01894
About 35km southeast of Dharamsala, Palampur is a bustling little market town
surrounded by tea plantations and rice fields. You can take a free 20-minute tour
to observe the tea-making process at the Palampur Tea Cooperative
Factory (%239034; h10am-5pm), 1.5km south of the bus station on the Kangra
road. Norwood Green (%9736031300; www.norwoodgreen.in; Bundla Tea Estate, Lohna village;
r half-board ₹8000-9000; W), in the north of town, comprises four bright,
contemporary and tasteful cottages, each with four very comfy, sparkling clean
rooms, and a nice sitting/dining area opening out onto a garden terrace – but in
busy seasons they'll only take bookings for two rooms or more. From Palampur's
bus station, 1km south of the centre, buses leave all day for Dharamsala (₹50,
two hours) and Mandi (₹150, 3½ hours). Palampur is also a stop on the
Pathankot–Jogindernagar railway.
Taragarh & Tashijong
About 12km past Palampur towards Mandi is Taragarh Palace (%01894-242034,
in Delhi 011-24692317; www.taragarh.com; r ₹5880-8220; as), the summer palace of the last
maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. It's now a luxury hotel on an estate full of
camphor trees and equipped with a tennis court, an open-air pool, a spa and even
a small polo ground. The Heritage Wing is the more atmospheric, but rooms in
the modern Palace Wing are more comfortable and also stylish.
A side-road 1km past Taragarh leads 1km north to the impressive Tashijong
Gompa , founded by lamas from Tibet's important Khampagar Monastery.
Visitors can see several mural-filled prayer halls and a carpet-making, thangka-
painting and woodcarving cooperative.
Baijnathj
High above the Binwa River at Baijnath, 51km southeast of Dharamsala, the
exquisitely carved 13th-century Vaidyanath Temple is sacred to Shiva in his
incarnation as Vaidyanath, Lord of the Physicians. Thousands of pilgrims make
their way here for the Shivaratri Festival (hlate Feb-early Mar). Plenty of buses
between Mandi and Palampur or Dharamsala stop at Baijnath bus station, almost
opposite the temple. Baijnath Paprola station on the Pathankot–Jogindernagar
railway is 2km west.
Bir & Billing
From Ahju, 8km southeast of Baijnath, a road winds 3km uphill to the village of
Bir (1500m). Bir has three peaceful gompas that welcome passing visitors, and
a handful of guesthouses catering mainly to people who come for the
paragliding and hang-gliding from Billing (2600m), an internationally
renowned take-off point 14km up a winding road from Bir. Experienced
paragliders may fly as far as Dharamsala or Manali from Billing, and
international competitions take place here every autumn. In 2015 Billing is
hosting its first Paragliding World Cup (24 to 31 October).
Several agencies in Bir offer tandem flights of around 30 minutes for ₹2500
to ₹3000, including transport up to Billing. McLeod Ganj travel agencies will
also bring you here for flying. October and November have the best conditions.
The monsoon prevents flying from mid-July to mid-September.
Most buses between Palampur and Mandi will drop you in Ahju.
Alternatively, head to Jogindernagar, 12km further east, and get a taxi there.
Chamba Valley
The scenic Chamba Valley is a splendidly isolated valley system, cut off from
the Kangra Valley by the Dhauladhar Range and from Lahaul and Kashmir by
the Pir Panjal. This area was ruled for centuries as the princely state of Chamba,
one of the most ancient states in North India. It's great for temple buffs and
trekkers, but well off most tourists' radars.Dalhousie
%01899 Pop 10,500 Elev 2036m
With its plunging pine-clad valleys and distant mountain views, Dalhousie is another of those cool hill retreats left behind by the British. Founded in the 1850s by the viceroy whose name it bears, its heyday came in the 1920s, '30s and '40s when Lahore society flocked here for its hols. Come Partition, Lahore found itself in Pakistan, and Dalhousie has never been quite the same again. Still, it carries on as a relatively staid escape for honeymooners and families from the plains.
There's not a lot to see or do except stroll the tree-shaded lanes. Unusually for a hill station there are few truly steep roads. The market areas at Subhash Chowk and Gandhi Chowk are linked by lanes – Thandi Sarak (Cold Rd), and Garam Sarak (Hot Rd). The latter lane receives more sunshine. There's a nice 2.5km road walk northeast from Gandhi Chowk to Jandrighat , a summer home of the former Chamba rulers (not open to visitors). You can also visit the British-era
churches of St John (

BUS
For long-distance services, there are more options from Banikhet, a junction town 7km west (bus/taxi ₹8/220), though you aren't guaranteed a seat there.
Four buses run from Dalhousie's bus stand ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) to Chamba (₹80,
2½ hours) between 9am and 10.30am, two going via Khajjiar (₹40, one hour).
Buses head to Dharamsala (₹250, six hours) at 7.15am, 11am and 1.45pm, andto Pathankot (₹100, three hours) eight times daily.
TAXI
There are taxi stands at the bus stand, Subhash Chowk and Gandhi Chowk. From the bus stand, you’ll pay ₹100 to Subhash Chowk and ₹150 to Gandhi Chowk. Out-of-town fares may differ from one stand to another and the bus station stand was quoting the lowest rates at research time, including ₹520/720 (one-
way/return) to Lakkar Mandi, ₹1130 to Chamba, ₹2500 to Dharamsala and ₹1550 for a day trip to Kalatop, Dhainkund and Khajjiar (₹2050 with a drop at Chamba).
Around Dalhousie
Kalatop Khajjiar Wildlife Sanctuary
This sanctuary covers 31 sq km of forested hills east of Dalhousie. From the impoverished settlement of Lakkar Mandi, 12km from Dalhousie, a flat 3km unpaved road leads to the forest rest house (built in 1925) and tea shops at Kalatop, making for a nice forest walk. You have a chance of spotting langurs and musk deer. There's a ₹200 charge for vehicles to drive this track.
About 10km further down the road towards Chamba, the large, pine-ringed meadow at Khajjiar might be serene when it's not thronged by day-trippers and horse-ride hawkers. Half a kilometre on down the road, an enormous, recently erected 25m-high state of Shiva towers over the little Jagdamba Mata Temple .
Buses from Dalhousie to Chamba via Khajjiar stop at Lakkar Mandi (₹15, 30 minutes). Chamba–Dalhousie buses pass through Khajjiar at about 8.30am, 2.30pm and 3.30pm, and Lakkar Mandi about 20 minutes later.
Dhainkund
More uplifting than Kalatop or Khajjiar is the upland area Dhainkund (2745m), reached by a 4km side-road (and more direct shortcut paths) looping up from Lakkar Mandi. Taxis have to park at a military barrier, from which a scenic1.5km ridgeline walk leads to the Jai Pohlani Mata Temple , with a teahouse and great views of the Pir Pinjal range. The scenic trail continues 5km along the ridge to tiny Jot, with a couple of dhabas, at the Chuari Pass (2772m) on the Chamba–Chuari Khas road. A taxi from Dalhousie to Dhainkund costs around ₹800 return.
Chamba
%01899 Pop 20,000 Elev 996m
Ensconced in the valley of the fast-flowing Ravi River, the capital of Chamba district is a beguiling old town with some beautiful temples, a good museum and bustling markets. Chamba was founded in AD 920 when Raja Sahil Varman moved his capital here from Bharmour, and it remained capital of the Chamba kingdom until merged with India in 1947, though under British control from 1846.
Chamba's de facto centre is the fine, open grassy field known as the Chowgan, a focus for festivals, cricket games, picnics and general hanging out. Every year since 935, Chamba has celebrated the harvest with the Minjar Festival in honour of Raghuvira (an incarnation of Rama) – nowadays a week of processions, folk dance and music, and a vast flea market on the Chowgan.Chamba

Standing on a rise at the top of the Dogra Bazar, this superb line of six beautiful stone sikharas, covered in carvings, dates from the 10th to the 19th centuries. The largest (and oldest), is dedicated to Lakshmi Narayan (Vishnu). The others, in north-to-south order, are sacred to Radha Krishna, Chandergupta, Shiva, Trimukeshwara and Lakshmi Damodar. All are topped by protective wooden canopy roofs.
Just outside the complex entrance is a distinctive Nepali-style pillar topped by a statue of Vishnu’s faithful servant, the man-bird Garuda.

A steep 378 steps up from near the bus stand (or take a taxi), the Chamunda
Devi Temple (

 ), dating from 1762, affords wonderful
views over the town and valley. It's dedicated to a wrathful aspect of the mother goddess Devi and its front mandapa (pavilion) features a forest of bells and rich ceiling carving. About 500m north along the road is the small, modern Sui
Mata Shrine (

 ), with colourful paintings telling the tale of
the Chamba queen Sui, who gave her life to appease a water spirit that was
causing a terrible drought. The queen-goddess is highly venerated by localwomen, and the four-day Sui Mata Mela is celebrated on the Chowgan in her honour each March or April.
About 600m further along the same road, a small red-and-white roadside arch leads to the exquisite 12th-century sikhara-style Bajreshwari Devi Temple (

8 Getting There & Away A mix of government-run HRTC and private buses runs to most destinations from the bus stand. For the spectacular trip to Bharmour (₹90, 3½ hours) buses leave about hourly till about 5pm; sit on the left for the best views and be prepared for delays during monsoon landslides. Eight buses daily head to Dalhousie (₹80, 2½ hours), with three going via Khajjiar (₹40, 1½ hours). At least 12 buses run to Pathankot (₹160, six to seven hours). For Dharamsala (₹200, eight hours) there are three government buses; alternatively, get a government or private bus to Gaggal (₹180, seven hours), from where buses leave every few minutes to Dharamsala (₹15, 40 minutes). For the best scenery, try to get one going via Jot, over the 2772m Chuari Pass.
Taxis at the Court Rd stand charge around ₹1800 to go to Bharmour or Dalhousie and ₹3500 to Dharamsala. You can negotiate.
Bharmour
%01895 Pop 2000 Elev 2195m
Hovering on the edge of the seemingly bottomless Budil Valley, Bharmour is reached by a mountain road as scenic as it is perilous, winding 60km east of Chamba (it gets really interesting once you leave the Ravi Valley at Kharamukh). This ancient settlement was the area capital until replaced by Chamba in AD 920, and there are some beautiful old temples, though the main reason to come here is for treks to the surrounding valleys and passes. The villages around Bharmour are home to communities of seminomadic Gaddis, pastoralists who move their flocks to alpine pastures during the summer, and return here (or to the Kullu or Kangra Valleys) in winter.1 Sights & Activities
Chaurasi Temples
HINDU TEMPLE
 
The Chaurasi temples, 500m up the street from the bus stand, occupy a wide flagstone courtyard that doubles as an outdoor classroom and cricket ground. There are three main Shaivite temples, plus a couple of dozen smaller temples and shrines. The central Manimahesh Temple is a classic stone sikhara, built in the 7th century AD. The squat Lakshna Devi Temple , just inside the entrance, is of a similar date and features a weathered but wildly carved wooden doorway.
For the best valley views, hike 3km up from the Chaurasi entrance to the Brahmani Mata Temple above town. The route passes through the upper village, still full of traditional slate-roofed, wooden houses.
Trekking
The trekking season lasts from May to late October, though July and August see some monsoon rain. The many possible treks include: from Kugti to Jhalma in Lahaul over the 5040m Kugti Pass (five days); from Lamu in the Ravi Valley to McLeod Ganj over the 4420m Indrahar La (five days); and demanding longer treks via the isolated village of Bara Bhangal to Manali or Bir.
A popular shorter trek is to the sacred lake at Manimahesh, a three-day, 35km return hike starting at Hadsar, 13km east of Bharmour. It can be done without a tent thanks to the many dhabas en route. In August/September, thousands of pilgrims take a freezing dip in Manimahesh Lake as part of the Manimahesh Yatra in honour of Lord Shiva (leaving a sad trail of litter behind them).

You can’t miss this red multistorey building up the street towards the Chaurasi temples. Rooms are generous-sized and many have soaring views, but TLC is seriously lacking. The ground-floor restaurant (mains ₹80 to ₹180) is Bharmour's best, which isn't saying much.
8 Information There's an SBI ATM (Temple Rd) on the street below the Chaurasi temples.
8 Getting There & Away Buses leave about hourly from 6am to 5pm for the rugged trip to Chamba (₹90, 3½ hours). Taxis charge between ₹1200 and ₹1800.
A bus to Dharamsala (₹300, 12 hours) departs at 5.30pm. At least five daily buses head to Hadsar (₹35, one hour); the 10.30am and 2pm departures continue to Dhanoul, halfway from Hadsar to Kugti. For buses up the Ravi Valley as far as Holi, take a Chamba-bound bus to Kharamukh and change there.
LAHAUL & SPITI
The vast, desolate northern and eastern tracts of Himachal Pradesh are among the most spectacular and sparsely populated regions on earth. Crossing the Rohtang La from Manali, you arrive first in Lahaul's relatively green Chandra Valley, but if you then travel east into Spiti you pass into the rain shadow of the Great Himalaya Range. Spiti is 7000 sq km of snow-topped mountains and high- altitude desert punctuated by tiny patches of greenery and villages ofaltitude desert, punctuated by tiny patches of greenery and villages of whitewashed houses clinging to the sides of rivers and melt-water streams. As in Zanskar and Ladakh, Buddhism is the dominant religion, though there are pockets of Hinduism in Lahaul.
From Manali, a seasonal highway runs north to Keylong, the capital of Lahaul, over the Rohtang La (3978m), which is normally open from about mid- May to early November. From Keylong the road to Ladakh continues over the mighty Baralacha La (4950m) and Taglang La (5328m) and is normally open from about early June to some time in October, though government buses stop running in mid-September (private buses, minibuses and jeeps continue longer). From Lahaul other roads branch west to the Pattan Valley and east to Spiti over the Kunzum La (4551m), which is open from about mid-June to mid-October. When the passes are closed, Lahaul is virtually cut off from the outside world, and Spiti is connected only by the rugged road from the south through Kinnaur. Check the status of the passes before visiting late in the season – once the snows arrive, you might be stuck for the winter! The website www.bcmtouring.com has updates.
A new tunnel being constructed between the Solang Valley, just north of Manali, and Teling in Lahaul, will bypass the Rohtang La and open Lahaul to year-round traffic. The hoped-for completion date is 2017.
For more information on Lahaul and Spiti, visit the local government website www.hplahaulspiti.gov.in.
History Buddhism is believed to have arrived in Spiti and Lahaul during the 8th century AD with the legendary Indian sorcerer-sage-missionary Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan) who spread Buddhism in Tibet. In the 10th century, upper Lahaul, Spiti, Zanskar and Ladakh were incorporated into the vast Guge kingdom of western Tibet, with Lahaul and Spiti eventually being ruled from Ladakh. The Great Translator, Ringchen Zangpo, founded a series of centres of Buddhist learning in Spiti, including Tabo, one of the most remarkable Buddhist monasteries inthe Indian Himalaya.
The Kullu rajas took control of Lahaul in the 16th century and established a loose hold over Spiti in the 17th. The region came under British control following the 1846 Anglo-Sikh War, yet it maintained strong links with Tibet right up until the Chinese invasion there in 1950.
Recent decades have seen a resurgence in the region's cultural and religious life, aided by the work of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala. Many gompas in Lahaul and Spiti have been restored, and money from tourism and hydroelectricity is improving living conditions for the farming communities who get snowed in here each winter.
1 Climate Rainfall is minimal, especially in Spiti, and the high altitude ensures low temperatures. Winter temperatures can plummet below -30°C, but on the plus side, summer daytime temperatures often rise into the 20s, and when monsoons are soaking the rest of the state (mid- July to mid-September), it’s usually dry and sunny here. Whenever you travel, bring some clothing for cold weather.
Lahaul
Lahaul is greener and a touch more developed than Ladakh or Spiti, but many travellers whistle straight through on the road between Manali and Leh, missing most of what Lahaul has to offer. The capital, Keylong, is an easy stop and you can detour to mountain villages and medieval monasteries that remain blissfully untouched by mass tourism.
ROHTANG RULES
Northbound vehicles, including motorbikes, require a permit to go beyond Gulaba on the way up to the Rohtang La. Drivers can obtain the permit (₹50) at either of two
checkpoints – one just north of Manali ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) on the Rohtang road and theother at Gulaba itself – on production of their driver's licence, the vehicle registration document and the vehicle's pollution control certificate. Some Manali travel agencies, including Himalayan Extreme Centre, will obtain the permit for you in advance for a small fee.
The pass is closed on Tuesdays to all private northbound traffic, including taxis, to facilitate maintenance work.
Southbound vehicles are exempt from both these rules.
Manali to Keylong
From Manali the road strikes north along the Beas River and climbs slowly through pine forests and endless switchbacks to the bare rocky slopes below the spectacular Rohtang La . The name literally translates as ‘pile of dead bodies’ – hundreds of travellers have frozen to death here over the centuries. In the height of summer, the pass is chock-a-block with Indian tourists riding horses and enjoying the novelty of a snowball fight. At the pass, look out for the small, dome-shaped temple that marks the source of the Beas River.
Once over the pass, the road deteriorates rapidly as it plunges down into Lahaul's awe-inspiring Chandra Valley, a rugged landscape of soaring crags, alpine meadows and mesmerising waterfalls plunging from glacial heights. After a zigzagging 14km, Gramphu (three or four stone buildings and a tiny dhaba) marks the turn-off to Spiti. Khoksar, in the valley bottom 5km past Gramphu, has more dhabas. The road passes along the sheer-sided valley, hemmed in by skyscraping rocky peaks. The planned tunnel bypassing the Rohtang La will join this road about 5km west of Khoksar.
About 18km before Keylong, Gondhla is famous for its seven-storey tower fort, built from alternating layers of stone and timber. The fort is no longer occupied, but it’s still an impressive sight. Try to visit during the lively Gondla Fair in July. A strenuous but marvellous day hike leads from Keylong to Gondla over the 4405m Rangcha La; a guide is not essential, but Brokpa Adventure Tours can supply one for ₹1000.
At Tandi, 7km before Keylong, the Chandra River is joined by the Bhaga River (together they become the Chandra-Bhaga). Tandi's petrol station is the last for 365km on the Ladakh road. You can walk 15 minutes up to TupchilingGompa and ask there for the keys to Guru Ghantal Gompa , a further hour's walk, which is the oldest monastery in Lahaul, allegedly founded by Padmasambhava. Although crumbling, the gompa contains ancient murals and unusual wooden statues of bodhisattvas.
Keylong
%01900 Pop 1150 Elev 3350m
Keylong stretches along the north side of the green Bhaga Valley just below the Manali–Leh road, and it’s an overnight stop for many buses plying that route. Many travellers only see Keylong briefly and in the dark, but a longer stay reveals grand mountain views, a laid-back small-town lifestyle and some scenic walks.
The main street, optimistically named the Mall, winds for 1km below and roughly parallel to the highway, with the bus station (New Bus Stand) just above its east end. For tips on day hikes or to arrange longer treks to Zanskar, talk to
Amar at Brokpa Adventure Tours (%9418165176; www.brokpatreks.com; Hotel Dupchen Bldg, the Mall; internet/wi-fi per hr ₹60; h9am-8pm May-Jun & Sep, 7am-10pm Jul & Aug; W), which
also has public internet service.
At the west end of the Mall is the sort-of-interesting Lahaul & Spiti Tribal Museum (h10am-1.30pm & 2-5pm Tue-Sun), with examples of a thod-pa (part of a skull formerly used by amchis or lamas to store healing or sacred liquids), old dance masks, historical photos and prints, and contemporary shots of the local monasteries.

8 Information There's an SBI ATM at the east end of the Mall.
8 Getting There & Away From mid-June to mid-September, an HRTC bus departs for Leh (₹600, about 14 hours) at 4.30am – book tickets at the bus station the day before. Privately operated minibuses and shared jeeps run until October, depending on snow conditions: one place you can book seats is Brokpa Adventure Tours. Seats can cost as much as ₹2000 in the peak season (June to August), and as little as ₹800 at the end of the season.
The HRTC also runs seven daily buses to Manali (₹170, seven hours) from mid-May to mid-November, seven to Udaipur (₹80, three hours) in the Pattan Valley from April/May to November, and three to Chika (₹50, two hours) in the Darcha Valley, jumping-off point for the Shingo La trek into Zanskar, from May to mid-November – road conditions permitting in all cases. For Kaza, take an early Manali bus and change at Gramphu (₹70, 2½ hours); the bus from Manali to Kaza pulls in around 8am.Around Keylong
Shashur Gompa
BUDDHIST MONASTERY
 
About 3km (one hour of uphill walking) above Keylong, Shashur Gompa was founded in the 17th century by the Zanskari lama Deva Gyatsho. The original gompa, featuring 5m-high thangkas, is now enshrined inside a modern concrete one, with fine views over the valley. During the Tsheshu Festival in June or July, monks here perform frenetic ritual masked dances known as chaams.
The path to the gompa cuts uphill almost opposite the Yarkid Guesthouse on the main highway – follow it upwards until you see the white chortens visible on the ridge.
Kardang Gompa
BUDDHIST MONASTERY
 
Propped on concrete stilts facing Keylong across the valley, Kardang Gompa has existed for 900 years, but the current building dates from 1912. Maintained by an order of Drukpa Kagyu (Red Hat) monks and nuns, the monastery enshrines a mighty prayer wheel said to contain a million strips of paper bearing the mantra Om mani padme hum ('hail to the jewel in the lotus'). There are excellent frescoes, but you may have to track down a monk or nun to open the doors.
To get here, head for the hospital at the bottom of the west end of Keylong and take a path down to the left 30m before the hospital. This crosses the Bhaga on a footbridge, then climbs 1km to a road where you turn right into Kardang village. Ask directions to the gompa, 800m further uphill. For a different route back, return to Kardang village then head to the right along the road for 3km to Lapchang village, where a path descends 1km to another footbridge over the Bhaga, then climbs 1.25km to the main road. Keylong is 1.5km to the left (west).
Jispa
About 22km northeast of Keylong, pretty Jispa village is a popular overnight stop for mountain bikers and motorcyclists; 4km back towards Keylong is the16th-century Gemur Gompa . For accommodation, there’s the inviting Hotel
Ibex Jispa (%01900-233203; www.hotelibexjispa.com; d ₹2120) on the main road. There
are several alternative overnight halts further up the road towards Leh.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
PATTAN VALLEY
At Tandi, 8km southwest of Keylong, a road branches northwest along the beautiful, green Pattan Valley, Lahaul's lowest-lying, most fertile area, carved by the Chandra- Bhaga River. Snowy peaks rise above its many side valleys, and passes over the Pir Panjal range to the south lead across to the Chamba Valley.
Around 36km from Tandi, a side road leads 5km to the hilltop village of Triloknath, whose squat stone temple is a remarkable example of Hindu-Buddhist syncretism: the white-marble main idol is revered by Buddhists as Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva of compassion, while Hindus worship it as Shiva. It’s a major pilgrimage site for both religions, especially during the Pauri Festival (h3rd week of Aug).
Pattan's largest settlement is the little town of Udaipur, 46km from Tandi – a slow- paced spot with a few basic lodgings including Youngpha Guesthouse (r without bath
₹300-400), with four clean, carpeted rooms. Udaipur's Markula Devi Temple looks plain on the outside, but the inside is covered with fabulous, detailed wood carvings from the 11th to 16th centuries, including scenes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana around the top of the walls.
From Udaipur the road continues down the valley to Killar, beyond which unpaved roads head over the Sach Pass (open roughly mid-June to mid-October) to Chamba and on down to Kishtwar in Jammu and Kashmir.
Spiti
Separated from fertile Lahaul by the soaring 4551m Kunzum La, Spiti is another chunk of Tibet marooned in India. The scattered villages in this serrated moonscape arrive like mirages, clusters of whitewashed mud-brick homes huddled amid green barley fields below monasteries perched on crags a thousand feet above. The turquoise-grey ribbon of the Spiti River is your near-constant companion, running along a fairly broad valley before turning south at Sumdo into the precipitous gorges of the Hangrang Valley.
In many ways Spiti is even more rugged and remote than Ladakh, but buses do run over the Kunzum La from Manali from mid June to mid October and thedo run over the Kunzum La from Manali from mid-June to mid-October, and the road from Kinnaur is open all year (except for temporary closures for winter snowfall and monsoon landslides and floods). The Spiti–Kinnaur loop is one of Asia's great road trips, and a steady stream of motorcyclists, mountain bikers and drivers of all kinds of four-wheelers pit themselves against some of the most challenging roads in India.
In either direction, an inner line permit is required for the stretch between Sumdo, east of Tabo, and the Akpa checkpoint east of Rekong Peo.
Gramphu to Kaza
From Gramphu, the road to Spiti runs up the dramatic, glacier-carved Chandra Valley. The tiny settlements of Chatru and Batal have popular dhabas. One kilometre past Batal, a rough track runs north to lovely Chandratal (Moon Lake), a tranquil glacial lake among snow peaks at 4270m. The track ends after 12km and a footpath runs the final 1km to the lake. From June to mid-October you can stay in tent camps 3km before the end of the track, among them Jamaica's
Camp (%9418200183; http://travelspiti.com; per person incl meals ₹1000), offering cosy two-
person tents and a friendly welcome. From Chandratal, trekkers can reach the Baralacha La on the Manali–Leh road in three strenuous but heavenly days. Batal is also the starting point for treks to Bara Shigri (Big Glacier), one of the longest glaciers in the Himalaya, but the route is treacherous and it’s essential to travel with an experienced guide.
The main road switchbacks precipitously up to the Kunzum La , where vehicles perform a respectful circuit of the stupas strewn with fluttering prayer flags before continuing down into Spiti. An alternative 10.5km footpath to Chandratal starts at the pass.
The first Spitian village of any size is Losar, a cluster of concrete and mud- brick houses, where there’s a passport check and a handful of guesthouses and
dhabas. Friendly Samsong Guesthouse (r without/with bathroom ₹500/700) has
simple but clean rooms and hot meals (and its rates can drop to between₹200 and ₹300 outside the peak season).
The final stretch to Kaza follows the Spiti River, passing the large Yangchen Choling nunnery at Pangmo, and the Sherab Choling monastery school atMorang. Volunteer teaching placements at these schools can be organised through the US-based Jamyang Foundation (www.jamyang.org).
SUSTAINABLE SPITI
While tourism brings money and development to remote areas like Spiti, it can also do unintentional damage to fragile cultures and ecosystems, and local communities may receive few of its benefits. Recognising this, a number of villages have partnered with Ecosphere (%9418860099; www.spitiecosphere.com; Main Bazar, Kaza; hoffice & shop 9am-7pm Mon-Sat May–mid-Oct, 10am-5pm Mon-Sat Apr & mid-Oct–mid-Dec), a Spiti conservation and development NGO, to create a successful home-grown sustainable tourism program.
Homestays (₹600 per night, including meals) have been set up in six villages, five of which (Langza, Komic, Demul, Lhalung and Dhankar) can be linked into a 'Homestay Trail' trekking route. Visitors get a taste of authentic Spitian life, sleeping in traditional whitewashed houses and eating home-cooked food in the family kitchen. From the villages, wildlife-watching hikes offer a chance of spotting ibex, blue sheep (bharal) and possibly the shanku (Himalayan wolf), the world’s oldest wolf species. Trained guides (₹1000 to ₹1800 per day), which are recommended, but not required, explain about the culture and the land. Part of the homestay fee helps support the host family, and part goes into a village fund for activities to benefit the community as a whole, such as restoring the local Buddhist monastery, which is the heart of their cultural life.
Ecosphere also offers travellers numerous other activities including mountain-bike tours, culture or wildlife tours, and a 'day with the nuns' in Spiti's Buddhist convents. If you can, get here in deep winter (February is best) and stay in high-altitude villages above Kaza for seven to 10 days, Ecosphere even offers a 90% chance of seeing snow leopards (₹2500 to ₹4000 per person per day for these trips).
Travellers can contribute to Ecosphere's work by volunteering on a range of projects from working in the Sol Cafe to building year-round greenhouses or working with shepherds, potters or herbal doctors.
Kaza
%01906 Pop 1700 Elev 3640m
The capital of Spiti, Kaza sits on the eroded flood plain of the Spiti River and is the biggest settlement you’ll encounter in this empty corner of the planet. It feels a bit like a small frontier town with an easygoing pace. Jagged mountains rise on either side, while the river coils across the valley floor like twisted locks of Medusa’s hair. The colourful new Sakya Gompa stands just above the mainroad in New Kaza (south of the Kaza Nullah), while the ramshackle bazaar and whitewashed buildings of Old Kaza spread out on the north side of the stream. The bus and taxi stands are at the bottom of the bazaar in Old Kaza.
Most people stay at least one night to arrange the inner line permit for travel beyond Tabo. Kaza is also the starting point for trips to Ki Gompa and the villages of Kibber, Langza, Hikkim and Komic, high on the east side of the
valley. Spiti Holiday Adventure (%9418439247, 222711; www.spitiholidayadventure.com; Main Bazar; h8.30am-8pm or later, Mar-Nov) organises all-inclusive treks in the region,
plus jeep safaris and cultural tours, and is a good place for travel information. In the third week of August, villagers from across Spiti descend on Kaza for
the Ladarcha Fair. All sorts of goods are bought and sold, and traders wear their finest clothes.
4 Sleeping & Eating There are plenty of places to stay in both halves of town. Most close for several months in winter.

INNER LINE PERMITS IN KAZA
To travel between Sumdo in eastern Spiti and Rekong Peo in Kinnaur, foreign travellers need an inner line permit. These are issued for free in around 20 minutes at the Assistant Deputy Commissioner’s Office (%222202; h10am-1.30pm & 2-5pm Mon-Sat, closed 2nd Sat each mth) in New Kaza – the large green-roofed building diagonally opposite the Community Health Centre (hospital). Bring two passport photos and a photocopy of your passport's identity and visa pages, plus an application form (available at Ashoka stationers across the road). Solo travellers have no problems getting permits here.
8 Getting There & Away The bus to Manali (₹300, 11 hours) leaves at 4.30am, mid-June to mid-October; buy tickets when it arrives about 4.30pm the day before. For Keylong, change at Gramphu (₹200, nine hours). A bus leaves for Rekong Peo (₹335, 11 hours) at 7.30am, via Tabo (₹71, 2½ hours) and Nako (₹170, 5½ hours). There’s a second Tabo bus at 3pm.
Shramjeevi Taxi Operators Union (%8988054698), opposite the bus station, has fixed rates everywhere including to Dhankar (₹1450, 1½ hours), Tabo (₹1800, 1½ hours), Keylong (₹8000, eight hours) and Manali (₹8600, eight hours). For return trips with a one-hour wait, add 20%; for each extra hour, add ₹100 more. They also run a shared jeep to Manali (₹800) at 6am most days in season. For shared taxis to Spiti villages, try around lunchtime when villagers are returning home from town.
Around Kaza
The small, high-altitude villages on the east side of the Spiti valley (all well above 4000m) have a pristine, desolate beauty all their own – clusters of whitewashed, flat-roofed houses against a stark mountain backdrop with minimal vegetation except their carefully tended fields of barley and other crops.This is the abode of the Himalayan wolf, snow leopard, blue sheep, golden eagle and griffon vulture. Some of the villages have seasonal guesthouses or homestays and interesting old temples. They make good day trips from Kaza, and equally good places to stay over, take walks or trek between, and get a sense of the lifestyle of their amazingly resilient people.
Ki
About 12km northwest of Kaza, on the road to Kibber, tiny Ki is dominated by the whitewashed buildings of Ki Gompa (h6am-7pm). Set picturesquely atop a conical hillock, this is the largest gompa in Spiti, with around 300 senior and student monks. An atmospheric puja is held in the new prayer hall every morning around 8am. On request, the monks will open up the medieval prayer rooms, including the Zimshung Lhakhang, which houses a bed slept in by the Dalai Lama in 1960 and 2000. Dance masks are brought out for the annual Ki Chaam Festival (Tsheshu Festival; hJun/Jul) and for Losar.
Kibber
About 8km beyond Ki, this relatively large village (4200m) is the trailhead for the demanding nine-to-11-day trek over the 5578m Parang La to Tso Moriri lake in Ladakh (mid-July to mid-September), and also a good base for day hikes. You can walk to the even higher hamlets of Gete (about two hours, with small lakes nearby) or Tashigang (about three hours) or up to panoramic Lama Tsong
Tsong peak (4750m high; six to seven hours round-trip). Chhetan Lama of
Norling Adventure Tours (%8988356455; lamachhetankibber@gmail.com) charges
around ₹3500 per person per day for fully equipped treks, or ₹1000 to ₹1500 to guide day hikes. Kibber has one new and two old temples: the 14th-century one in the main village contains three prayer rooms with ancient wall paintings and sculptures.
Several guesthouses offer rooms and meals. Most close from some time in October to March or April. Easily the best rooms are at solar-powered Norling
Home Stay (%9418556107; r without/with bathroom ₹400/500), a traditional
whitewashed home overlooking most of the village, which also dishes upexcellent organic food. One daily bus to Kibber (₹32, 50 minutes) via Ki (₹23, 30 minutes) leaves Kaza at 5pm, starting back from Kibber at 8.30am. Taxis are ₹900 one-way.
Langza
Langza, a switchback 16km drive north of Kaza, sits at 4325m below the pointed 6300m peak of Chau Chau. A large modern Buddha statue stares across the valley from the top of the village; the temple behind it is around 500 years old. About a half-hour walk away is an area rich in ammonite fossils around 100 million years old. Village men participate in a drunken horse race to Komic and back (or Komic to Langza and back, depending on the year) on a variable date in the first half of August, imbibing large amounts of local homebrews before, during and after the race.

HOMESTAY
This excellent homestay has three rooms with comfy beds, carpets, mud floors, filtered drinking water and solar hot water. Anjaan, the owner, is an experienced, English-speaking guide who can show you local points of interest and take you to look for wildlife.
8 Getting There & Away A bus leaving Kaza at 2pm on Tuesday and Saturday runs to Langza (₹23, one hour) and on to Komic (₹39, 1½ hours), starting back from Komic about 4pm. Taxis from Kaza cost ₹750 to Langza.
Hikkim
About 6km south of Langza on a route to Komic, little Hikkim is home to the world's highest post office (h9-10am & 5-6pm Mon-Sat), 4440m above sea level. It's actually a house, and all customers are offered a cup of tea. If the owners arearound outside official opening hours, they'll probably still sell you some stamps. It's possible to hike direct from Kaza to Hikkim up the Kaza Nullah in three to four hours – steeper and harder, but shorter, than the 15km road route.
Komic
At 4513m, Komic is claimed to be the highest motorable village in Asia. It comprises about 10 houses and, above them, the important Tangyud Gompa , probably founded in the 14th century and with around 50 monks today. Pujas are offered at 8am to Mahakala, a wrathful emanation of Avalokitesvara. Above the fortlike main building, a smaller, older building has a stuffed snow leopard hanging inside the entrance: women are not permitted in its inner prayer rooms. Komic has at least one homestay – ask locally or at Ecosphere.
Taxis from Kaza cost ₹1400 via Langza, or ₹1050 by a shorter but rougher road avoiding Langza. From Komic it's about a 16km walk south to Demul, the next village on the 'Homestay Trail'.
Pin Valley
Southeast of Kaza, the snaking Spiti River is joined by the Pin River, flowing out of a wind-scoured but beautiful valley from the heights of the Great Himalaya Range. The road into the Pin Valley branches off the Tabo road 15km from Kaza. Mud slides at Kirgarang Nullah, 8km along, can block the road, sometimes for weeks, from some time in June, so take soundings before heading into the valley in early summer. Gulling village has a couple of simple guesthouses. At Kungri, 3km above Gulling, the 680-year-old Ugyen Sangnak Choling Gompa has a huge new monastery building and three much more interesting medieval shrines, featuring blackened murals, festival masks and carved wooden snow lions. Women are not allowed inside two of them. Tringon Guest House (r without bathroom ₹450) at the monastery has tolerably clean rooms and a small food shop, but for meals you'll have to go down to Gulling.
The pretty, traditional village of Sagnam marks the turn-off to Mudh (3770m), the trailhead for the spectacular but logistically complicated six-to-nine-day trek to the Parvati Valley over the 5319m Pin-Parvati Pass, and also for the easier four-day trek over the 4850m Bhaba Pass (Tari Khango) to Kaphnu in Kinnaur. Mudh is a beautiful spot to stay a couple of days, even if you're not trekking. The excellent Tara Homestay (%8988062293; www.spititaraadventure.com;
s/d ₹500/600, r without bathroom ₹400, mains ₹80-130; hMay-Oct or Nov; i) is the pick of
several guesthouses, and its owner, Sonam Gialson, can arrange full treks with porters, and other tours including jeep safaris.
A short distance from Mudh on either trek, you enter the 675-sq-km Pin Valley National Park, reputed as the ‘land of ibex and snow leopards’. You may well see ibex (and blue sheep), but you'll be extremely lucky to spot a snow leopard.
Buses to Mudh (₹80, two hours) leave Kaza daily at 4pm, starting back at 6am. Some days there's a shared jeep (₹100 per person) from Mudh at about 6am, returning around 3pm. Kaza taxis charge ₹1800 to Mudh.
Dhankar
High above the confluence of the Spiti and Pin Rivers, a steep 8km walk or drive up from Sichling on the Kaza–Tabo road, Dhankar village is the former capital of the Nono kings who ruled Spiti. The spectacular 1200-year-old Dhankar Gompa (admission ₹25; h8am-7pm) perches precariously between eroded pinnacles on the edge of a cliff. Its top-floor courtyard has a stuffed blue sheep hanging above the stairwell, a room where the Dalai Lama slept, a meditation cave, and a shrine containing ceremonial masks. Another prayer hall stands on the hilltop above, accessed by separate concrete steps. The views from these buildings are phenomenal. Dhankar's lamas no longer inhabit the old gompa, having moved to the large, sparkling New Monastery , 800m away, in 2009. In November they celebrate the Guktor Festival (hNov) with energetic masked dances.
On the hilltop above the gompa are the ruins of the mud-brick fort that sheltered the valley's population during times of war and gave the village its name (khar means 'citadel' and dhak means 'cliff'). An hour’s walk up from the village, the small lake Dhankar Tso offers views over the valley and southeast to the twin peaks of Manirang (6593m).Dhankar Monastery Guesthouse (%9418817761; dm ₹150, r ₹350-800; hApr–
mid-Oct), beside the New Monastery, has a relaxed traveller vibe, a wide choice of good food (mains ₹80 to ₹280) and rooms with picture-postcard views. There are also several homestays, charging ₹500 per person, including two or three
meals. Manirang Home Stay (%8988053409; per person incl breakfast ₹400, with 3 meals
₹500), below the road between the old and new monasteries, offers three pleasant rooms, a nice roof terrace and more great views, and owner Anil Kumar can organise guides, treks and transport.
Buses between Kaza and Tabo pass through Sichling (₹38, one hour from Kaza); a taxi from Kaza is ₹1450/1740 one-way/return. You might find a taxi from Sichling to Dhankar for around ₹400.
Lhalung
Hidden up the Lingti Valley, 12km northeast of Dhankar along a fairly level dirt road, the charming traditional village of Lhalung is worth a detour for its fantastic medieval monastery (admission ₹50). The atmospheric main chapel contains superb old murals and an incredibly ornate carved wooden back frieze. The separate Langkharpo chapel holds a unique four-sided statue of the white deity atop a plinth of snow lions. Don't miss the skin prayer wheel in a side chapel. The village has several homestays charging around ₹500 per person including meals, which you can arrange privately or through Ecosphere.
Tabo
%01906 / Pop 600
Little Tabo, in a dramatic valley setting hemmed in by scree slopes, 48km southeast of Kaza, is the only other town in Spiti. The dull mud-brick walls of Tabo Gompa hide some of the finest of all Indo-Tibetan art, and Tabo makes a fine place to kick back for a couple of days.
1 Sights & Activities
o Tabo Gompa
BUDDHIST MONASTERY(www.tabomonastery.com; donations accepted; h6am-10pm, shrines 9am-5pm)
The gompa was founded in AD 996 by Ringchen Zangpo, the Great Translator, as Tibet's Guge kingdom expanded into these outlying territories, and is reckoned to be the oldest continuously functioning Buddhist monastery in India. Bring a torch as lighting inside its shrines is dim at best. Five of the nine shrines date from the 10th and 11th centuries, when they were painted by some of the best Buddhist muralists of their era, blending Tibetan, Indian and Kashmiri styles.
The other shrines mostly date from the 15th to 17th centuries.
The main assembly hall, the Tsuglkang , is straight ahead from the temple entrance. Inside, near-life-size clay sculptures of 32 bodhisattvas line the walls around a statue of a four-bodied Vairochana Buddha turning the wheel of law – a 3D representation of the Vajradhatu mandala, which has the Vairochana at its centre. Murals below the bodhisattvas depict 10th-century life.
You'll probably have to ask a lama to open up other temples in the compound. The other highlight early temples are the Ser-Khang (Golden Temple), second to the left from the Tsuglkang, with outstanding murals of the green Tara and the goddess Usnishavijaya; the Kyil-Khang (Mystic Mandala Temple), behind the Ser- Khang, with a huge Vairochana mural surrounded by eight bodhisattvas; and the Byams-Pa Chen-po Lha-Khang , immediately right of the Tsuglkang, with a 3m-high statue of the Bodhisattva Maitreya (future Buddha).
The modern gompa outside the ancient compound has a sparkling gilded chorten and holds a well-attended puja at 6.30am (guests welcome).
Caves
 
A number of caves on the hillside above the main road were part of the monastery complex: you can reach them by steps opposite the Vijay Kumar shop.

HOTEL
The impressiveness of the carved wooden doorway doesn't quite extend inside, but the pine-panelled rooms, with good tiled bathrooms, and temple and mountain views, are Tabo's nearest thing to luxury. It's on the main road at the back of town, and is sometimes full with groups. The good restaurant is open to all.
Cafe Kunzum Top

Tabo Cyber Cafe (Kesang Homestay Guest House; per hr ₹80; h9am-8pm Apr, May, Sep, Oct, 7am-9pm Jun-Aug).
8 Getting There & Away Buses to Kaza (₹71, 2½ hours) pass through Tabo around 9am and 3pm, give or take an hour. There’s a daily bus to Rekong Peo (₹270, nine hours) at 9am, via Nako (₹100, three hours), but as this originates in Kaza it can be packed, especially in May and October when seasonal workers are on the move.
Taxis charge around ₹1600 to Kaza, ₹1300 to Dhankar, ₹1700 to Nako and ₹6000 to Rekong Peo.
Tabo to Sumdo
East of Tabo the highway continues to Sumdo, 27km east, where it turns south and enters Kinnaur. Foreigners must show their inner line permits at Sumdo. The southward stretch from here to Rekong Peo is one of India’s most dramatic mountain roads.
If you’ve got your own transport, 3km before Sumdo look for the turn-off toGiu, 8km up a side valley, where you can see the mummified remains of a Buddhist monk who died over 500 years ago. The remains still have hair and fingernails and, according to local lore, spurted blood when unearthed by the shovels of a construction crew in 2004.Agra & the Taj Mahal
Agra & the Taj Mahal Highlights
Agra Around Agra
Agra & the Taj Mahal
Why Go?
Agra’s Taj Mahal rises from the dust-beaten earth of Uttar Pradesh as it does in dreams, but even the wildest imaginations leave travellers underprepared for that breath-stealing moment its gates are traversed and this magnificent world wonder comes into focus. Skipping it would be a bit like drinking chai without spoonfuls of sugar: absurd. Simply put, it's the most beautiful building in the world and it's almost impossible to see it without feeling awestruck.
But Agra, with its long and rich history, boasts plenty more besides. For 130 years this was the centre of India’s great Mughal empire, and its legacy lives on in beautiful artwork, mouth-watering cuisine and magnificent architecture. Theg
g
Taj is one of three places here that have been awarded Unesco World Heritage status, with the immense Agra Fort and the eerie ruined city of Fatehpur Sikri making up a superb trio of top-draw sights.
When to Go
A Sep–Oct The best time to visit. Most of the monsoon rains are over and summer temperatures have cooled.
A Nov–Feb Daytime temperatures are comfortable but big sights are overcrowded. Evenings are nippy.
A Mar–Apr Evening chill is gone but raging-hot midsummer temperatures have yet to materialise.

TOP AGRA FESTIVALS
Taj Mahotsav (www.tajmahotsav.org; hFeb) This 10-day carnival of culture, cuisine and crafts is Agra's biggest and best party. Held at Shilpgram, the festival features over 400 artisan craft-makers from all over India, as well as a pot-pourri of folk and classical music, dances from various regions and enough regional food to induce a curry coma. Kailash Fair (hAug/Sep) Held at the Kailash temple, 12km from Agra, this cultural and religious fair honours Lord Shiva, who legendarily appeared here in the form of a stone lingam. It attracts devotees from all over North India.
Ram Barat (hSep) Celebrated before the Hindu festival of Dussehra, Ram Barat is a dramatic recreation of the royal wedding procession of Shri Rama. Expect three days of colourful lights and pounding Hindu rhythms, highlighted by the 12-hour parade itself, featuring caparisoned elephants, horses, more than 125 mobile floats depicting mythological events and 30 marching bands.
History In 1501 Sultan Sikander Lodi established his capital here, but the city fell into Mughal hands in 1526, when Emperor Babur defeated the last Lodi sultan at Panipat. Agra reached the peak of its magnificence between the mid-16th and mid-17th centuries during the reigns of Akbar, Jehangir and Shah Jahan. During this period the fort, the Taj Mahal and other major mausoleums were built. In 1638 Shah Jahan built a new city in Delhi, and his son Aurangzeb moved the capital there 10 years later.
In 1761 Agra fell to the Jats, a warrior class who looted its monuments,including the Taj Mahal. The Marathas took over in 1770, but were replaced by the British in 1803. Following the First War of Independence (Indian Uprising) in 1857, the British shifted the administration of the province to Allahabad. Deprived of its administrative role, Agra developed as a centre for heavy industry, quickly becoming famous for its chemicals industry and air pollution, before the Taj and tourism became a major source of income.

1 Sights The entrance fee for Agra’s five main sights – the Taj, Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar’s Mausoleum and Itimad-ud-Daulah – is made up of charges from two different bodies, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the Agra Development Association (ADA). Of the ₹750 ticket for the Taj Mahal, ₹500 is a special ADA ticket, which gives you small savings on the other four sights if visited in the same day. You’ll save ₹50 at Agra Fort and ₹10 each at Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar’s Mausoleum and Itimad-ud- Daulah. You can buy this ₹500 ADA ticket at any of the five sights. Just say you intend to visit the Taj later that day.
All the other sights in Agra are either free or have ASI tickets only, which aren’t included in the ADA one-day offer.
Admission to all sights is free for children under 15. On Fridays, many sights offer a tax-free discount of ₹10.

Poet Rabindranath Tagore described it as 'a teardrop on the cheek of eternity', Rudyard Kipling as 'the embodiment of all things pure', while its creator,
E            Sh h J h         id it     d  'th             d th              h d t       f       th iEmperor Shah Jahan, said it made 'the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes'. Every year, tourists numbering more than twice the population of Agra pass through its gates to catch a once-in-a-lifetime glimpse of what is widely considered the most beautiful building in the world. Few leave disappointed.
The Taj was built by Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. The death of Mumtaz left the emperor so heartbroken that his hair is said to have turned grey virtually overnight. Construction of the Taj began the following year and, although the main building is thought to have been built in eight years, the whole complex was not completed until 1653. Not long after it was finished Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son Aurangzeb and imprisoned in Agra Fort where, for the rest of his days, he could only gaze out at his creation through a window. Following his death in 1666, Shah Jahan was buried here alongside Mumtaz.
In total, some 20,000 people from India and Central Asia worked on the building. Specialists were brought in from as far away as Europe to produce the exquisite marble screens and pietra dura (marble inlay work) made with thousands of semiprecious stones.
The Taj was designated a World Heritage Site in 1983 and looks as immaculate today as when it was first constructed – though it underwent a huge restoration project in the early 20th century.
Entry & Information
Note: the Taj is closed every Friday to anyone not attending prayers at the mosque.
The Taj can be accessed through the west, south and east gates. Tour groups tend to enter through the east and west gates. Independent travellers tend to use the south gate, which is nearest to Taj Ganj, the main area for budget accommodation, and generally has shorter queues than the west gate. The east gate has the shortest queues of the lot, but this is because the ticket office is inconveniently located a 1km walk away at Shilpgram, a dire government-run tourist centre. There are separate queues for men and women at all three gates.
Cameras and videos are permitted but you cannot take photographs inside the mausoleum itself, and the areas in which you can take videos are quite limited.
Do not forget to retrieve your free 500mL bottle of water and shoe covers(included in Taj ticket price). If you keep your ticket you get small entry-fee reductions when visiting Agra Fort, Fatehpur Sikri, Akbar's Mausoleum or the Itimad-ud-Daulah on the same day. You can also store your luggage for free beside the ticket offices and pick up an audio guide (₹118).
From the south gate, entry to the inner compound is through a very impressive, 30m red-sandstone gateway on the south side of the forecourt, which is inscribed with verses from the Quran.
Inside the Grounds
Once inside, the ornamental gardens are set out along classical Mughal charbagh (formal Persian garden) lines – a square quartered by watercourses, with an ornamental marble plinth at its centre. When the fountains are not flowing, the Taj is beautifully reflected in the water.
The Taj Mahal itself stands on a raised marble platform at the northern end of the ornamental gardens, with its back to the Yamuna River. Its raised position means that the backdrop is only sky – a masterstroke of design. Purely decorative 40m-high white minarets grace each corner of the platform. After more than three centuries they are not quite perpendicular, but they may have been designed to lean slightly outwards so that in the event of an earthquake they would fall away from the precious Taj. The red-sandstone mosque (

GOOGLE MAP
 ) to the west is an important gathering place for Agra's Muslims.
The identical building to the east, the jawab ( for symmetry.
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), was built
The central Taj structure is made of semitranslucent white marble, carved with flowers and inlaid with thousands of semiprecious stones in beautiful patterns. A perfect exercise in symmetry, the four identical faces of the Taj feature impressive vaulted arches embellished with pietra dura scrollwork and quotations from the Quran in a style of calligraphy using inlaid jasper. The whole structure is topped off by four small domes surrounding the famous bulbous central dome.
Directly below the main dome is the Cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal, an elaborate false tomb surrounded by an exquisite perforated marble screen inlaid with dozens of different types of semiprecious stones. Beside it, offsetting the symmetry of the Taj, is the Cenotaph of Shah Jahan, who was interred herewith little ceremony by his usurping son Aurangzeb in 1666. Light is admitted into the central chamber by finely cut marble screens. The real tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan are in a locked basement room below the main chamber and cannot be viewed.

FORT
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹20/300, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk)
With the Taj Mahal overshadowing it, one can easily forget that Agra has one of the finest Mughal forts in India. Construction of the massive red-sandstone fort, on the bank of the Yamuna River, was begun by Emperor Akbar in 1565.
Further additions were made, particularly by his grandson Shah Jahan, using his favourite building material – white marble. The fort was built primarily as a military structure, but Shah Jahan transformed it into a palace, and later it became his gilded prison for eight years after his son Aurangzeb seized power ing        p                 gy
gp
1658.
The ear-shaped fort’s colossal double walls rise over 20m in height and measure 2.5km in circumference. The Yamuna River originally flowed along the straight eastern edge of the fort, and the emperors had their own bathing ghats here. It contains a maze of buildings, forming a city within a city, including vast underground sections, though many of the structures were destroyed over the years by Nadir Shah, the Marathas, the Jats and finally the British, who used the fort as a garrison. Even today, much of the fort is used by the military and so is off-limits to the general public.
The Amar Singh Gate ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) to the south is the sole entry point
to the fort these days and where you buy your entrance ticket. Its dog-leg design was meant to confuse attackers who made it past the first line of defence – the crocodile-infested moat.
GOOGLE MAP
A path leads straight from here up to the large Moti Masjid ( 
 )
(Pearl Mosque), which is always closed. To your right, just before you reach
Moti Masjid, is the large open Diwan-i-Am ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) (Hall of Public
Audiences), which was used by Shah Jahan for domestic government business, and features a throne room where the emperor listened to petitioners. In front of it is the small and rather incongruous grave of John Colvin, a lieutenant- governor of the northwest provinces who died of an illness in the fort during the 1857 First War of Independence (Indian Uprising).
A tiny staircase just to the left of the Diwan-i-Am throne leads up to a large courtyard. To your left, is the tiny but exquisite Nagina Masjid (Gem Mosque), built in 1635 by Shah Jahan for the ladies of the court. Down below was the Ladies’ bazaar, where the court ladies bought goods.
On the far side of the large courtyard, along the eastern wall of the fort, is Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audiences), which was reserved for important dignitaries or foreign representatives. The hall once housed Shah Jahan’s legendary Peacock Throne, which was inset with precious stones including the famous Koh-i-noor diamond. The throne was taken to Delhi by Aurangzeb, then to Iran in 1739 by Nadir Shah and dismantled after his assassination in 1747. Overlooking the river and the distant Taj Mahal is Takhti-i-Jehangir, a huge slab of black rock with an inscription around the edge. The throne that stoodhere was made for Jehangir when he was Prince Salim.
Off to your right from here (as you face the river) is Shish Mahal (Mirror Palace), with walls inlaid with tiny mirrors. At the time of research it had been closed for some time due to restoration, although you could peek through cracks in the doors at the sparkling mirrors inside.
Further along the eastern edge of the fort you’ll find Musamman Burj and
Khas Mahal ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), the wonderful white-marble octagonal tower
and palace where Shah Jahan was imprisoned for eight years until his death in 1666, and from where he could gaze out at the Taj Mahal, the tomb of his wife. When he died, Shah Jahan’s body was taken from here by boat to the Taj. The now closed Mina Masjid, set back slightly from the eastern edge, was his private mosque.
The large courtyard here is Anguri Bagh, a garden that has been brought back to life in recent years. In the courtyard is an innocuous-looking entrance – now locked – that leads down a flight of stairs into a two-storey labyrinth of underground rooms and passageways where Akbar used to keep his 500-strong harem.
Continuing south, the huge red-sandstone Jehangir’s Palace (
GOOGLE MAP
 ) was probably built by Akbar for his son Jehangir. It blends
Indian and Central Asian architectural styles, a reminder of the Mughals’ Afghani cultural roots. In front of the palace is Hauz-i-Jehangir, a huge bowl carved out of a single block of stone, which was used for bathing. Walking past this brings you back to the main path to Amar Singh Gate.
You can walk here from Taj Ganj, or it's ₹40 in a cycle-rickshaw.

HISTORIC BUILDING
( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹10/110, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk)
Nicknamed the Baby Taj, the exquisite tomb of Mizra Ghiyas Beg should not be missed. This Persian nobleman was Mumtaz Mahal’s grandfather and Emperor Jehangir’s wazir (chief minister). His daughter Nur Jahan, who married Jehangir, built the tomb between 1622 and 1628 in a style similar to the tomb she built for Jehangir near Lahore in Pakistan.
It doesn’t have the same awesome beauty as the Taj, but it’s arguably more delicate in appearance thanks to its particularly finely carved jali (marble lattice screens). This was the first Mughal structure built completely from marble, the first to make extensive use of pietra dura and the first tomb to be built on the banks of the Yamuna, which until then had been a sequence of beautiful pleasure gardens.
You can combine a trip here with Chini-ka-Rauza, Mehtab Bagh and Ram Bagh, all on the east bank. A cycle-rickshaw covering all four should cost about ₹300 return from the Taj, including waiting time. An autorickshaw should be ₹450.

This Persian-style riverside tomb of Afzal Khan, a poet who served as Shah Jahan’s chief minister, was built between 1628 and 1639. Rarely visited, it is hidden away down a shady avenue of trees on the east bank of the Yamuna.

This park, originally built by Emperor Babur as the last in a series of 11 parks on the Yamuna’s east bank, long before the Taj was conceived, fell into disrepair until it was little more than a huge mound of sand. To protect the Taj from the erosive effects of the sand blown across the river, the park was reconstructed and is now one the best places from which to view the great mausoleum.The gardens in the Taj are perfectly aligned with the ones here, and the view
of the Taj from the fountain directly in front of the entrance gate is a special one.

TOP TAJ VIEWS
INSIDE THE TAJ GROUNDS
You may have to pay ₹750 for the privilege, but it’s only when you’re inside the grounds themselves that you can really get up close and personal with the world’s most beautiful building. Don’t miss inspecting the marble inlay work (pietra dura) inside the pishtaqs (large arched recesses) on the four outer walls. And don’t forget to bring a small torch with you so that you can shine it on similar pietra dura work inside the dark central chamber of the mausoleum. Note the translucency of both the white marble and the semiprecious stones inlaid into it.
FROM MEHTAB BAGH
Tourists are no longer allowed to wander freely along the riverbank on the opposite side of the Yamuna River, but you can still enjoy a view of the back of the Taj from the 16th- century Mughal park Mehtab Bagh, with the river flowing between you and the mausoleum. A path leading down to the river beside the park offers the same view for free, albeit from a more restricted angle.
LOOKING UP FROM THE SOUTH BANK OF THE RIVER
This is a great place to be for sunset. Take the path that hugs the outside of the Taj’s eastern wall and walk all the way down to the small temple beside the river. You should be able to find boat hands down here willing to row you out onto the water for an even more romantic view. Expect to pay around ₹100 per boat. For safety reasons, it’s best not to wander down here on your own for sunset.
FROM A ROOFTOP CAFE IN TAJ GANJ
Perfect for sunrise shots; there are some wonderful photos to be had from the numerous rooftop cafes in Taj Ganj. We think the cafe on Saniya Palace Hotel is the pick of the bunch, with its plant-filled design and great position, but many of them are good. And all offer the bonus of being able to view the Taj with the added comfort of an early-morning cup of coffeecup of coffee.
FROM AGRA FORT
With a decent zoom lens you can capture some fabulous images of the Taj from Agra Fort, especially if you’re willing to get up at the crack of dawn to see the sun rising up from behind it. The best places to shoot it from are probably Musamman Burj and Khas Mahal, the octagonal tower and palace where Shah Jahan was imprisoned for eight years until his death.
TAJ MAHAL MYTHS
THE TAJ IS A HINDU TEMPLE
The well-publicised theory that the Taj was in fact a Shiva temple built in the 12th century and only later converted into Mumtaz Mahal’s famous mausoleum was developed by Purushottam Nagesh Oak. The Mughals had form in this regard, at Somnath and the Qutb Minar in Delhi among other places, but in 2000 India’s Supreme Court dismissed his petition to have the sealed basement rooms of the Taj opened to prove his theory. Oak also claims that the Kaaba, Stonehenge and the Papacy all have Hindu origins.
THE BLACK TAJ MAHAL
The story goes that Shah Jahan planned to build a negative image of the Taj Mahal in black marble on the opposite side of the river as his own mausoleum, and that work began before he was imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb in Agra Fort. Extensive excavations at Mehtab Bagh have found no trace of any such construction.
CRAFTSMEN MUTILATIONS
Legend has it that on completion of the Taj, Shah Jahan ordered that the hands of the project’s craftsmen be chopped off, to prevent them from ever building anything as beautiful again. Some even say he went so far as to have their eyes gouged out. Thankfully, no historical evidence supports either story.
SINKING TAJ
Some experts believe there is evidence to show that the Taj is slowly tilting towards and sinking into the riverbed due to the changing nature of the soil beside an increasingly dry Yamuna River. The Archaeological Survey of India has dismissed any marginal change in the elevation of the building as statistically insignificant, adding that it has not detected any structural damage at its base in the seven decades since its first scientific study of the Taj was carried out, in 1941.2 Activities Hotels allowing nonguests to use their pools include Yamuna View (₹500), Howard Plaza (₹562), Amar (₹500) – with slide – and Clarks Shiraz (₹1000).
TAJ MUSEUM
Within the Taj complex, on the western side of the gardens, is the small but excellent Taj
Museum ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ; h9am-5pm, closed Fri), housing a number of original
Mughal miniature paintings, including a pair of 17th-century ivory portraits of Emperor Shah Jahan and his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It also has some very well preserved gold and silver coins dating from the same period, plus architectural drawings of the Taj and some nifty celadon plates, said to split into pieces or change colour if the food served on them contains poison.
THE SPA MAHAL
If India's most glorious monument looks particularly glowing on your visit, it could come down to a day at the spa. After years of research, Indian and American scientists have identified the culprit that has caused an ongoing discolouration of the mausoleum – marble-white by birth, but now brownish-yellow due to ageing – and it's the same pollutants responsible for global warming. Dubbed the Atmospheric Brown Cloud, black carbon, light-absorbing brown carbon and dust (the latter no surprise to anyone who has visited Agra) have slowly tarnished the surface of the Taj with years of open-stove cooking with wood and dung, vehicle exhaust, brick-making and trash burning in the vicinity.
In addition to an ongoing project to alleviate the larger issue, the Taj has received a mud-pack facial cleanse for the fourth time in its history. Based on a traditional recipe used by Indian women to restore their own facial radiance, a lime-rich clay mixture is added to pollution-affected areas of the monument overnight and is scrubbed off with nylon brushes the next day. And a massive clean-up to prepare for US President Barack Obama's scheduled visit in 2015 (he skipped the visit due to the death of Saudi Arabian King Abdullah), resulted in two tonnes of trash being removed from the Yamuna River. Voila! The Taj looks brand new.

BEST TIMES TO SEE THE TAJ MAHAL
The Taj is arguably at its most atmospheric at sunrise. This is certainly the most comfortable time to visit, with far fewer crowds. Sunset is another magical viewing time. You can also view the Taj for five nights around full moon. Entry numbers are limited, though, and tickets must be bought a day in advance from the Archaeological Survey ofIndia office (

4 Sleeping The main place for budget accommodation is the bustling area of Taj Ganj, immediately south of the Taj, while there’s a high concentration of midrange hotels further south, along Fatehabad Rd. Sadar Bazaar, an area boasting good-quality restaurants, offers another option. Be forewarned: free wi-fi hasn't really caught on in Agra's nicer hotels; expect to pay upwards of ₹500 for 12 hours.Taj Ganj1 Top Sights 1Taj MahalB1

If you aren't set on sleeping under the nose of the Taj, this centrally located travellers' hub offers better value than most Agra spots and has been under the watchful eye of the same family since 1965 (though you can't tell it is pushing 50 years).If you can forgo air-con, the newly renovated cheapies are great value – and things only get better from there. All rooms come with free wi-fi, TV, hot water and large windows, and are set around a peaceful plant-filled, palm-shaded courtyard (a real highlight) and a North Indian pure veg restaurant. The bend- over-backwards owners speak English and French. They couldn't be more helpful, right down to occasionally carting you off somewhere in their hotel rickshaw. Phone ahead for a free pick-up; otherwise, it’s ₹40 in a cycle- rickshaw from the train station. Damn fine masala chai, too.

Agra’s original five-star hotel, opened in 1961, has done well to keep up with the hotel Joneses. The standard doubles are nothing special for this price range, but marble-floored deluxe versions are a pleasant step up and all bathrooms are retiled and spotless.
There are three very good restaurants, two bars (three in season), a gym, a shaded garden and pool area (one of Agra's best) and ayurvedic massages. Some rooms have distant Taj views.

A veteran Marriott manager runs a tight ship in this good-value spot in a quiet part of Sadar Bazaar, where spacious rooms with gleaming bathrooms and marble art tables are worth shelling out a few extra rupees for. There's hardly a need to upgrade to deluxe – they're not noticeably better than standard rooms.
There's a great garden pool, a sleek cocktail bar, a plush Chinese restaurant (with a real Chinese chef – good for an Indian food sabbatical) and free wi-fi (lobby only).
5 Eating Dalmoth is Agra’s famous version of namkin(spicy nibbles). Peitha is a square sweet made from pumpkin and glucose that is flavoured with rosewater, coconut or saffron. You can buy it all over Agra. From October to March look out for gajak, a slightly spicy sesame-seed biscuit strip.

Comfortable booth seating and wood-lattice screens make for intimate dining.6 Drinking & Nightlife A night out in Agra tends to revolve around sitting at a rooftop restaurant with a couple of bottles of beer. None of the restaurants in Taj Ganj are licensed, but they can find alcohol for you if you ask nicely, and don’t mind if you bring your own drinks, as long as you’re discreet. You can catch live Indian classical music and ghazals (Urdu love songs) at restaurants in several of Agra’s top-end hotels, most of which also have bars, albeit of the rather soulless variety.

Sadar Bazaar, the old town and the area around the Taj are full of emporiums. Taj Mahal models are all made of alabaster rather than marble. Very cheap ones are made of soapstone, which scratches easily.
Other popular buys include rugs, leather and gemstones, though the latter are imported from Rajasthan and are cheaper in Jaipur.

STAYING AHEAD OF THE SCAMS
As well as the usual commission rackets and ever-present gem-import scam, some specific methods to relieve Agra tourists of their hard-earned cash include the following.
Rickshaws
When taking an auto-or cycle-rickshaw to the Taj, make sure you are clear which gate you want to go to when negotiating the price. Otherwise, almost without fail, riders will take you to the roundabout at the south end of Shahjahan Gardens Rd – where expensive tongas (horse-drawn carriages) or camels wait to take tour groups to the west gate – and claim that’s where they thought you meant. Only nonpolluting autos can go within a 500m radius of the Taj because of pollution rules, but they can get a lot closer than this.
Fake Marble
Lots of ‘marble’ souvenirs are actually alabaster, or even just soapstone. So you may be paying marble prices for lower quality stones. The mini Taj Mahals are always alabaster because they are too intricate to carve quickly in marble.
8 Information Agra is more wired than most, even in restaurants. Taj Ganj is riddled with internet cafes, most charging from ₹40 per hour.

AIR
Commercial flights to Agra’s Kheria Airport began again in late 2012 after a long absence. Air India (www.airindia.com) now flies to Varanasi (2.05pm, from ₹4000) via Khajuraho (from ₹3000) Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, and to Mumbai (12.30pm, from ₹1500) via Gwailor (from ₹3200) on Monday and Wednesday. At time of writing there was no return flight via Khajuraho.
To access the airport, part of Indian Air Force territory, your name must be on the list of those with booked flights that day. Tickets must be purchased online or by phone.

To get to the ISBT, take the air-con public bus from Agra Cantt train station to Dayalbagh (₹22) but get off at Baghwan Talkies (₹16), from where shared autos (₹8) can take you to the ISBT; or catch an autorickshaw from Taj Ganz (₹150).TRAIN
Most trains leave from Agra Cantonment (Cantt) train station (
GOOGLE MAP
 ), although some go from Agra Fort station. A few trains, such as
Kota PNBE Express, run as slightly different numbers on different days than those listed, but timings remain the same. If you are heading to Jaipur on Thursday, the best option is the 12403/12404 ALD JP Express, departing Agra at 7.15am.
Express trains are well set up for day trippers to/from Delhi but trains run to Delhi all day. If you can’t reserve a seat, just buy a ‘general ticket’ for the next train (about ₹90), find a seat in sleeper class then upgrade when the ticket collector comes along. Most of the time, he won’t even make you pay any more. A new semi-express train between Delhi and Agra, the Gatimaan Express, should be up and running by the time you read this. It travels 160km per hour (India's fastest) and a full 30km per hour faster than the Shatabdi Express.
For Orchha, catch one of the many daily trains to Jhansi (sleeper from ₹110, three hours), then take a shared auto to the bus stand (₹10) from where shared autos run all day to Orchha (₹20). An autorickshaw costs ₹200 for the same route.8 Getting Around
AUTORICKSHAW
Agra’s green-and-yellow autorickshaws run on CNG (compressed natural gas) and are less environmentally destructive. Just outside Agra Cantt station is the prepaid autorickshaw booth, which gives you a good guide for haggling elsewhere. Usually, trips under three kilometres should not cost more than ₹50. Note, autos aren’t allowed to go to Fatehpur Sikri.
Sample prices from Agra Cantt station: Fatehabad Rd ₹150; ISBT bus stand ₹200; Sadar Bazaar ₹70; Sikandra ₹200; Taj Mahal ₹100 (Taj West Gate) and ₹130 (Taj South Gate), Shilpgram (Taj East Gate) ₹150; half-day (four-hour) tour ₹400; full-day (eight-hour) tour ₹600. If you just want to shoot to the Taj and back with waiting time, they will charge ₹250. Prices listed here do not include the ₹5 booking fee, which is extra.
CYCLE-RICKSHAW
Prices from the Taj Mahal's South Gate include: Agra Cantt train station ₹80;Agra Fort ₹40; Bijili Ghar bus stand ₹50; Fatehabad Rd ₹30; Kinari Bazaar ₹100; Sadar Bazaar ₹50; half-day tour ₹400. Tack on another ₹10 to ₹20 if two people are riding.
TAXI
Outside Agra Cantt the prepaid taxi booth gives a good idea of what taxis should cost. Non-AC prices include: Delhi ₹3500; Fatehabad Rd ₹200; Sadar Bazaar ₹100; Taj Mahal ₹200; half-day (four-hour) tour ₹750; full-day (eight-hour) tour ₹1000. Prices here do not include the ₹10 booking fee and tolls or parking charges (if applicable).
Around Agra
Fatehpur Sikri
%05613 / Pop 29,000
This magnificent fortified ancient city, 40km west of Agra, was the short-lived capital of the Mughal empire between 1571 and 1585, during the reign of Emperor Akbar. Akbar visited the village of Sikri to consult the Sufi saint Shaikh Salim Chishti, who predicted the birth of an heir to the Mughal throne. When the prophecy came true, Akbar built his new capital here, including a stunning mosque – still in use today – and three palaces for each of his favourite wives, one a Hindu, one a Muslim and one a Christian (though Hindu villagers in Sikri dispute these claims). The city was an Indo-Islamic masterpiece, but erected in an area that supposedly suffered from water shortages and so was abandoned shortly after Akbar’s death.
It’s easy to visit this World Heritage Site as a day trip from Agra, but there are a couple of decent places to stay, and the colourful bazaar in the village of Fatehpur, just below the ruins, as well as the small village of Sikri, a few kilometres north, are worth exploring. The red-sandstone palace walls are at their most atmospheric and photogenic at sunset.
The bus stand is at the eastern end of the bazaar. Walking another 1km northeast will bring you to Agra Gate and the junction with the main Agra– Jaipur road, from where you can catch buses.p,

1 Sights The palace buildings lie beside the Jama Masjid. Both sit on top of a ridge that runs between the small villages of Fatehpur and Sikri.
Jama Masjid
( 
MOSQUE
GOOGLE MAP
 Click here)
This beautiful, immense mosque was completed in 1571 and contains elements of Persian and Indian design. The main entrance, at the top of a flight of stone steps, is through the spectacular 54m-high Buland Darwaza (Victory Gate), built to commemorate Akbar’s military victory in Gujarat.
Inside the courtyard of the mosque is the stunning white-marble tomb of Sufisaint Shaikh Salim Chishti, which was completed in 1581 and is entered through an original door made of ebony. Inside it are brightly coloured flower murals, while the sandalwood canopy is decorated with mother-of-pearl shell. Just as Akbar came to the saint four centuries ago hoping for a son, childless women visit his tomb today and tie a thread to the jali (carved lattice screens), which are among the finest in India. To the right of the tomb lie the gravestones of family members of Shaikh Salim Chishti and nearby is the entrance to an underground tunnel (barred by a locked gate) that reputedly goes all the way to Agra Fort. Behind the entrance to the tunnel, on the far wall, are three holes, part of the ancient ventilation system. You can still feel the rush of cool air forcing its way through them. Just east of Shaikh Salim Chishti’s tomb is the red-sandstone tomb of Islam Khan, the final resting place of Shaikh Salim Chishti’s grandson and one-time governor of Bengal.
On the east wall of the courtyard is a smaller entrance to the mosque – the Shahi Darwaza (King’s Gate), which leads to the palace complex.
Palaces & Pavilions
(Indian/foreigner ₹20/260, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk)
PALACES
The main sight at Fatehpur Sikri is the stunning imperial complex of pavilions and palaces spread among a large abandoned 'city' peppered with Mughal masterpieces: courtyards, intricate carvings, servants quarters, vast gateways and ornamental pools.
A large courtyard dominates the northeast entrance at Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audiences). Now a pristinely manicured garden, this is where Akbar presided over the courts from the middle seat of the five equal seatings along the western wall, flanked by his advisors. It was built to utilise an echo sound system, so Akbar could hear anything at any time from anywhere in the open space. Justice was dealt with swiftly if legends are to be believed, with public executions said to have been carried out here by elephants trampling to death convicted criminals.
The Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audiences), found at the northern end of the Pachisi Courtyard, looks nothing special from the outside, but the interior is dominated by a magnificently carved stone central column. This pillar flares tocreate a flat-topped plinth linked to the four corners of the room by narrow stone bridges. From this plinth Akbar is believed to have debated with scholars and ministers who stood at the ends of the four bridges.
Next to Diwan-i-Khas is the Treasury, which houses secret stone safes in some corners (one has been left with its stone lid open for visitors to see). Sea monsters carved on the ceiling struts were there to protect the fabulous wealth once stored here. The so-called Astrologer’s Kiosk in front has roof supports carved in a serpentine Jain style.
Just south of the Astrologer's Kiosk is Pachisi Courtyard, named after the ancient game known in India today as ludo. The large, plus-shaped game board is visible surrounding the block in the middle of the courtyard. In the southeast corner is the most intricately carved structure in the whole complex, the tiny but elegant Rumi Sultana, which was said to be the palace built for Akbar’s Turkish Muslim wife. Other theories say it was used by Akbar himself as a palace powder room or R&R room during court sessions. On one corner of the Ladies Garden just west of Pachisi is the impressive Panch Mahal, a pavilion whose five storeys decrease in size until the top consists of only a tiny kiosk. The lower floor has 84 different columns; in total there are 176 columns.
Continuing anticlockwise will bring you to the Ornamental Pool. Here, singers and musicians would perform on the platform above the water while Akbar watched from the pavilion in his private quarters, known as Daulat Khana (Abode of Fortune). Behind the pavilion is the Khwabgah (Dream House), a sleeping area with a huge stone bunk bed. Nowadays the only ones sleeping here are bats, hanging from the ceiling. The small room in the far corner is full of them.
Heading west from the Ornamental Pool beholds the Palace of Jodh Bai, and the one-time home of Akbar’s Hindu wife, said to be his favourite. Set around an enormous courtyard, it blends traditional Indian columns, Islamic cupolas and turquoise-blue Persian roof tiles. Just outside, to the left of Jodh Bai’s former kitchen, is the Palace of the Christian Wife. This was used by Akbar’s Goan wife Mariam, who gave birth to Jehangir here in 1569. Some believe Akbar never had a Christian wife and that Mariam was short for Mariam-Ut-Zamani, a title he gave to Jodh Bai meaning 'Beautiful like a Rose', or 'Most Beautiful Woman on Earth'. Like many of the buildings in the palace complex, it containselements of different religions, as befitted Akbar’s tolerant religious beliefs. The domed ceiling is Islamic in style, while remnants of a wall painting of the Hindu god Shiva can also be found.
Walking past the Palace of the Christian Wife once more will take you west to Birbal Bhavan, ornately carved inside and out, and thought to have been the living quarters of one of Akbar’s most senior ministers. The Lower Haramsara, just to the south, housed Akbar's large inventory of live-in female servants.
Plenty of ruins are scattered behind the whole complex, including the Caravanserai, a vast courtyard surrounded by rooms where visiting merchants stayed. Badly defaced carvings of elephants still guard Hathi Pol (Elephant Gate), while the remains of the small Stonecutters’ Mosque and a hammam (bath) are also a short stroll away. Other unnamed ruins can be explored north of what is known as the Mint but is thought to have in fact been stables, including some in the interesting village of Sikri to the north.

DANGERS & ANNOYANCES
Take no notice of anyone who gets on the Fatehpur Sikri–Agra bus before the final stop at Idgah Bus Stand, telling you that you have arrived at the city centre or the Taj Mahal. You haven’t. You’re still a long autorickshaw ride away, and the man trying to tease you off the bus is, surprise surprise, an autorickshaw driver.8 Getting There & Around Tours and taxis all arrive at the Gulistan Tourist Complex parking lot, from which shuttle buses (₹10) depart for Fatehpur Sikri's Diwan-i-Am entrance (right side of the street) and Jodh Bai entrance (left side of the street). Note that if you have hired an unauthorised guide, you will not be allowed to enter at Diwan-i-Am.
Buses run to Agra’s Idgah Bus Stand every half-hour (₹40) from 5.30am to 6.30pm. If you miss those, walk out through Agra Gate and another 350m to Bypass Crossing Stop on the main road and wave down a Jaipur–Agra bus. They run every 30 minutes or so, day and night.
For Bharatpur (₹25, 40 minutes) or Jaipur (₹190, 4½ hours), wave down a westbound bus from Bypass Crossing Stop.
Regular trains for Agra Fort Station leave Fatehpur Sikri at 4.49am (59811 Haldighati Pass) and 8.16pm (19037 Avadh Express), but there are simpler passenger trains at 10.17am and 3.55pm as well as four other trains that fly through at various times. Just buy a ‘general’ ticket at the station and pile in (₹20, one to two hours).Uttar Pradesh

Why Go?
The enormous state of Uttar Pradesh is one of India's mystical cradles and, as aresult, is justifiably one of India's roads most taken. Its unmistakable spirituality and religious fervour leaves long-lasting impressions: being wow-ed along atmospheric riverside ghats such as Manikarnika and Dashashwamedh in India’s holiest city, Varanasi; the contemplative aura that emanates from ancient Buddhist stupas in Kushinagar and Sarnath; the serenity of waking up before dawn to watch locals perform puja (offerings or prayers) in sacred Chitrakut; or the intense power of piety in Allahabad, where throngs of feverish devotees bow to the chaotic confluence of two of India's holiest rivers, the Ganges and Yamuna.
Along the way, a groundswell of Mughal and Nawab architectural and gastronomic highpoints – notably in Lucknow, Allahabad and of course Agra – ensure all-sensory satisfaction in India’s imperial heartland.

History Over 2000 years ago this region was part of Ashoka’s great Buddhist empire, remnants of which can be found in the ruins at the pilgrimage centre of Sarnath near Varanasi. Muslim raids from the northwest began in the 11th century, and by the 16th century the region was part of the Mughal empire, with its capital in Agra, then Delhi and, for a brief time, Fatehpur Sikri.
Following the decline of the Mughal empire, Persians stepped in briefly before the Nawabs of Avadh rose to prominence in the central part of the region, notably around the current capital of Lucknow. The Nawabs were responsible for turning Lucknow into a flourishing centre for the arts, culture and culinary delights, which continues to this day. But their empire came to a dramatic end when the British East India Company deposed the last nawab, triggering the First War of Independence (Indian Uprising) of 1857. During the 147-day Siege of Lucknow, British Chief Commissioner Sir Henry Lawrence was killed defending the British Residency, which remains in remarkable preservation in Lucknow.
Agra was later merged with Avadh and the state became known as United Province. It was renamed Uttar Pradesh (UP) after Independence and has since been the most dominant state in Indian politics, producing half of the country’s prime ministers, most of them from Allahabad. The local population doesn’t seem to have benefited much from this, though, as poor governance, a high birth rate, a low literacy rate and an erratic electricity supply have held back economic progress in UP in the past 60 years.
In 2000, the mountainous northwestern part of the state was carved off to create the new state of Uttaranchal.

%0522 / Pop 2.9 million
Liberally sprinkled with British Raj–era buildings – including the famous Residency – and boasting two superb mausoleums, the capital of Uttar Pradesh plays a somewhat unwarranted third fiddle to Agra and Varanasi, but caters well to history buffs, without attracting the hordes of tourists that sometimes make sightseeing tiresome. By contrast, Lucknow's modern side boasts a unique Iron Curtain-esque feel, with grandiose monuments and overstated parks and gardens, many boasting marble sidewalks and pink sandstone a plenty (we imagine they were going for a Washington, DC aesthetic but ended up more Pyongyang). It's nothing if not interesting.
The city rose to prominence as the home of the Nawabs of Avadh (Oudh) who were great patrons of the culinary and other arts, particularly dance and music. Lucknow’s reputation as a city of culture, gracious living and rich cuisine has continued to this day (it conveniently rhymes in Hindi: 'Nawab, Aadaab [Respect], Kebab and Shabab [Beauty]').Lucknow

The large collection of gardens and ruins that makes up the Residency offers aThe large collection of gardens and ruins that makes up the Residency offers a fascinating historical glimpse of the beginning of the end for the British Raj. Built in 1800, the Residency became the stage for the most dramatic events of the 1857 First War of Independence (Indian Uprising), the Siege of Lucknow, a 147-day siege that claimed the lives of thousands.
The compound has been left as it was at the time of the final relief and the walls are still pockmarked from bullets and cannon balls.
The focus is the well-designed museum (open 8am to 4.30pm) in the main Residency building, which includes a scale model of the original buildings. Downstairs are the huge basement rooms where many of the British women and children lived throughout the siege.
The cemetery around the ruined St Mary’s church is where 2000 of the defenders were buried, including their leader, Sir Henry Lawrence, ‘who tried to do his duty’ according to the famous inscription on his weathered gravestone.

ISLAMIC TOMB

 ; Hussainabad Trust Rd; Indian/foreigner ₹50/500; h6am-6:30pm)
This colossal imambara (tomb dedicated to a Shiite holy man) is worth seeing in its own right, but the highly unusual labyrinth of corridors inside its upper floors make a visit here particularly special. The ticket price includes entrance to Chota Imambara, the clock tower and the baradari (summer palace), all walking distance from here.
The complex is accessed through two enormous gateways which lead into a huge courtyard. On one side is an attractive mosque, on the other a large baori (step-well) which can be explored. Bring a torch (flashlight). At the far end of the courtyard is the huge central hall, one of the world’s largest vaulted galleries. Tazias (small replicas of Imam Hussain’s tomb in Karbala, Iraq) are stored inside and are paraded around during the Shiite mourning ceremony of Muharram.
But it’s what is beyond the small entrance – intriguingly marked ‘labyrinth’ – to the left of the central hall, that steals the show. It leads to the Bhulbhulaiya, an enticing network of narrow passageways that winds its way inside the upper floors of the tomb’s structure, eventually leading out to rooftop balconies. Aswith the step-well, it’s handy to have a torch.
Just beyond the Bara Imambara is the unusual but imposing gateway Rumi

Lucknow's excellent Mughlai kitchens are famous for a wide range of mouth-watering kebabs and their biryani dishes as well. It’s also known for dum pukht – the ‘art’ of steam-pressure cooking, in which meat and vegetables are cooked in a sealed clay pot.

LUCKNOW’S KEBABS DECONSTRUCTED
KAKORI KEBAB
Originates from Kakori, a small town outside Lucknow. Legend has it that the old and toothless Nawab of Kakori asked his royal bawarchi (chef) to make kebabs that would simply melt in the mouth. So these kebabs are made adding papaya as a tenderiser to raw mincemeat and a mix of spices. They are then applied to skewers and barbecued over charcoals.
GALAWAT KEBAB
This is the mouth-watering creation that is served up in Lucknow’s most famous kebab restaurant, Tunday Kababi. There it is simply referred to as a mutton kebab, and in other restaurants it is often called Tunday. Galawat is the name of the tenderiser that’s used for these kebabs. Essentially, they are the same as Kakori kebabs except that rather than being barbecued they are made into patties and shallow fried in oil or ghee.SHAMI KEBAB
Raw mincemeat is boiled with spices and black gram lentil. It is then ground on stone before being mixed with finely chopped onions, coriander leaves and green chillies, and shaped into patties and then shallow fried.

TOP STATE FESTIVALS
Magh Mela (Jan/Feb, Allahabad) A huge annual religious fair that transforms into the world's largest human gathering, the Purna Kumbh Mela, every 12th year (next in 2025). Holi (Feb/Mar, Mathura and Vrindavan) This national festival is celebrated with particular fervour around Mathura and Vrindavan, spiritual home of Krishna. Purnima (Sarnath; hApr/May) (Apr/May, Sarnath) Also known as Vesak, Buddha Jayanti or, informally, Buddha's birthday, Purnima actually celebrates the birth, enlightenment and death of Buddha. Sarnath, just outside Varanasi, takes on a particularly festive air on this day, when Buddhists from many countries take part in a procession and a fair is held. Janmastami (Aug/Sep, Mathura) You can barely move here during Krishna's birthday, when temples are swathed in decorations and musical dramas about Krishna are performed.
Ram Lila (Sep/Oct, Varanasi) Every year since the early 1800s the Ram Lila, a lengthy version of the Ramayana, has been performed beside Ramnagar Fort in Varanasi. The epic saga of Rama's marriage to Sita and his battle against the demon king Ravana is performed mainly by Brahmin youths aided by masks, music, dancing and giant papier- mâché figures.

AYODHYA & AROUND
%05278 / Pop 58,000
With monkeys galore, the usual smattering of cows and even the odd working elephant, the relatively traffic-free streets of Ayodhya would be an intriguing place to spend some time even if it wasn’t for the religious significance of the place. This is not only the birthplace of Rama, and as such one of Hinduism’s seven holy cities, nor just the birthplace of four of Jainism’s 24 tirthankars (religious teachers), this is also the site of one of modern India’s most controversial religious disputes.
Ayodhya became tragically synonymous with Hindu extremism in 1992, when rioting Hindus tore down the Babri Masjid, a mosque built by the Mughals in the 15th century, which Hindus claimed stood on the site of an earlier Rama temple, marking Lord Rama’s birthplace. Hindus built Ram Janam Bhumi in its place. Tit-for-tat reprisals soon followed, including reactionary riots across the country that led to more than 2000 deaths, and the problem eventually reached the High Court. Archaeological investigations were carried out at the site and, in September 2010, the Allahabad High Court ruled that the site should be split equally between three religious groups; two Hindu, one Muslim. The Muslim group, Sunni Waqf Board, appealed parts of the ruling but the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of the Allahabad ruling in 2011. Since the verdict, things have remained relatively calm. Meanwhile, security around the Ram Janam Bhumi remains incredibly tight.
The slightly larger town of Faizabad, 7km away, is the jumping-off point for Ayodhya and where you’ll find more accommodation. From the Faizabad busstand, turn left onto the main road where you’ll find shared rickshaws (₹10 to ₹20, 20 minutes) to Ayodhya, where you can make a walking tour of the temples.

Ram Janam Bhumi

HINDU TEMPLE
If you turn left at Dashrath Bhavan, when coming from Hanumanghari, you soon reach the highly contentious temple that marks the birthplace of Rama. Security here is staggering (think crossing from West Bank into Israel). You must first show your passport, then leave all belongings apart from your passport and money (even your belt) in nearby lockers.
You are then searched several times before being accompanied through a caged corridor that leads to a spot 20m away from a makeshift tent of a shrine, which marks Rama’s birthplacewhich marks Rama’s birthplace.

ALLAHABAD
%0532 / Pop 1.2 million
For all its importance in Hindu mythology, Indian history and modern politics, Allahabad is a surprisingly relaxed city that offers plenty in terms of sights, but little in the way of in-yer-face hassle.
Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, is believed to have landed on earth in Allahabad, or Prayag as it was originally known, and to have called it the king of all pilgrimage centres. Indeed, Sangam, a river confluence on the outskirts of the city, is the most celebrated of India’s four Kumbh Mela locations. The vast riverbanks here attract tens of millions of pilgrims every six years for either the Kumbh Mela or the Ardh (Half) Mela, but every year there is a smaller Magh Mela.
Of more immediate interest to casual visitors are Allahabad’s grand Raj-era buildings, its Mughal fort and tombs, and the historic legacy of the Nehru family.Allahabad

 )
This is the particularly auspicious point where two of India’s holiest rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna, meet one of Hinduism’s mythical rivers, the Saraswati. All year round, pilgrims row boats out to this holy spot, but their numbers increase dramatically during the annual Magh Mela (Allahabad; hJan/Feb), a six- week festival held between January and March, which culminates in six communal ‘holy dips’.
Every 12 years the massive Kumbh Mela takes place here, attracting millions of people, while the Ardh Mela (Half Mela) is held here every six years.
In the early 1950s, 350 pilgrims were killed in a stampede to the soul- cleansing water (an incident re-created vividly in Vikram Seth’s immense novel A Suitable Boy). The last Ardh Mela, in 2007, attracted more than 70 million people – considered to be the largest-ever human gathering until the 2013 Kumbh Mela, which attracted a guestimated 32 million on Mauni Amavasya, the main bathing day, and 100 million across the 55-day festival; expect equally astonishing numbers at the next Allahabad Kumbh Mela in 2025.
Old boat hands will row you out to the sacred confluence for around ₹50 per person (hard-bargaining Indian) or ₹100 (hard-bargaining foreigner), or ₹600 to ₹800 per boat.
Around the corner from Sangam (skirt the riverbank around the front ofAkbar’s Fort) are the Saraswat (

A second tomb belongs to Shah Begum (

mother (Jehangir’s first wife), who committed suicide in 1603 with an opium overdose because of the ongoing feud between her son and his father. Between these two, a third, particularly attractive tomb was constructed by Nesa Begum

Built by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, this 16th-century fort on the northern bank of the Yamuna has massive walls with three gateways flanked by towers. Most of it is occupied by the Indian army and cannot be visited, but a small door in the eastern wall by Sangam leads to one part you can enter, the underground Patalpuri Temple.
This unique temple is crowded with all sorts of idols – pick up some coins from the change dealers outside so you can leave small offerings as you go. You may be pressured into giving ₹10 to ₹100 at some shrines. A few coins are perfectly acceptable.
Outside the temple – though its roots can be seen beneath ground – is the

Known as a mini Varanasi because of its many temples and ghats, this small, peaceful town on the banks of the River Mandakini is the stuff of Hindu legends. It is here that Hinduism’s principal trinity – Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva – took on their incarnations. It is also the place where Lord Rama is believed to have spent 11½ years of his 14-year exile after being banished from his birthplace in Ayodhya at the behest of a jealous stepmother.
Today Chitrakut attracts throngs of pilgrims, giving the area a strong religious quality, particularly by Ram Ghat, the town’s centre of activity, and at the holy hill of Kamadgiri, 2km away.
Dozens, sometimes hundreds, of devotees descend onto Ram Ghat to take holy dips at dawn before returning at the end of the day for the evening aarti (an auspicious lighting of lamps/candles). Colourful rowboats (with rabbits) wait here to take you across to theopposite bank, which is actually in Madhya Pradesh, or to scenic spots along the river. The 2km-trip to the Glass Temple, a building covered in religious mosaics made with thousands of pieces of coloured glass, is popular. During the day, many people make their way to Kamadgiri, a hill revered as the holy embodiment of Lord Rama. A 5km- circuit (90 minutes) around the base of the hill takes you past prostrating pilgrims, innumerable monkeys and temples galore.

Brace yourself. You're about to enter one of the most blindingly colourful, unrelentingly chaotic and unapologetically indiscreet places on earth. Varanasi takes no prisoners. But if you're ready for it, this may just turn out to be your favourite stop of all.
Also known at various times in history as Kashi (City of Life) and Benares, this is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities and is regarded as one of Hinduism's seven holy cities. Pilgrims come to the ghats lining the River Ganges here to wash away a lifetime of sins in the sacred waters or to cremate their loved ones. It's a particularly auspicious place to die, since expiring here offers moksha (liberation from the cycle of birth and death), making Varanasi the beating heart of the Hindu universe. Most visitors agree it's a magical place, but it's not for the faint-hearted. Here the most intimate rituals of life and death take place in public, and the sights, sounds and smells in and around the ghats – not to mention the almost constant attention from touts – can be overwhelming. Persevere. Varanasi is unique, and a walk along the ghats or a boat ride on the river will live long in the memory.
The old city of Varanasi is situated along the western bank of the Ganges and extends back from the riverbank ghats in a labyrinth of alleys called galis that are too narrow for traffic. They can be disorienting, but the popular hotels and restaurants are usually signposted and, however lost you become, you will eventually end up at a ghat and get your bearings. You can walk all the way along the ghats, apart from during and immediately after the monsoon, when the river level is too high.
India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi, is a Varanasi Member of Parliament (MP), so it has been getting some extra attention of late, with new(     ),
gg
,
projects, roadworks and a general – and much-needed – sprucing up.
History Thought to date back to around 1200 BC, Varanasi really rose to prominence in the 8th century AD, when Shankaracharya, a reformer of Hinduism, established Shiva worship as the principal sect. The Afghans destroyed Varanasi around AD 1300, after laying waste to nearby Sarnath, but the fanatical Mughal emperor Aurangzeb was the most destructive, looting and destroying almost all of the temples. The old city of Varanasi may look antique, but few buildings are more than a couple of hundred years old.Varanasi

HINDU TEMPLE
(Golden Temple;

GOOGLE MAP
 ; h3am-11am, 12.30-8pm & 9-11pm)
There are temples at almost every turn in Varanasi, but this is the most famous of the lot. It is dedicated to Vishveswara – Shiva as lord of the universe. The current temple was built in 1776 by Ahalya Bai of Indore; the 800kg of gold plating on the tower and dome was supplied by Maharaja Ranjit Singh of Lahore 50 years later.
The area is full of soldiers because of security issues and communal tensions. Bags, cameras, mobile phones, pens or any other electronic device must be deposited in lockers (₹20) before you enter the alleyway it’s in. Accounts vary as to whether or not foreigners can go in the temple itself. Officially, non- Hindus, which counts most foreigners, cannot enter the temple, but many expats living in Varanasi as well as travelers have reported they were allowed in. We get the impression it's up to the whim of the security guards that day. For what's it's worth, they would not let us in until we returned with a local handler to sort things out. Declaring an interest or curiosity in Hindu beliefs may help you gain access (and it helps if you have an offering in hand, which can be purchased inside or outside the temple). Either way, bring your original passport (not a copy) if you want to enter. Once inside, it's quite a show, with people pushing, tripping over and sometimes violently asserting themselves for a chance to give an offering and touch the lingam, which resolves one of all sins. Hindus routinely wait in lines for 48 hours to enter on particularly holy days.
On the northern side of Vishwanath Temple is the Gyan Kupor Well (Well of
Knowledge;

 ). The faithful believe drinking its water leads to a
higher spiritual plane, though they are prevented from doing so by a strong security screen. Non-Hindus are also not allowed to enter here, and here the ruleis enforced more strictly.

 ; museum Indian/foreigner ₹20/150; h10-5.30pm)
This crumbling 17th-century fort and palace, on the eastern bank of the Ganges, isn't worth coming out to if you only have a few days in Varanasi, but it is a beautiful place to watch the sun set over the river. It also houses an eccentric museum. There are vintage American cars, jewel-encrusted sedan chairs, a superb weaponry section and an extremely unusual astrological clock.
The current maharaja, Anant Narayan Singh – still known in these parts as the Maharaja of Benares despite such royal titles being officially abolished in 1971 – continues his family tradition of attending the annual month-long Ram Lila drama festival (Varanasi; hSep/Oct) held in the streets behind the fort.
Boats operate a shuttle service across the river (₹20 return, 10 minutes) between 5am and 8pm, but from October to mid-June, you can also cross on a somewhat steady pontoon bridge or take the long way round on a rickshaw (₹200). A new bridge, under construction now for years, means most folks will just drive across – if it's ever finished. A boat all the way back to Dashashwamedh Ghat is ₹200.
Ghats
Spiritually enlightening and fantastically photogenic, Varanasi is at its brilliant best by the ghats, the long stretch of steps leading down to the water on thebest by the ghats, the long stretch of steps leading down to the water on the western bank of the Ganges. Most are used for bathing but there are also several ‘burning ghats’ where bodies are cremated in public. The main one is Manikarnika: you’ll often see funeral processions threading their way through the backstreets to this ghat.
The best time to visit the ghats is at dawn when the river is bathed in a mellow light as pilgrims come to perform puja to the rising sun, and at sunset when the main ganga aarti (river worship ceremony) takes place at Dashashwamedh Ghat.
About 80 ghats border the river, but the main group extends from Assi Ghat, near the university, northwards to Raj Ghat, near the road and rail bridge.
A boat trip along the river provides the perfect introduction, although for most of the year the water level is low enough for you to walk freely along the whole length of the ghats. It’s a world-class ‘people-watching’ stroll as you mingle with the fascinating mixture of people who come to the Ganges not only for a ritual bath but also to wash clothes, do yoga, offer blessings, sell flowers, get a massage, play cricket, wash their buffaloes, improve their karma by giving to beggars or simply hang around.

Assi Ghat, the furthest south of the main ghats and one of the biggest, is particularly important as the River Assi meets the Ganges near here and pilgrims come to worship a Shiva lingam (phallic image of Shiva) beneath a peepul tree. Evenings are particularly lively, as the ghat’s vast concreted area fills up with hawkers and entertainers. It’s a popular starting point for boat trips and there are some excellent hotels here.

 )
Varanasi’s liveliest and most colourful ghat is Dashashwamedh Ghat, easily reached at the end of the main road from Godaulia Crossing. The name indicates that Brahma sacrificed (medh) 10 (das) horses (aswa) here. In spite of the oppressive boat owners, flower sellers and touts trying to drag you off to a silk shop, it’s a wonderful place to linger and people-watch while soaking up the atmosphere.
Every evening at 7pm an elaborate ganga aarti ceremony with puja, fire and dance is staged here.

SACRED SITE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
Manikarnika Ghat, the main burning ghat, is the most auspicious place for a Hindu to be cremated. Dead bodies are handled by outcasts known as doms, and are carried through the alleyways of the old city to the holy Ganges on a bamboo stretcher swathed in cloth. The corpse is doused in the Ganges prior to cremation.
Huge piles of firewood are stacked along the top of the ghat; every log is carefully weighed on giant scales so that the price of cremation can be calculated. Each type of wood has its own price, sandalwood being the most expensive. There is an art to using just enough wood to completely incinerate a corpse. You can watch cremations but always show reverence by behaving respectfully. Photography is strictly prohibited. You’re almost guaranteed to be led by a priest, or more likely a guide, to the upper floor of a nearby building from where you can watch cremations taking place, and then asked for a donation (in dollars) towards the cost of wood. If you don’t want to make a donation, don’t follow them.
Above the steps here is a tank known as the Manikarnika Well. Parvati is said to have dropped her earring here and Shiva dug the tank to recover it, filling the depression with his sweat. The Charanpaduka, a slab of stone between the well and the ghat, bears footprints made by Vishnu. Privileged VIPs are cremated at the Charanpaduka, which also has a temple dedicated to Ganesh.

o River Trips
BOATING
 
A dawn rowing boat ride along the Ganges is a quintessential Varanasi experience. The early-morning light is particularly inspiring, and all the colour and clamour of pilgrims bathing and performing puja unfolds before you. An hour-long trip south from Dashashwamedh Ghat to Harishchandra Ghat and back is popular, but be prepared to see a burning corpse at Harishchandra.
Early evening is also a good time to be on the river, when you can light a lotus flower candle (₹10) and set it adrift on the water before watching the nightly ganga aarti ceremony (7pm) at Dashashwamedh Ghat directly from the boat.
The official government price of boats is ₹250 per hour for two to four people, but it is not enforced. Count yourself lucky if you manage ₹300 per person per hour and be prepared for some hard bargaining. And be warned: it's best to arrange a boat the day before. If you show up as the sun is about to rise, you'll find yourself in a Varanasi Standoff: a battle of wills between yourself, a boatsman and the unforgiving rising sun – to the tune of ₹1000 per person.
Many guesthouses offer boat trips, although they’re more expensive than dealing with the boatmen directly. Brown Bread Bakery can arrange a hassle- free ride in their own boats for less than riverside (₹150 per hour for one person, ₹50 per hour per additional person) with some à la carte coffee and cakes to boot.

Varanasi is full of Ayurvedic imposters. Serious seekers should come here, the city's real deal Ayurvedic pharmacy. Consultations with a doctor are free; prescriptions from the 500 stocked medicines run from ₹20 to ₹2000. Additionally, it works with a government initiative that encourages struggling local farmers to turn over a new leaf planting Ayurvedic herbs.
THE VARANASI SHAKEDOWN
If you thought the touts and rickshaw-wallahs were annoying in Agra, wait till you get to Varanasi. The attention here, particularly around the ghats and the Old City, is incredible: you will have to put up with persistent offers from touts and drivers of ‘cheapest and best’ boat trips, guides, tour operators, travel agents, silk shops and money changers (to name a few). Take it in good humour but politely refuse.
Words to live by in Varanasi:
Don’t take photos at the ‘burning’ ghats and resist offers to ‘follow me for a better view', where you’ll be pressured for money and possibly be placed in an uncomfortable situation.
Do not go to any shop with a guide or autorickshaw driver. Be firm and don't do it. Ever. You will pay 40% to 60% more for your item due to insane commissions and you will be passively encouraging this practice. Do yourself a favour and walk there; or have your ride drop you a block away.
Imposter stores are rampant in Varanasi, usually spelled one letter off or sometimes exactly the same. The shops we have recommended are the real deal. Ask for a visiting card (ie business card) – if the info doesn't match, you have been had.
When negotiating with boatsmen, confirm the price and currency before setting out. They just love to say '100' and then at the end claim they meant dollars or euros.
Do not book unofficial guides, which are whom most guesthouses hire. If you want a guide, go through UP Tourism to avoid most of the hassles above. If not, have fun shopping.
Be wary of bhang lassis – these are made with hash (degraded cannabis) and can be very strong if that's not what you're looking for (robberies of intoxicated people have been reported).1 Volunteering

The cultural walks on offer from this foreigner-run agency specialising in themed walks explore beyond the most popular ghats and temples. Walks are usually available on a reservation basis and can be booked online. Five of the eight guides were born and raised in Varanasi. It's a truly fascinating way to explore beyond the Old City.
4 Sleeping The majority of Varanasi’s budget hotels – and some midrange gems – are concentrated in the tangle of narrow streets back from the ghats along the RiverGanges. There’s a concentration around Assi Ghat, while others are in the crazy, bustling northern stretch of alleys between Scindhia and Meer Ghat, part of an area we refer to as the Old City, though at time of writing, city officials had marked numerous unlicensed ghatside options, including some of our favorites, for demolition (whether it's carried out is another matter but 73 structures had been knocked down at time of writing). Check ahead for the current situation.
For those that prefer five-star luxury or aren't fussed about sleeping next to the river, there are some great choices in the neighbourhoods west of the river, such as Bhelpura, Aurangabad Rd and Cantonment.
Varanasi has an active paying-guesthouse scheme with more than 150 family homes available for accommodation from ₹150 to ₹900 a night (most are under ₹400). UP Tourism has a full list.

Good-hearted host Harish, a 30-year veteran of the textile industry (well-regarded, fixed-price shop on premises) has six exquisitely maintained deluxe and enormous super deluxe rooms that are shielded from light, noise and mosquitoes. You'll truly appreciate the rest.
His wife, Malika, whips up exquisite home-cooked meals and has been known to give impromptu cooking classes. If you don't mind being a bit away from the heart of the action, it's a delightful choice.

A true hostel has landed in Varanasi in a four-story residential mansion 2km or so from Assi Ghat. Dorms in six-, eight-and 12-bed variations are livened up by colourful lockers, and there's ample hang spaces on various floors that cultivate the right vibe – a previously scarce atmosphere in much of India.
The few privates are basic (save the marble bathtubs); the real coup here are the dorms, common areas and the rooftop showers, each uniquely painted by various artistic volunteers. The hostel plans all sorts of activities (from cooking classes to city tours), many of which are free save gratuities. It's a solid choice for the socially inclined – required training for staff includes legging it around India for a few weeks to gain traveller perspective.

Varanasi’s best hotel is on nearly 2 hectares of beautiful gardens with fruit trees, a tennis court, a pool, an outdoor yoga centre and the old maharaja’s guesthouse. All the rooms were madeover between 2010 and 2013.
There's little size difference between standard and deluxe categories, but the latter are far classier with refined art on the walls and more soothing colour schemes (a rich turquoise, for example). Service is expectedly top class and there are two fine restaurants, two bars and two spa treatment rooms (massages from ₹3000).
5 Eating Look out for locally grown langda aam (mangoes) in summer or sitafal (custard apples) in autumn.
Singharas are water chestnuts that are sold raw (green) or cooked (black) – be wary of the risk of intestinal parasites with the latter. Many places in the Old City shut during summer months due to unbearable humidity and water levels that often flood the ghats and around.

Pop in for the shockingly European breakfast buffet (7am to noon; ₹400), a hearty burger or just for a chai and respite from the heat and hassle. Part of the profits go to the charity Learn for Life. Warning: not to be confused with the location across the street, abandoned by Micha, the 5th-generation German baker, but carried on by his local ex-partners.

yoghurt shop that has been churning out the freshest, creamiest, fruit-filled lassis since 1925. The grandson of the original owner still works here, sitting by his lassi-mixing cauldron in front of a small room with wooden benches for customers and walls plastered with messages from happy drinkers. There are over 80 delicious flavour combos, divided by section – plain, banana, apple, pomegranate, mango, papaya, strawberry, blueberry, coconut and saffron – we think banana and apple, the latter flecked with fresh apple shreds, just about top the long list (what the hell, make it banana-apple). The whole scene here is surreal: the lassi takes ages to arrive while club-like tunes burrow into the eardrums of a UN-rivaling group of thirsty nationalities; when it does, it's handed off to you with the care of a priceless work of art as the deceased are carried by the front of the shop on the way to Burning Ghat (Manikarnika). Namaste.6 Drinking & Nightlife Wine and beer shops are dotted discreetly around the city, usually away from the river.
Note that it is frowned upon to drink alcohol on or near the holy Ganges, and liquor laws regarding proximity of temples insure nobody is licensed, but rooftops here can usually discreetly fashion up a beer. For bars, head to midrange and top-end hotels away from the ghats.

7 Shopping Varanasi is justifiably famous for silk brocades and beautiful Benares saris, but don't believe much of what the silk salesmen tell you about the relative quality of products, even in government emporiums. Instead, shop around and judge for yourself.Varanasi is also a good place to shop for sitars (ranging from ₹6000 to ₹60,000) and tablas (from ₹5000 to ₹15,000). The cost depends primarily on the type of wood used. Mango is cheapest (and cracks or warps correspondingly), while black shisham or mahogany are of the highest quality. Serious buyers should be sure to double-check their chosen wood isn't banned for export.

Prices are fixed (though unmarked) and the friendly owner refuses to play the commission game, so autorickshaws and taxis don't like to come here (ignore anyone who says you cannot drive here).

By train, go to Gorakhpur then transfer to a Sunauli bus.Air India has four weekly flights to Kathmandu (from ₹10,947). Nepali visas are available on arrival.
TRAIN
Luggage theft has been reported on trains to and from Varanasi so you should take extra care. Reports of drugged food and drink aren't uncommon, so it’s probably still best to politely decline any offers from strangers.
Varanasi Junction train station, also known as Varanasi Cantonment (Cantt), is the main station.
There are several daily trains to Allahabad, Gorakhpur and Lucknow. A few daily trains leave for New Delhi and Kolkata, but only two daily trains go to Agra. The direct train to Khajuraho only runs on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. On other days, go via Satna, a much larger rail transit hub from where you can catch buses to Khajuraho (₹120, 4 hours, 6.30am and 2.20pm).

GOOGLE MAP
 ; %7860154166; 1/105 Assi-Dham; h8am-7pm) near Assi Ghat.
CYCLE-RICKSHAW
A small ride – up to 2km – costs ₹50. Rough prices from Godaulia Crossing include: Assi Ghat ₹50, Benares Hindu University ₹60 and Varanasi Junction train station ₹60. Be prepared for hard bargaining.
TAXI & AUTORICKSHAW
Prepaid booths for autorickshaws and taxis are directly outside Varanasi Junction train station and give you a good benchmark for prices around town, though it doesn't work as well as some other cities as there are usually no officials policing it. Don't fall for, 'It's the old price' or any such shenanigans (until they post a new sign, the 'old price' stands).
First pay an administration charge (₹5 for autorickshaws, ₹10 for taxis) at the booth then take a ticket which you give to your driver, along with the fare, once you’ve reached your destination. Note that taxis and autorickshaws cannot access the Dashashwamedh Ghat area between the hours of 9am and 9pm due to high pedestrian traffic. You'll be dropped at Godaulia Crossing and will need to walk the remaining 400m or so to the entrance to the Old City; or 700m or so all the way to Dashashwamedh Ghat. During banned hours, autorickshaws line-up near Godaulia Crossing at a stand on Luxa Rd.
Sample fares:
A Airport auto/taxi ₹225/650
A Assi Ghat auto/taxi ₹90/300
A Godaulia Crossing auto/taxi ₹95/250 A Sarnath auto/taxi ₹120/400A Half-day tour (four hours) taxi ₹500
A Full-day tour (eight hours) taxi ₹900
Autorickshaws do not have a half/full day tour scheme. Shared autos to Assi Ghat (₹15) and Benares University (₹15) leave from Mandapur Rd and Durgakund Rd, respectively.
SARNATH
%0542
Buddha came to Sarnath to preach his message of the middle way to nirvana after he achieved enlightenment at Bodhgaya and gave his famous first sermon here. In the 3rd century BC, emperor Ashoka had magnificent stupas and monasteries erected here as well as an engraved pillar. When Chinese traveller Xuan Zang dropped by in AD 640, Sarnath boasted a 100m-high stupa and 1500 monks living in large monasteries. However, soon after, Buddhism went into decline and, when Muslim invaders sacked the city in the late 12th century, Sarnath disappeared altogether. It was ‘rediscovered’ by British archaeologists in 1835.
Today it’s one of the four key sites on the Buddhist circuit (along with Bodhgaya, Kushinagar and Lumbini in Nepal) and attracts followers from around the world, especially on Purnima (or, informally, Buddha's birthday), when Buddha's life, death and enlightenment are celebrated, usually in April or May.Sarnath

8 Getting There & Away Local buses to Sarnath (₹15, 40 minutes) pass in front of Varanasi Junction train station, but you may wait a long time for one. A prepaid autorickshaw costs ₹120 from Varanasi Junction train station (use that as your bargaining base if you catch one from the Old City). On the way back, you can snag a lift in a shared auto or vikram (₹15) to Pandeypur, where you'll need to switch to another shared auto to Benia Bagh (₹15), which is just a ₹20 cycle rickshaw ride from Godaulia. Some trains running between Varanasi and Gorakphur also stop here. Trains for Sarnath leave Varanasi Junction at 7am, 11.30am and 1.20pm. Returning to Varanasi, trains leave Sarnath at 9am, 7.30pm and 9.50pm. The journey takes around 20 minutes and a ‘general’ ticket for an unreserved 2nd-class seat will cost you just a few rupees.

The highlight of this modest temple, rebuilt in 1927 and set among extensive lawns and ancient excavated ruins with a circumambulatory path, is its serene 5th-century reclining Buddha, unearthed in 1876. Six metres long, it depicts Buddha on his ancient death-bed and is one of the world’s most moving Buddhist icons. Behind the temple is an ancient 19m-tall stupa (

Sunauli is a dusty town that offers little more than a bus stop, a couple of hotels, a few shops and a border post. The border is open 24 hours and the crossing is straightforward, so most travellers carry on into Nepal without stopping here. The Nepali side of Sunauli has a few cheap hotels, outdoor restaurants and a more upbeat atmosphere, but most travellers prefer to stay in Bhairawa, or get straight on a bus to Kathmandu or Pokhara.
Buses drop you just a few hundred metres from the Indian immigration office (and Jeeps at its doorstep), so you can ignore the cycle-rickshaws.

BUYER BEWARE
Be wary of buying ‘through’ tickets from Kathmandu or Pokhara to Varanasi. Some travellers report being intimidated into buying another ticket once over the border. Travelling in either direction, it’s better to take a local bus to the border, walk across and take another onward bus (pay the conductor on board). Travellers have also complained about being pressured into paying extra luggage charges for buses out of Sunauli. You shouldn't have to, so politely decline.
8 Getting There & Around Regular buses run from Sunauli to Gorakhpur (₹94, three hours, every 15 minutes, 4am to 7pm) from where you can catch trains to Varanasi. A few morning (4.30am, 5.30am, 6.30am and 7.30am) and afternoon (4.30pm, 5.30pm and 6.30pm) buses run direct to Varanasi (₹271, 11 hours), but it’s a long, bumpy ride. Faster collective cars and jeeps to Gorakhpur hang out alongside the road after Indian immigration and leave when full (₹150 to ₹300, two hours).

Famed for being the birthplace of the much-loved Hindu god Krishna, Mathura is one of Hinduism’s seven sacred cities and attracts floods of pilgrims, particularly during Janmastami (Krishna’s birthday) in August/September; and Holi in February/March. The town is dotted with temples from various ages and the stretch of the sacred Yamuna River which flows past here is lined with 25 ghats, best seen at dawn, when many people take their holy dip, and just after sunset, when hundreds of candles are sent floating out onto the river during theevening aarti ceremony.
Mathura was once a Buddhist centre with 20 monasteries that housed 3000 monks but, after the rise of Hinduism, and later sackings by Afghan and Mughal rulers, today all that’s left of the oldest sights are the beautiful sculptures recovered from ruins, now on display in the Archaeological Museum.Mathura

UttarakhandWhy Go?
Soaring Himalayan peaks and steamy lowland jungles. Revered temples and renowned ashrams. Peaceful hill stations and busy cities. Uttarakhand is an enticingly diverse state, with some of India’s best trekking, yoga schools, holiday towns and wildlife-watching all tucked into one little corner of the country.
Hindus think of Uttarakhand as Dev Bhoomi – the Land of Gods – and the dramatic terrain is covered with holy mountains, lakes and rivers. Twisting roads and high-altitude hiking trails lead to spectacular pilgrimage sites where tales from the Hindu epics are set. And something of these ancient stories seems to have been absorbed by the land, which exudes a subtle sense of actually being sacred – even to ultra-orthodox agnostics.
Many travellers flock here for this vibe, finding it a powerful place to pursue a spiritual practice. Others come here to spot tigers.
When to GoA Apr–mid-Jun The best season for tiger spotting at Corbett Tiger Reserve. A Jul–mid-Sep Monsoons may make travel difficult; Valley of Flowers blooms July and August.

History Uttarakhand consists of two culturally distinct districts: Garhwal (in the west) and Kumaon (to the east). Over the centuries various dynasties have dominated the region, including the Guptas, Kuturyi and Chand rajas. In the 18th century the Nepalese Gurkhas attacked first the kingdom of Kumaon, then Garhwal, prompting the British to step in and take most of the region as part of the Sugauli Treaty in 1816.
After Independence, the region was merged with Uttar Pradesh, but a vocal separatist movement followed, and the present-day state of Uttaranchal was formed in 2000. In 2007 it was officially renamed Uttarakhand, a traditional name meaning ‘northern country’.
1 Climate Temperatures are determined by altitude in this state of elevation extremes. Trekking the Himalayas is possible from May to October, but can be dangerous between July and mid-September, during the monsoon, when violent cloudbursts cause landslides. Hill stations offer a welcome escape from summertime heat, while lowlying Rishikesh is most comfortable from October to March.8 Information Most towns in the region have an Uttarakhand Tourism office; the main responsibility for the region’s tourism, however, rests with the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN;
www.gmvnl.com), in the Garhwal district and Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam
(KMVN; www.kmvn.org), in the Kumaon district.
TOP STATE FESTIVALS
Magh Mela (Haridwar; hJan & Feb) Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims come to bathe in the soul-cleansing Ganges during this huge annual religious fair. The Ardh Kumbh Mela is held every six years; and millions of pilgrims attend the mega Kumbh Mela every 12 years. International Yoga Festival Rishikesh hosts the International Yoga Festival, attracting swamis and yoga masters from around the world for discourses and lectures. Most of the action is centred on the Parmarth Niketan Ashram in Swarg Ashram. Check the festival website for dates.
Shivaratri (Tapkeshwar Temple; husually Mar) A festival celebrated in style with carnival rides and stalls at a picturesque riverside cave temple on the outskirts of Dehra Dun. Nanda Devi Fair During this five-day fair, devotees parade the image of the goddess in towns around Kumaon. There's also dancing and cultural shows.
8 Getting Around Tough old government buses are the main means of travelling around Uttarakhand. In addition, crowded shared jeeps criss-cross the state, linking remote towns and villages to important road junctions. Pay 10 times the share-taxi rate to hire the whole vehicle and travel in comfort. Roads that snake through the hills can be nerve-racking and stomach-churning, and are sometimes blocked by monsoon-season landslides.
RISHIKESH
%0135 Pop 102,160 Elev 356m
Ever since the Beatles rocked up at the ashram of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the late ‘60s, Rishikesh has been a magnet for spiritual seekers. Today it styles itself as the ‘Yoga Capital of the World’, with masses of ashrams and all kinds of yoga and meditation classes. Most of this action is north of the main town,where the exquisite setting on the fast-flowing Ganges, surrounded by forested hills, is conducive to meditation and mind expansion. In the evening, an almost supernatural breeze blows down the valley, setting temple bells ringing as sadhus (spiritual men), pilgrims and tourists prepare for the nightly ganga aarti (a fire offering or ritual performed on the Ganges). You can learn to play the sitar or tabla; you can try Hasya yoga (laughter therapy), practise humming or gong meditation, or even take a punt on crystal healing.
But Rishikesh is not all spirituality and contorted limbs; it's now a popular white-water rafting centre, backpacker hang-out, and gateway to treks in the Himalaya.
Rishikesh is divided into two main areas: the crowded, unattractive downtown area (Rishikesh town), where you’ll find the bus and train stations as well as the Triveni Ghat (a popular and auspicious bathing ghat and place of prayer on the Ganges); and the riverside communities 2km upstream around Ram Jhula and Lakshman Jhula, where most of the accommodation, ashrams, restaurants and travellers are ensconced. The two jhula (suspension bridges) that cross the river are pedestrian-only – though scooters and motorcycles freely use them. Swarg Ashram, located on the eastern bank, is the traffic-free ‘spiritual centre’ of Rishikesh, while High Bank, west of Lakshman Jhula, is a small enclave popular with backpackers.Rishikesh

Lakshman Jhula & Around
The defining image of Rishikesh is the view across the Lakshman Jhula hangingbridge to the huge, 13-storey wedding-cake temple of Swarg Niwas & Shri
Trayanbakshwar ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ). Built by the organisation of the guru
Kailashanand, it resembles a fairyland castle and has dozens of shrines to Hindu deities on each level, interspersed with jewellery and textile shops. Sunset is an especially good time to photograph the temple from the bridge itself, and you’ll hear the bell-clanging and chanting of devotees in the morning and evening. Shops selling devotional CDs add to the cacophony of noise on this side of the river. Markets, restaurants, ashrams and guesthouses sprawl on both sides of the river; in recent years the area has grown into the busiest and liveliest part of upper Rishikesh.
Swarg Ashram
A pleasant 2km walk south of Lakshman Jhula, along the path skirting the east bank of the Ganges, leads to the spiritual community of Swarg Ashram, made up of temples, ashrams, a crowded bazaar, sadhus and the bathing ghats (steps or landing on a river) where religious ceremonies are performed at sunrise and sunset. The colourful, though rather touristy, ganga aarti is held at the riverside temple of the Parmarth Niketan Ashram every evening around sunset, with singing, chanting, musicians and the lighting of candles.

Just south of Swarg Ashram, slowly being consumed by the forest undergrowth, is what’s left of the original Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashram. It was abandoned in 1997 and is now back under the control of the forest department. However, the shells of many buildings, meditation cells and lecture halls can still be seen, including Maharishi’s own house and the guesthouse where the Beatles stayed and apparently wrote much of the White Album.
The once-striking art installation called The Beatles Cathedral Gallery has become a graffiti free-for-all, but it's still worth seeing.2 Activities
Yoga & Meditation
Yoga and meditation are ubiquitous in India's yoga capital. Teaching and yoga styles vary tremendously, so check out a few classes and ask others about their experiences before committing yourself to a course. Many places also offer ayurvedic massage, and some residential ashrams have strict rules forbidding students from consuming drugs, alcohol, tobacco and meat during their stay.

THE MAHARISHI & THE BEATLES
In February 1968, Rishikesh hit world headlines when the Beatles and their partners stayed at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s ashram in Swarg Ashram, following an earlier visit by George Harrison. Ringo Starr and his wife didn’t like the vegetarian food, missed their children and left after a couple of weeks, but the others stayed for a month or two. They relaxed and wrote tons of songs, many of which ended up on their double album White Album. But rumours of the Maharishi’s demands for money and his behaviour towards some female disciples eventually disillusioned all of them. ‘You made a fool of everyone’, John Lennon sang about the Maharishi. In later years, Harrison and Paul McCartney said, on record, that the rumours were unfounded. The original ashram is now abandoned, but nearly 40 years on, idealistic foreigners still swarm into Rishikesh seeking spiritual enlightenment from teachers and healers in their tranquil ashrams scattered along the Ganges River.
Rafting, Kayaking & Trekking
More than 100 operators offer full-and half-day rafting trips, launching upstreamand paddling down to Rishikesh. Some also offer multiday rafting trips, with camping along the river. The official rafting season runs from 15 September to 30 June. A half-day trip starts at about ₹1000 per person, while a full day costs from ₹1800. Most companies also offer all-inclusive Himalayan treks to places such as Kuari Pass, Har-ki Dun and Gangotri/Tapovan from around ₹3500 per day.

7 Shopping Swarg Ashram is the place to go for bookshops, ayurvedic herbal medicines, clothing, handicrafts and tourist trinkets such as jewellery and Tibetan singing bowls, though there are also plenty of stalls around Lakshman Jhula. Many stalls sell rudraksh mala, the strings of beads used in puja (literally 'respect'; offering or prayers). They are made from the nuts of the rudraksh tree, which originally grew where Shiva shed a single tear following a particularly long and satisfyingperiod of meditation. Beads with mukhi (different faces) confer various blessings on the wearer.
If you need outdoor gear, your best bet is Adventure Axis (

from sleeping bags and carabiners to drysuits and trekking boots.
8 Information
DANGERS & ANNOYANCES
Be cautious of befriending sadhus – while some are on genuine spiritual journeys, the orange robes have been used as a disguise by fugitives from the law since medieval times, and people have been robbed and worse.
The current in some parts of the Ganges is very strong and people occasionally drown here. Don’t swim beyond your depth.

8 Getting There & Away
BUS
There are regular buses to Haridwar and Dehra Dun; for Mussoorie change at Dehra Dun. Buses run north to pilgrimage centres during the yatra (pilgrimage) season (April to November), and to Joshimath and Uttarkashi year-round. Buses to Gangotri were infrequent at the time of research.
Private AC and Volvo buses run to Delhi (₹600 to ₹830, seven hours) several times a day. There’s also one direct overnight bus daily from Rishikesh to Dharamsala (₹950) at 4pm.
Private night buses to Jaipur (seat/sleeper/AC sleeper ₹500/600/1100, 13 hours) and Pushkar (₹500/600, 16 hours) can be booked at travel agents in Lakshman Jhula, Swarg Ashram and High Bank, but they leave from Haridwar.You can also book a bus to Agra (₹840, 12 hours) that departs from Dehradun.
SHARE JEEPS & TAXI
Share jeeps leave, when overfull, from the corner of Dehra Dun Rd and Dhalwala Bypass Rd, to Uttarkashi (₹300, five hours) and Joshimath (₹400, eight hours), mostly early in the morning, starting from 4am.
Private taxis can be hired from Lakshman Jhula, Ram Jhula, and in between the main and yatra bus stands. Rates to various destinations include: Haridwar (₹810, one hour), Dehra Dun (₹1220, 1½ hours), Jolly Grant Airport (₹710, one hour), Uttarkashi (for Gangotri; ₹3570, seven hours), Joshimath (₹5610, nine hours) and Almora (₹7200, 10 hours). For long-distance trips you may find a cheaper rate by asking around at travel agents and guesthouses.
Vikrams (large autorickshaws) charge ₹400 to make the trip to Haridwar.
TRAIN
Very few trains run from Rishikesh itself, so your best bet is to take a bus or taxi to the railway station in Haridwar and hop on board there. Bookings, even for trains from Haridwar, can be made at the railway station in Rishikesh, or at travel agents around Lakshman Jhula and Swarg Ashram (for a fee).
8 Getting Around Shared vikrams run from the downtown Ghat Rdjunction up past Ram Jhula (₹10 per person) and the High Bank turn-off to Lakshman Jhula. To hire the entire vikram from downtown to Lakshman Jhula should cost ₹80 to 'upside' – the top of the hill on which the Lakshman Jhula area sits – and ₹100 to
'downside' – closer to the bridge. From Ram Jhula to High Bank or Lakshman Jhula is ₹40.
To get to the eastern bank of the Ganges you either need to walk across one of
the suspension bridges or take the ferry ( 
h7.30am-6.15pm) from Ram Jhula.

On the eastern bank of the Ganges, taxis and share jeeps wait to take passengers to waterfalls and Neelkantha temple (shared/private ₹120/1000), but it’s a 16km trip by road to get from one side of the river to the other. Lakshman Jhula to Swarg Ashram costs ₹10 in a shared jeep, or ₹80 if you don't wish to share.
Bicycles (per day ₹100), scooters (per day ₹300) and motorcycles (per day ₹400 to ₹700) can be hired around the Lakshman Jhula area. There are no actual shops – rent from guys on the street or ask at guesthouses.
HARIDWAR
%01334 Pop 225,235 Elev 249m
Propitiously located at the point where the Ganges emerges from the Himalaya, Haridwar (also called Hardwar) is Uttarakhand’s holiest Hindu city, and pilgrims arrive here in droves to bathe in the fast-flowing Ganges. The sheer number of people gathering around Har-ki-Pairi Ghat give Haridwar a chaotic but reverent feel. Within the religious hierarchy of India, Haridwar is much more significant than Rishikesh, an hour further north, and every evening the river comes alive with flickering flames as floating offerings are released onto the Ganges. It's especially busy during the yatra (pilgrimage) season from May to October, and is the site of the annual Magh Mela religious festival.
Haridwar’s main street is Railway Rd, becoming Upper Rd, which runs parallel to the Ganges canal (the river proper runs further to the east). Generally only cycle-rickshaws are allowed between Laltarao Bridge and Bhimgoda Jhula (Bhimgoda Bridge), so vehicles travel around the opposite bank of the river. The(        g             g)

 )
Har-ki-Pairi (The Footstep of God) is where Vishnu is said to have dropped some divine nectar and left behind a footprint. Every evening hundreds of worshippers gather for the ganga aarti. Officials in blue uniforms collect donations and, as the sun sets, bells ring out a rhythm, torches are lit, and leaf baskets with flower petals inside and a candle on top (₹10) are lit and placed on the river to drift away downstream.
Tourists can mingle with the crowd to experience the rituals of an ancient religion that still retains its power in the modern age. Someone may claim to be a priest and help you with your puja before asking for ₹200 or more. If you want to make a donation, it's best to give to a uniformed collector.
The best times to visit the ghat are early morning or just before dusk.Mansa Devi & Chandi Devi Temples
HINDU TEMPLE
 
Take the cable car (return ₹58; h7am-7pm Apr-Oct, 8am-6.30pm Nov-Mar) to the crowded
hilltop temple of Mansa Devi, a wish-fulfilling goddess. The path to the cable car is lined with stalls selling packages of prasad (a food offering used in religious ceremonies) to bring to the goddess on the hill. You can walk up (1.5km) but beware of prasad-stealing monkeys.
Many visitors and pilgrims combine this with another cable car (return ₹102; h8am-6pm) up Neel Hill, 4km southeast of Haridwar, to Chandi Devi Temple. The temple was built by Raja Suchet Singh of Kashmir in 1929.
Pay ₹210 at Mansa Devi and you can ride both cable cars and take an AC coach between the two temples. Photography is forbidden inside the shrines.

Sanjeev Mehta of Mohan’s Adventure Tours can organise any kind of tour, including trekking, fishing, birdwatching, cycling, motorcycling and rafting. An accomplished wildlife photographer, he specialises in five-hour safaris (₹2350 per person with two or more, singles pay ₹2950) within Rajaji National Park. Sanjeev also runs overnight trips to Corbett Tiger Reserve (from ₹9950). Tours operate year-round.
4 Sleeping Haridwar has loads of hotels catering to Hindu pilgrims. The busiest time of year is the yatra season from April to November – outside this you should have no problem finding a room at discounts of 20% to 50%.
Jassa Ram Rd and the other alleys running off Railway Rd have plenty of budget hotels, and although some of the fancy foyers and neon signs may raise your hopes, none are great. Rishikesh has far superior budget accommodation.Down by the ghats are a number of high-rise hotels that have good views but worse-than-average rooms.

Currently the best of the budget choices, the Arjun beats its neighbours for cleanliness and comfort. Some rooms have balconies. Most have their quirks, though – one a broken TV, another a dead overhead light – so take a look at a few if you can. It's walking distance from the train and bus stations.

One of Haridwar's few solid midrange choices, La Casa boasts some of the least scuffed rooms in town. It strives for character, with splashes of colour, tasteful furnishings and modern bathrooms. In all, good value (though not quite as nice as it looks on the hotel website).

Hidden away in Bara Bazaar, but right on the Ganges, this superb 1918 haveli (traditional, ornately decorated residence) is Haridwar’s finest hotel. Interior courtyards and marble floors give it a regal charm. It's worth shelling out extra for a Ganges View room, with an airy balcony overlooking the river.Room rates include breakfast, steam bath, yoga and the hotel’s own ganga aarti on its private ghat. A rooftop ayurvedic health spa offers treatments. It’s hard to find, so call ahead for a pick-up.

8 Getting There & Away Haridwar is well connected by bus and train, but book ahead for trains during the pilgrimage season (May to October).
BUS
Private deluxe buses buses run to Delhi (₹400), Agra (seat/sleeper ₹450/550), Jaipur (₹450/550) and Pushkar (₹550/650). Some leave from a bus stand (
GOOGLE MAP
 ) around the corner from the GMVN tourist office by the
gurdwara (Sikh temple). It's best to ask the travel agent who makes your booking where to find your bus.TAXI
The main taxi stand ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Railway Rd) is outside the train station.
Destinations include Chilla (for Rajaji National Park, ₹570), Rishikesh (₹820, one hour) and Dehra Dun (₹1320), but it’s usually possible to arrange a taxi for less than these official rates. You can hire private jeep Sumos to go to one or all of the pilgrimage sites on the Char Dham between April and October. One-wayrates to single temples range from ₹6550 to ₹7550; a nine-day tour of all four is ₹22,600. Taxis to Jolly Grant Airport cost ₹1120.
8 Getting Around Cycle-rickshaws cost ₹10 for a short distance and ₹30 for longer hauls, such as from the Haridwar train station to Har-ki-Pairi. Shared vikrams run up and down Railway Rd (₹10) and all the way to Rishikesh (₹40, one hour) from Upper Rd at Laltarao Bridge, but for that trip buses are more comfortable. Hiring a taxi for three hours to tour the local temples and ashrams costs around
₹800; an autorickshaw costs ₹350.
RAJAJI NATIONAL PARK
Elev 300-1000mUnspoilt Rajaji National Park (www.rajajinationalpark.in; Indian/foreigner per day ₹150/600, vehicle fee ₹250/500; h15 Nov–15 Jun), covering 820 sq km in the forested foothills
near Haridwar, is best known for its wild elephants, numbering around 600 at last count.
As well as elephants, the park contains some 250 leopards and 11 tigers, and at the time of writing, Rajaji was under consideration for being declared an official tiger reserve. These big cats, which are not easily seen, have thousands of chital (spotted deer) and hundreds of sambars (India’s largest species of deer) to feed on. The park is also home to a handful of rarely seen sloth bears and some 300 species of birds.
Rajaji’s forests include the traditional winter territory of more than 1000 families of nomadic Van Gujjar buffalo herders – most of whom have been evicted from the park against their will. For more on this and other issues affecting the unique Van Gujjar tribe, visit www.sophiaindia.org.
The village of Chilla, 13km northeast of Haridwar, is the base for visiting the park. At the Forest Ranger’s office, close to the tourist guesthouse at Chilla, you can pick up a brochure, pay entry fees and organise a jeep. These take up to eight people and cost ₹1100 for the standard safari (plus a ₹500 entry fee for the vehicle). Elephant rides are no longer offered at Rajaji.
Before visiting, contact the GMVN tourist office in Haridwar and Mohan’s Adventure Tours, which offers abridged safaris even when the park is officially closed. These five-hour trips (₹2350 per person) include a short safari, during which you'll hopefully see a parade of wild elephants, and maybe visit a Van Gujjar forest camp.
4 Sleeping & Eating The Chilla Guesthouse (%0138- 266678; www.gmvnl.com; r from ₹2090; a) is the GMVN rest house and the most comfortable place to stay in Chilla. The guesthouse has a good restaurant and a pleasant garden.
You can stay inside the park at one of the rest houses run by the Forest Department. For information and reservations, contact the director at the Rajaji National Park Office (%0135-2621669; Dehra Dun). Mohan’s Adventure Tours canalso make bookings.
Also within the park, the Camp King Elephant (%9871604712; cottage incl full
board, Indian/foreigner from ₹8500/US$240) resort has solar electricity, private bathrooms,
full meal service and optional jeep tours.
8 Getting There & Away Buses to Chilla (₹30, one hour) leave the GMOU bus stand in Haridwar every hour from 7am to 2pm. The last return trip leaves Chilla at 5.30pm. Taxis charge ₹650 one way for the 13km journey.
DEHRA DUN

Perhaps best known for the institutions the British left behind – the huge Forest Research Institute Museum, the Indian Military Academy, the Wildlife Institute of India and the Survey of India – the capital of Uttarakhand is a hectic, congested city sprawling in the Doon Valley between the Himalayan foothills and the Siwalik Range. Most travellers merely pass through on their way to nearby Rishikesh, Haridwar, Mussoorie or Himachal Pradesh, but if you have time, there's enough to do here to make Dehra Dun worth a stop.Dehra Dun

Mindrolling Monastery
MONASTERY
(%0135-2640556; www.mindrolling.org)
The region around Dehra Dun is home to a thriving Tibetan Buddhist community, mainly focused on this monastery, about 10km south of the centre in Clement Town. Everything here is on a grand scale: at over 60m tall its Great Stupa (h5am-9pm) is believed to be the world’s tallest stupa and contains a series of shrine rooms displaying relics, murals and Tibetan art. Presiding over the monastery is the impressive 35m-high gold Sakyamuni Buddha Statue , dedicated to the Dalai Lama.
The streets around the monastery are lined with Tibetan cafes. Unfortunately, due to new government regulations, foreigners are no longer allowed to stayovernight in Clement Town – but the manager of the Devaloka House hotel on the monastery grounds is willing to bend the rules. Simple rooms cost ₹350; the bed sheets have seen better days. Take vikram 5 from the city centre (₹10). An autorickshaw costs about ₹150.
Forest Research Institute Museum
NOTABLE BUILDING
(%0135-2759382; www.icfre.org; admission ₹10, guide ₹50; h9.30am-4.30pm Mon-Fri)
The prime attraction of this museum is the building itself. Set in a 5-sq-km park, this grand remnant of the Raj era – where most of India’s forest officers are trained – is larger than Buckingham Palace. Built between 1924 and 1929, this red-brick colossus has Mughal towers, perfectly formed arches and Roman columns in a series of quadrangles edged by elegant cloisters. Six huge halls have displays on Indian forestry that look like leftovers from a middle-school science fair.
Highlights include beautiful animal, bird and plant paintings by Afshan Zaidi, exhibits on the medicinal uses of trees, and a cross-section of a 700-year-old deodar tree. A return autorickshaw from the city centre, including waiting time, costs around ₹300. Or take vikram 6 from Connaught Place and get out at the institute’s entry gate.

To get permission, go to the Surveyor General’s office at the Survey of India Compound in Harthibarkala. There, you’ll have to write a brief letter explaining why you want to view the collection. Permits are given only to those with an academic or professional interest in the subject – like a geography student or a historian – but proof of your vocation or college major isn’t demanded.

Turn left at the bottom of the steps for the main shrine. Cross the bridge over the river to visit another shrine, where you have to squeeze through a narrow cave to see an image of Mata Vaishno Devi.
The temple is about 5km north of the centre. Take a rickshaw for ₹300 (round trip).

8 Getting There & Away
AIR
A few airlines (Jet Airways, SpiceJet and Air India) fly daily between Delhi and Dehra Dun’s Jolly Grant Airport – about 20km east of the city on the Haridwar road – with fares starting at around ₹3200 each way. A taxi to/from the airport costs ₹600, or take the AC coach for ₹100 (call the Uttarakhand Tourism office for times).
BUS
Nearly all long-distance buses arrive and depart from the huge Interstate Bus Terminal (ISBT), 5km south of the city centre. To get there take a local bus (₹5), vikram 5 (₹10) or an autorickshaw (₹100). A few buses to Mussoorie leave from here but most depart from the Mussoorie bus stand ( 
MAPGOOGLE MAP
 ) (₹56, 1½ hours, half-hourly between 6am and 8pm) next to the
train station. Some head to Mussoorie’s Picture Palace bus stand while others go to the Library bus stand across town. There are also buses from the Mussoorie bus stand to Barkot – for Yamnotri – (₹218, five hours, 5.30am, 7.30am and 12pm); Purola – for Har-Ki-Dun – (₹227, seven hours, 6.30am and 1.30pm); Uttarkashi (₹250, seven hours, 5.30am) and Joshimath (₹480, 12 hours,
5.30am).
Private buses to Joshimath (₹370, 12 hours, 7am) and Uttarkashi (via Mussoorie ₹200, seven hours, 7am and 1.30pm; or via Chamba ₹280, eight
hours, 8am and 12.30pm) leave from the Parade Ground bus stand (

TRAIN
Dehra Dun is well connected by train to Delhi, and there are a handful of services to Lucknow, Varanasi, Chennai (Madras) and Kolkata (Calcutta). Of the multiple daily trains from Dehra Dun to Delhi, the best are the expresses: Shatabdi (chair/executive ₹730/1390, six hours, train 12018, 5pm); Janshatabdi (2nd class/chair ₹160/515, six hours, train 12056, 5.10am) and Nanda Devi Express (3AC/2AC/1st Class ₹590/280/1365, six hours, train 12206, 11.30pm).
The overnight Dehradun–Amritsar Express (sleeper/3A/1st Class
₹270/725/850, 12 hours) to Amritsar departs nightly at 7.40pm.
8 Getting Around Hundreds of eight-seater vikrams (₹5 to ₹10 per trip) race along five fixed routes (look at the front for the number). Most useful is vikram 5, which runs between the ISBT stand, the train station and Rajpur Rd, and as far south as the Tibetan colony at Clement Town. Vikram 1 runs up and down Rajpur Rd above Gandhi Park, and also to Harthibarkala (check with the driver to see which route he’s on). Autorickshaws cost ₹30 for a short distance,₹120 from ISBT to the city centre or ₹160 per hour for touring around the city.
MUSSOORIE
%0135 Pop 29,500 Elev 2000m
Perched on a ridge 2km high, the ‘Queen of Hill Stations’ vies with Nainital as Uttarakhand’s favourite holiday destination. When the mist clears, views of the green Doon Valley and the distant white-capped Himalayan peaks are superb, and in the hot months the cooler temperatures and fresh mountain air make a welcome break from the plains below.
Established by the British in 1823, Mussoorie became hugely popular with the Raj set. The ghosts of that era linger on in the architecture of the churches, libraries, hotels and summer palaces. The town is swamped with visitors between May and July, when it can seem like a tacky holiday camp for families and honeymooners, but at other times many of the 300 hotels have vacancies and their prices drop dramatically. During monsoon, the town is often shrouded in clouds.

Beyond Kulri Bazaar a narrow road leads 1.5km to Landour Bazaar.

From midway along the Mall, a cable car (

 ; return ₹75;
h8am-10pm May-Jul & Oct, 10am-7pm Aug-Sep & late Nov-Apr) runs up to Gun Hill (2530m),
which, on a clear day, has views of several big peaks. A steep path also winds up to the viewpoint. The most popular time to go up is an hour or so before sunset. There’s a minicarnival atmosphere in high season, with kids’ rides, food stalls, magic shops and honeymooners having their photos taken in Garhwali costumes.
2 Activities
WalksWhen the clouds don’t get in the way, the walks around Mussoorie offer great
views. Camel’s Back Rd ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) is a popular 3km promenade from
Kulri Bazaar to Gandhi Chowk, and passes a rock formation that looks like a camel. There are a couple of good mountain viewpoints along the way, and you can ride a rickshaw (one way/return ₹150/300) along the trail if you start from the Gandhi Chowk end. An enjoyable, longer walk (5km one way) starts at the
Picture Palace Cinema (

 ), goes past Union Church (

GOOGLE MAP
 ) and the clock tower to Landour and the Sisters’ Bazaar
area.
West of Gandhi Chowk, a more demanding walk is to the Jwalaji Temple on Benog Hill (about 20km return) via Cloud's End Hotel. The route passes through thick forest and offers some fine views. Taking a taxi to Cloud's End (₹550) cuts the walk by more than half. A slightly shorter walk is to the abandoned Everest House (16km return), former residence of Sir George Everest, first surveyor-general of India and namesake of the world’s highest mountain. You can also take a cycle rickshaw (₹130) to Park Toll, cutting 5km off the distance.

One of India’s leading schools for teaching conversational Hindi at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. There’s an enrolment fee of ₹500, and course books are an extra ₹2000.T Tours A full day of sightseeing around Mussoorie by taxi costs around ₹3000, including visits to the popular and overdeveloped Kempty Falls, 15km west, and to Dhanolti, a serene spot 25km east, set in deodar forests with Himalayan views.
The GMVN Booth can organise a number of local bus tours, including to Kempty Falls (three-hour tour ₹125), as well as further reaching full-day tours (from ₹250). Tours can also be booked at the Uttarakhand Tourism Office on the Lower Mall.
4 Sleeping Peak season is summer (May to July) when hotel prices shoot to ridiculous heights. There’s a midseason during the honeymoon period around October and November, and over Christmas and New Year, and these are the prices we list unless specified. At other times you should be able to get a bargain.
Budget places are scarce – you’ll find some dives near Picture Palace. But many hotels offer budget rates out of season.

This famous Mussoorie hotel, built in 1902, has recently reopened after undergoing a seven-year renovation. Inside and out, the public spaces are magnificent, imparting a regal aesthetic with none of the run-down air that often infuses historic properties. Bedrooms, however, feel strangely generic and, at the time of research, the reputation of the service wasn't stellar.
5 Eating & Drinking Most of Mussoorie’s best eating places are at the Kulri Bazaar and Picture Palace end of town. True to the holiday feel there are lots of fast-food places, and most hotels have their own restaurants. There

8 Getting There & Away
BUS
Frequent buses head to Mussoorie (₹56, 1½ hours) from Dehra Dun’s Mussoorie
bus stand. Some go to the Picture Palace bus stand ( %0135-2632259) while others go to the Library bus stand (

GOOGLE MAP
 ;
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
; %0135-2632258) at the other end of town – if you know where you’re staying, it helps to be on the right bus. There's no direct transport from Mussoorie to Rishikesh or Haridwar – change at Dehra Dun.
To reach the mountain villages of western Garhwal, grab one of the buses passing through Gandhi Chowk. For Yamunotri, hop on a bus to Barkot (₹140,3½ hours, departs around 6.30am, 8.30am and 1pm), then transfer to another to Janki Chatti (₹60, three hours). A couple of buses go to Purola (₹200, five hours, departs around 7.30am and 2.30pm). For Uttarkashi, leave from the Tehri bus stand at Landour and change at Chamba, or go to Barkot and transfer there.
TAXI
From taxi stands at both bus stands you can hire taxis to Dehra Dun (₹710) and Rishikesh (₹2200), or Uttarkashi (₹4500). A shared taxi to Dehra Dun should cost ₹140 per person.

THE CHAR DHAM
High in the Garhwali Himalayas sit some of the holiest sites in the Hindu religion – Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath – where temples mark the spiritual sources of four sacred rivers: the Yamuna, the Ganges, the Mandakini and the Alaknanda. Together, they make up one of the most important yatra circuits in all of India, known as the char dham (four seats). Every year between April and November, hundreds of thousands of worshippers brave hair-raising mountain roads and high-altitude trails to reach them. Or they did, anyway…
In June 2013, a torrential cloudburst produced an epic flood that swept away entire villages – and thousands of local people and pilgrims. The official death toll was around 6000, but locals insist the real number was closer to 50,000. Since then, many would-be pilgrims have stayed home, afraid that tragedy might repeat itself. The people and goverment of Uttarakhand are desperately hoping torebuild confidence in the area's safety, to revive the region's main economic engine. We expect the yatra's popularity will begin to rebound after a few seasons without a major catastrophe.
Even now, travelling to one or more of these temples is a great way to get a feel for the religious pulse of the subcontinent, amid incredible alpine scenery. Numerous buses, share jeeps, porters, ponies and palanquins are on hand for transport, and there's a well-established network of guesthouses, ashrams and government rest houses. As a result, getting to these temples is easy enough without hiring guides or carrying supplies, as long as the roads leading to them aren't blocked by monsoon-inspired landslides. And Gangotri and Badrinath temples can be visited without even having to hike.
Yamunotri
Elev 3185m
Yamunotri Temple is tucked in a tight gorge close to the source of the Yamuna, Hinduism’s second-most sacred river after the Ganges. Yamunotri is the least visited and therefore least developed of the char dham sites, but once you get to the trailhead it’s an easy trek in.
The 5km, 1½-hour hike begins at the tiny village of Janki Chatti. At Yamunotri Temple there are several hot-spring pools where you can take a dip, and others where pilgrims cook potatoes and rice as prasad. You'll find plenty of priests to help you make puja for a price. One kilometre beyond the temple, the Yamuna River spills from a frozen lake of ice and glaciers on the Kalinda Parvat mountain at an altitude of 4421m, but this is a very tough climb that requires mountaineering skills.
Across the river from Janki Chatti is the friendly village of Kharsali, which is worth a stroll if you have the time.
Accommodation is available at basic guesthouses or the GMVN tourist lodges in Janki Chatti and Hanuman Chatti.
During peak yatra season (May to June), buses run from Dehra Dun, Mussoorie and Rishikesh to Janki Chatti, but the most frequent transport services originate in Barkot. Buses (three hours, ₹60) depart Barkot for Janki Chatti at9am, 1pm and 3pm; they make return runs to Barkot at 6am, 8.30am and 2pm. You can find sporadic share jeeps making the same runs (₹80, 2½ hours). A private taxi costs about ₹2000 each way.
Gangotri & Gaumukh Glacier Trek
%01377 / Elev 3042m
In a remote setting at an altitude of 3042m, Gangotri Temple is one of the holiest places in India. Near the source of the Ganges (known as the Bhagirathi until it reaches Devprayag), the shrine is dedicated to the origin of Hinduism’s most sacred river. Nearby is the rock on which Shiva is said to have cushioned the impact of the water in his matted locks as it poured from the heavens, saving the earth from the destructive force of this great gift.
Erected by Gorkha commander Amar Singh Thapa in the 18th century, the temple – for a site of such significance – is surprisingly underwhelming. Unless you’re a devout Hindu, to get a real sense of awe you’ll probably have to trek from Gangotri to the true source of the river, at Gaumukh, 18km upstream. There, the water flows out of Gangotri Glacier beneath the soaring west face of Bhagirathi Parvat (6856m), with the peak of Shivling (the 6543m ‘Indian Matterhorn’) towering to the south.
Don’t be daunted by the trek – the trail rises gradually and is completely solid. 14km (four to six hours) up the trail, at Bhojbasa (3790m), there’s a GMVN Tourist Bungalow (%01377-222221; Bhojbasa; dm ₹350) and other basic lodging; Gaumukh is 4km (1½ hours) past that. On clear days, the best time to visit the source is early to midafternoon, when it’s out of the shadows. Porters (₹500 each way) and horses (one way/return ₹850/1250) can be hired in Gangotri. More ambitious hikers with camping gear often continue to the gorgeous meadow at Tapovan, 6km beyond Gaumukh.
Before trekking to Gaumukh, you must first get a permit, since access is limited to 150 people per day. This can be obtained from the District Forest
Office (%01377-225693; h10am-5pm Mon-Sat, closed 2nd Sat of month), 3km north of the
Uttarkashi bus stand, or from the satellite office above the bus stand at Gangotri, which is open every day from 8am to 10am and 5pm to 7pm. At both places,you'll need to bring a copy of your passport ID page and visa. The permit is valid for two days and costs ₹150/600 per Indian/foreigner (then ₹50/250 for each extra day).
Gangotri village has plenty of guesthouses, ashrams and dharamsalas (pilgrims' rest houses) charging ₹300 or less per room. When hungry, follow the Indian families to the Hotel Gangaputra Restaurant (mains ₹60-150; h7am- 11pm), which is busy for a good reason.
At the time of writing, buses to and from Gangotri were sporadic and unpredictable. Service may become more regular once road improvements are complete. For now, the best way to get back and forth is by shared jeep (₹200) or private taxi (one way/return ₹3000/4000). To Rishikesh, shared jeeps/private taxis cost ₹400/5000.
Kedarnath
%01364 / Elev 3584m
In the epic Mahabharata, after the Pandavas defeated the Dhartarashtras, they sought forgiveness for killing their own family members, as their enemies also happened to be their cousins. Shiva refused, but the Pandavas were relentless in their quest for absolution, so Shiva, in the form of a bull, dove into the ground to elude them. He left his hump behind at Kedarnath , below the source of the sacred Mandakini River, where a magnificent stone temple – built in the 8th century by Guru Shankara – marks the spot. (Other portions of Shiva’s bull-form body are worshipped at the other four Panch Kedar shrines, which take some effort to reach but can be visited: the arms at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the navel at Madmaheshwar and the hair at Kalpeshwar.) Tucked at the base of 6970m peaks, 22km from the nearest road, Kedarnath is in the most dramatic location of any of the char dham temples. The puja offered inside, especially around the stone 'hump', is fervent and can be quite intense. The site is so auspicious that pilgrims used to throw themselves from one of the cliffs behind the temple in the hope of instantly attaining moksha (liberation).
Kedarnath was at the epicentre of the devastating flood of 2013. Thousands of people – pilgrims and locals, porters and horse guides, among others – perished h      M   h  f th    ill               d th  t      l         d   t       d b  th       i         there. Much of the village around the temple was destroyed by the raging waters and the huge rocks that washed down from the surrounding slopes. Today, nearly as much reverence is paid to a massive boulder that sits behind the temple – which, incredibly, shielded it from the worst of the onslaught and saved it from collapse – as to the temple itself.
The disaster has significantly altered the experience of visiting Kedarnath, as long swaths of the original trail slid off the mountainside, the base village of Gaurikund was ravaged and the road to it was heavily damaged. At the time of research, the pilgrims' route begins at Sonprayag, from where it is a 22km uphill hike to the temple; six to eight hours by foot or five hours if you hire a pony
(₹1800). In Sonprayag, before heading up the trail, you must get a free
'biometric' ID card, then go next door to get your blood pressure tested (we're not sure why…). You then must go a couple doors down to register with the police.
The new route first follows the old road to Gaurikund. Beyond that, the government has set up canteens about every 5km along the trail, where free food and chai are served. If you stay overnight at Kedarnath, the best – and virtually only – place is the GMVN camp, set up about a kilometre before the temple; food and lodging (in a group tent with thin foam pads covering the floor) are free, and GMVN has sleeping bags so there's no imperative to carry your own (though we have no idea how often theirs are cleaned…). If you want to take photos of the sadhus at the temple, bring a pocketful of ₹10 notes.
Reaching Kedarnath by helicopter (₹7200) is becoming an increasingly popular option for Indians, though it doesn't offer the same experience as trekking. Passengers are only able to stay at Kedarnath for about an hour. Advance reservations are recommended. Contact Himalayan Heli Services
(%7895479452; www.himalayanheli.com; Guptkashi-Sonprayag Rd), or go to their office at the
heli pad in Sersi, 20km from Guptkashi.
In Sonprayag, basic accommodation is available for ₹200 to ₹400. A handful of better places can be found about 2km before the trailhead, at Sitapur. If you prefer to stay at Guptkashi, the main transit hub, the New Viswanath
(%9720895992; Guptkashi Bus Stand; r from ₹500), at the bus stand, is a good choice; rooms on the 'back side' are quiet and share a terrace with valley views.
To get to Sonprayag, take a shared/private jeep (₹80/1000) from Guptkashi,or a GMOU bus from Rishikesh or Haridwar. From Sonprayag, morning buses run to Rishikesh (₹340, seven hours), Haridwar (₹340, eight hours), Dehradun (₹340, nine hours) and Badrinath (₹340) or take a share/private jeep back to Guptkashi and travel onwards from there.
Badrinath & Mana Village
%01381 / Elev 3133m
Basking in a superb setting in the shadow of snow-topped Nilkantha, Badrinath Temple appears almost lost in the tatty village that surrounds it. Sacred to Lord Vishnu, this vividly painted temple is the most easily accessible and popular of the char dham temples. It was founded by Guru Shankara in the 8th century, but the current structure is much more recent. Below the temple are hot springs that reach a scalding 40°C and serve as a laundry for locals.
A scenic 3km walk beyond Badrinath along the Alaknanda River (cross over to the temple side to pick up the path), past fields divided by dry-stone walls, leads to tiny but charismatic Mana Village (you can also take a taxi there for
₹200). The village is crammed with narrow stone laneways and traditional houses of varying designs – some have slate walls and roofs while others are wooden with cute balconies. You can wander around and watch the village ladies knitting colourful jerseys or hauling loads of fodder while the men tend goats or play cards or carom billiards. Carpets, blankets, jerseys, hats and gloves are all on sale.
Just outside the village in a small cave is the tiny, 5000-year-old Vyas Temple. Nearby is Bhima’s Rock, a natural rock arch over a river that is said to have been made by Bhima, strongest of the Pandava brothers, whose tale is told in the Mahabharata. The 5km hike along the Alaknanda to the 145m Vasudhara Waterfall has a great reward-to-effort ratio, with views up the valley of the Badrinath massif jutting skywards like a giant fang. The villagers migrate to somewhere warmer and less remote – usually Joshimath – between November and April.
Badrinath can easily be visited in a day from Joshimath if you get an early start, but it’s worth staying if you also want to see Mana Village and do anyhiking. There is a slew of mediocre budget guesthouses lining the main road into town, charging ₹400 to ₹600 per room; they can be loud with pilgrims. Offering among the best value in town are Himgiri Guest House (%7579257765; Badrinath
Village; r ₹500), Narayan Palace Hotel (%9426358998; www.narayanpalace.com; Badrinath Village; ₹3600-4500), and Hotel Snow Crest (%9412082465; www.snowcrest.co.in; Badrinath
Village; r ₹4850-6450) – which is Badrinath's most expensive, but has heaters in the rooms. Even in summer, it can be quite cold here.
From the large bus station at the entrance to Badrinath, GMOU buses run to Haridwar (₹350) via Rishikesh (₹320) at 5.30am and Gaurikund (for Kedarnath, ₹255) at 7am, but check scheduled departure times or you may end up stranded. Private buses to Joshimath and beyond leave sporadically throughout the morning. For Joshimath or Govindghat (for Valley of Flowers) try to take a shared jeep around 7am.
GRAB A WINDOW!
If travelling through the hills or mountains, get to buses early to claim a window seat. The landscape, much of which you’ll never stop to explore, is gorgeous.
UTTARKASHI
%01374 / Pop 17,120 / Elev 1158m
Uttarkashi, 155km from Rishikesh and the largest town in northern Garhwal, is a major stop on the road to Gangotri Temple and the Gaumukh Glacier trek. The main bazaar is worth a wander and has all the supplies you might need. A number of outfitters can arrange treks in the region, including to Tapovan (beyond Gangotri/Gaumukh).
There’s a State Bank of India ATM in the market.
The town is probably best known for the Nehru Institute of
Mountaineering (%01374-222123; www.nimindia.net; h10am-5pm), which trains many
of the guides running trekking and mountaineering outfits in India. The centre is across the river from the main market and has a museum and outdoor climbing wall. Basic and advanced mountaineering and adventure courses are open to all– check the website for details and admission information. Uttarkashi also hosts the annual Makar Sankranti (hJan) festival in
January.

One of the best value choices if you have to catch an early morning bus. It has good beds, hot showers and TVs, and the manager GS Bhandari is superhelpful. It also has one of the better restaurants in town.
8 Getting There & Away At the time of research, regular bus services to Gangotri had ceased, but may begin again after road improvements are made. To get there, take a shared/private taxi (₹200/3000, five hours). Buses head to Rishikesh (₹230, seven hours) every half-hour between 6.30am and 2pm. Five daily buses go to Haridwar (₹260, eight hours) and three go to Dehradun (₹260, nine hours). Buses to Srinagar (₹190, eight hours) leave at 5.30am and 8am, and those to Barkot (₹110, five hours) leave regularly until 3pm. In summer, two morning buses run directly to Janki Chatti (₹170, nine hours) for Yamunotri temple. Seats may sell out on some routes, so it's a good idea to buy tickets a day in advance.TREKKING THE HIMALAYA
There are many sublime trekking routes in Uttarakhand. Here are details on a few, listed from west to east. For more information or more options, pick up Lonely Planet's Trekking in the Indian Himalaya or contact GMVN in Dehradun or local trekking outfitters.
HAR-KI-DUN VALLEY TREK
The wonderfully remote Har-ki-Dun Valley (3510m), within Govind Wildlife Sanctuary & National Park (Indian/foreigner up to 3 days ₹150/600, subsequent days ₹50/250), is a botanical paradise criss-crossed by glacial streams, surrounded by pristine forests and snowy peaks. You might be lucky enough to glimpse the elusive snow leopard above 3500m.
The three-day, 38km trail to Har-Ki-Dun begins at Sankri (also called Saur), where the best place to stay is the new Wild Orchid Inn (%9411500044; www.wildorchidin@gmail.com; Sankri; s/d ₹600/800). There are very basic GMVN Tourist Bungalows at Sankri and along the way in the villages of Taluka and Osla, but at the valley itself you have to stay in the Forest Department rest house or bring a tent. You can cut a day off the hike by taking a share jeep to Taluka and starting from there. A side trip to Jamdar Glacier takes another day. The trek can be busy during June and October.
A couple of reputable guides work out of Sankri – Chain Singh and Bhagat Singh – who run the Har Ki Dun Protection & Mountaineering Association (%9458909022, 9410134589; www.harkidun.org). In addition to outfitting trips to Har-ki-dun, they can take you to the unique villages of the Rupin and Supin Valleys. They also lead treks from Sankri to the Baspa Valley in Himachal Pradesh and along other beautiful routes. Make arrangements in advance by email if possible – these guys are busy.
To get to Sankri, take a direct bus from Gandhi Chowk in Mussoorie or from Dehra
Dun's Mussoorie Bus Stand – or hop onto a series of buses and shared or private jeeps until you get there.
KUARI PASS TREK
Also known as the Curzon Trail (though Lord Curzon’s party abandoned its attempt on the pass following an attack of wild bees), the trek over the Kuari Pass (3640m) was popular in the Raj era. It’s still one of Uttarakhand’s finest and most accessible treks, affording breathtaking views of the snow-clad peaks around Nanda Devi – India’s highest mountain – while passing through the outer sanctuary of Nanda Devi Sanctuary. The trailhead is at Auli and the 75km trek to Ghat past lakes, waterfalls, forests, meadows and small villages takes five days, though it’s possible to do a shorter version that finishes in Tapovan in three days. A tent, guide, permit and your own food supplies are necessary, all of which can be organised easily in Joshimath.
PINDARI GLACIER TREK
This six-day, 94km trek passes through truly virgin country that’s inhabited by only a fewshepherds. It offers wonderful views of Nanda Kot (6860m) and Nanda Khat (6611m) on the southern rim of Nanda Devi Sanctuary. The 3km-long, 365m-wide Pindari Glacier is at 3353m, so take it easy to avoid altitude sickness. Permits aren’t needed but bring your passport.
The trek begins and finishes at Loharket (1700m), a village 36km north of Bageshwar. Guides and porters can be organised easily there, or in the preceding village of Song (1400m), or you can organise package treks through companies in Almora. KMVN operates all-inclusive eight-day treks out of Loharket for ₹5100 per person, staying at government rest houses. KMVN dorms (mattresses on the floor for ₹200), basic guesthouses or dhaba huts (₹100 to ₹300) are dotted along the route, and food is available. KMVN tours are best arranged through KVMN Parvat Tours in Nainital.
Buses (₹50, two hours) or share jeeps (₹60, 1½ hours) run between Song and Bageshwar. Private taxis between Bageshwar and Song/Loharket cost ₹1500/2000.
MILAM GLACIER TREK
This challenging eight-day, 118km trek to the massive Milam Glacier (3450m) is reached along an ancient trade route to Tibet that was closed in 1962 following the war between India and China. It passes through magnificent rugged country to the east of Nanda Devi (7816m) and along the sometimes spectacular gorges of the river, Gori Ganga. You can also take a popular but tough side trip to Nanda Devi East base camp, adding another
32km or three days.
Free permits (passport required) are available from the District Magistrate in Munsyari. You will also need a tent and your own food supplies, as villages on the route may be deserted. KMVN organises all-inclusive eight-day treks (from ₹6325). These are best arranged at KMVN Parvat Tours in Nainital but the KMVN Rest House (%05961-222339; Munsyari) in Munsyari should be able to set you up too.
The base for this excursion is the spectacularly located village of Munsyari, where a guide, cook and porters can be hired and package treks can be arranged through Nanda Devi Tour N Trek (%05961-222324; trek_beeru@rediffmail.com) or Johar Tour & Treks (%05961-222752).
Less travelled but equally (or more) stunning treks include the Begini/Dunagiri route north of Joshimath and the Panchachuli East/Chota Kailash route, north of Dharchula.
JOSHIMATH
%01389 Pop 13,860 Elev 1875m
As the gateway to Badrinath Temple and Hem Kund, Joshimath sees a steady stream of Hindu and Sikh pilgrims from May to October. And as the base for the Valley of Flowers and Kuari Pass treks, and Auli ski resort, it attracts adventure travellers year-round.Reached from Rishikesh by a serpentine mountain road, Joshimath is a ramshackle two-street town with erratic power supply and limited places to eat. Although the mountain views are lost from the town itself, it’s only a short cable car (return ₹500; hevery 20min 8am-6.50pm) ride from here to Auli, which has magnificent vistas of Nanda Devi.
2 Activities To trek the Kuari Pass and other routes in Nanda Devi Sanctuary, you need a permit and a registered guide. There are three excellent operators in town who can organise everything.
Himalayan Snow Runner
(%9756813236, 9412082247; www.himalayansnowrunner.com)
OUTDOOR ADVENTURE

OUTDOOR ADVENTURE
Offers treks and rock-climbing expeditions from about ₹3000 per day, equipment rental (for trekking and skiing), and white-water rafting trips on the Ganges.4 Sleeping & Eating There are lots of cheap lodgings and a few pricier hotels scattered around town.
Joshimath’s trekking outfits also operate upmarket homestay-style guesthouses that are worth considering.
Several dhabas in the main bazaar serve similar vegetarian thalis and dosas from ₹30 to ₹100.
Hotel New Kamal

Aim for the annex in the back, with newer rooms that are worth a few more rupees – but look at a few if you can, as each has unique flaws.
Malari Inn
(%01389-222257; www.hotel-malari-inn.weebly.com; Main Market; r ₹1800-3500)
HOTEL
HOTEL
This is the best place in Joshimath. Standard rooms are basic but spacious and clean; you pay more for more amenities, a fatter mattress and a balcony with valley views. All rooms have geysers. Discounts are offered outside peak season (May through to September).
Auli D's Food Plaza
(Main Market; mains ₹70-450; h7am-10pm)
MULTICUISINE
Featuring a full menu of Indian, Chinese and Continental food, including veg and nonveg choices, this 1st-floor restaurant has plastic tablecloths and covered seats, and feels like a banquet hall.
8 Information There’s a GMVN Tourist Office (%01389-222181; h10am-5pm Mon-Sat) located just north of the town (follow the Tourist Rest House sign off Upper Bazaar Rd), and there’s a State Bank of India ATM. Tour companies have internet services.
8 Getting There & Away Although the main road up to Joshimath is maintained by the Indian army, and a hydroelectric plant on the way to Badrinath has improved that road, the area around Joshimath is inevitably prone to landslides, particularly in the rainy season from mid-June to mid-September.
The best way to get to Badrinath/Govindghat (for Valley of Flowers and Hem Kund) is by shared jeep (₹100/50), leaving from the Badrinath taxi stand at the far end of Upper Bazaar Rd. Hiring the whole jeep costs ₹1400. A few buses (₹65) leave throughout the day from the same place.
Buses run from Joshimath to Rishikesh (₹360, 10 hours) and Haridwar (₹395, 11½ hours), at 4am, 4.30am, 6am and 7am, departing from the tiny GMOU booth (Upper Bazaar Rd; h4am-8pm), where you can also book tickets. From the main jeep stand, private buses leave occasionally for Chamoli (₹75, two hours) and Karanprayag (₹130, four hours), with some continuing to Rishikesh.
To get to the eastern Kumaon region, take any bus or shared taxi to Chamoli then transfer onward to Karanprayag, from where a series of local buses and share jeeps can take you along the beautiful road towards Kausani, Bageshwar and Almora. You may have to change several times along the way. Transport winds down in late afternoon, so get an early start.
AROUND JOSHIMATH
Auli
%01389 / Elev 3048m
Rising above Joshimath, 14km by road – and only 4km by the gondola-style cable car – Auli is India’s premier ski resort. But you don’t have to visit in winter to enjoy the awesome views of Nanda Devi (India’s second-highest peak) from the top of the cable-car stationfrom the top of the cable-car station.
As a ski resort, Auli is hardly spectacular, with gentle 5km-long slopes, one 500m rope tow (₹100 per trip) that runs beside the main slope, and an 800m chairlift (₹200) that connects the upper and lower slopes. The snow is consistently good, though, and the setting is superb. The season runs from January to March, and equipment hire and instruction can be arranged here or in Joshimath.
The state-of-the-art cable car, India’s longest, links Joshimath to the upper slopes above Auli. There’s a cafe, of sorts, at the top, serving hot chai and tomato soup.
The Clifftop Club (%7417936606; www.clifftopclubauli.com; Auli; studio ₹11,600, ste ₹16,250)
wouldn’t look out of place in the Swiss Alps, with its solid timber interior finish, cosy atmosphere and spacious rooms, some with views of Nanda Devi. Meals and all-inclusive ski packages, including equipment, are available.
If on a tighter budget, stay at the surprisingly good GMVN Tourist Rest
House (%01389-223208; www.gmvnl.com; dm ₹280, r ₹1650-4400, incl breakfast) at the start of
the chairlift. There's also the unique Devi Darshan (%9719316777;
www.mountainshepherds.com; r from ₹3650 incl meals), which has a restaurant and common
room with full-on Nanda Devi views, though bedrooms are dark.
VALLEY OF FLOWERS & HEM KUND
British mountaineer Frank Smythe stumbled upon the Valley of Flowers in 1931. ‘In all my mountain wandering,’ he wrote, ‘I have not seen a more beautiful valley where the human spirit may find repose'. The bugyals (high-altitude meadows) of tall wildflowers are a glorious sight on a sunny day, rippling in the breeze, and framed by mighty 6000m mountains that have glaciers and snow decorating their peaks all year.
The 300 species of flowers make this World Heritage Site a unique and valuable pharmaceutical resource. Unfortunately, most flowers bloom during the monsoon season in July and August, when the rains make access difficult and hazardous. There’s a widespread misconception that the valley isn’t worth visiting outside peak flower season, but even without its technicolour carpet it’s still ridiculously beautiful. And it's more likely to be sunny.To reach the 87-sq-km Valley of Flowers National Park (Indian/foreigner up to
3 days ₹40/600, subsequent days ₹20/175; h7am-5pm Jun-Oct, last entry 2pm) first requires a
full-day hike from Govindghat to the village of Ghangaria (also called Govinddham), less than 1km from the park. The fabled valley begins 2km uphill from the ticket office and continues for another 5km. Tracks are easy to follow.
A tougher hike from Ghangaria involves joining the hundreds of Sikh pilgrims toiling up to the 4300m Hem Kund, the sacred lake surrounded by seven peaks where Sikh guru Gobind Singh is believed to have meditated in a previous life. Ponies (₹400) are available if you prefer to ride up the 6km zigzag trail.
The trek to Ghangaria is a scenic but strenuous 14km uphill from Govindghat, which takes five to seven hours. You can quicken the trip and help the local economy by hiring a pony (₹610) through the Eco Development Committee office at the bridge over the Alaknanda River. The return trip takes four to five hours. You don’t need to carry food because there are dhabas and drink stalls along the way serving the army of pilgrims heading to Hem Kund. Top tip: if you have the time, sleep at Badrinath the night before you trek to Ghangaria to acclimatise your body to the altitude; it'll make the hike easier.
Overnight stays are not permitted in the Valley of Flowers or at Hem Kund so you must stay in Ghangaria, a one-street village in a wonderful deodar forest with a busy market, a handful of budget hotels and mediocre restaurants, hundreds of ponies, a pharmacy and a doctor. Water and electricity supplies are erratic. It can get cold, so bring warm layers. The village shuts down outside the pilgrimage season, which lasts from 1 June to 1 October (or thereabouts).
Hotel Pritam (Ghangaria; s/d ₹300/400) is one of the better budget places to stay. Hotel Priya (Ghangaria; r from ₹250) is good, too. No hotels have heat, but they do have heaps of blankets.
Despite the distances and grades of the trails, treks to Ghangaria, the Valley of Flowers and Hem Kund are often undertaken by small children and people with weak legs or lungs – they ride up in a wicker chair hauled on the back of a kandi (porter; from ₹500) or reclining in a dandi (litter; from ₹5500), carried on the shoulders of four men like the royalty of old. It's also possible to fly by Deccan Air (%9412051036; www.deccanair.com) helicopter from Govindghat to Gangharia (one way/return ₹3500/7000); the booking office is at the top of the road leadingdown to the village.
At Govindghat, there are lots of lodging options for around ₹200, as well as the huge gurdwara (payment by donation), where VIP rooms are basic. The
Hotel Bhagat (%9412936360; www.hotelbhagat.com; Badrinath Rd; r ₹1625-3000), up on the
main road between Joshimath and Badrinath, has very clean rooms with river views, geysers and meals.
All buses and share jeeps between Joshimath and Badrinath stop in Govindghat, so you can easily find transport travelling in either direction, though this trickles off later in the day and stops dead at night.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
TUNGNATH & CHANDRISILLA
One of the best day hikes in Uttarakhand, the trail to Tungnath Mandir (3680m) and Chandrisilla Peak (4000m) features a sacred Panch Kedar temple and a stunning Himalayan panorama.
The trail starts at Chopta, a small village with no electricity, which is found on the winding road between Chamoli (south of Joshimath) and Kund (south of Gaurikund). A well-paved path switchbacks 3.5km uphill, gaining 750m in elevation, to Tungnath, the highest Shiva temple in the world. A dirt trail continues 1.5km further to the top of Chandrisilla. From the summit, the Garhwali and Kumaoni Himalayas stretch out before you, with awesome vistas of major mountains including Nanda Devi, Trishul and the Kedarnath group. Start early before the clouds move in, or head up in the afternoon, stay at one of the spartan guesthouses around Tungnath and hit Chandrisilla for sunrise. There's basic accommodation in Chopta: Hotel Neelkanth (%7500139051, 7351442200; r from ₹400) has the best rooms, but Hotel Rajkamal (r ₹200) is the friendliest.
The drive from Chamoli to Chopta is a worthwhile diversion in itself, as it traverses steeply terraced hillsides dotted with rural villages before entering a lushly forested musk-deer sanctuary pierced by dramatic cliffs.
CORBETT TIGER RESERVE
%05947 / Elev 400-1210m
The famous Corbett Tiger Reserve (www.corbettnationalpark.in; h15 Nov–15 Jun, Jhirna
zone open year-round) was established in 1936 as India’s first national park, and now includes surrounding forest lands. It’s named for legendary British hunter JimCorbett (1875–1955), who put Kumaon on the map with his book The Man- Eaters of Kumaon. Greatly revered by local people for killing tigers that preyed on people, Corbett eventually shot more wildlife with his camera than with his gun and became a prominent voice for conservation.
Tiger sightings take some luck, as the 220 or so tigers in the reserve are neither baited nor tracked. Your best chance of spotting one is late in the season (April to mid-June), when the forest cover is low and animals come out in search of water.
Notwithstanding tiger sightings, few serious wildlife enthusiasts will leave disappointed, as the 1318-sq-km park has a variety of wildlife and birdlife in grassland, sal forest and river habitats, and a beautiful location in the foothills of the Himalaya on the river, Ramganga. Commonly seen wildlife include wild elephants (200 to 300 live in the reserve), sloth bears, langur monkeys, rhesus macaques, peacocks, romps of otters and several types of deer including chital (spotted deer), sambars, hog deer and barking deer. You might also see leopards, mugger crocodiles, gharials, monitor lizards, wild boars and jackals. The Ramganga Reservoir attracts large numbers of migrating birds, especially from mid-December to the end of March, and more than 600 species have been spotted here.
Of Corbett’s six zones – Bijrani, Dhikala, Dhela, Durga Devi, Jhirna and Sonanadi – Dhikala is the highlight of the park, 49km northwest of Ramnagar and deep inside the reserve. This is the designated core area, where the highest concentration of the animals you probably hope to see are found. It’s open from 15 November to 15 June and only to overnight guests, or as part of a one-day tour available through the park's reception centre (%05947-251489; Ranikhet Rd; h6am-4pm), opposite Ramnagar's bus stand.
Jhirna and Dhela, in the southern part of the reserve, are the only zones that remains open all year, but your chances of seeing serious megafauna in those areas are iffy – at least for now. Dhela, which opened to the public in December 2014, may eventually include a large fenced section meant to house rescued tigers, which should be fairly easy to spot. There are also plans to create two nature trails in Dhela; we're told that these will mainly be for birdwatching, and that the trails will be protected by fences, so you don't have to worry about becoming tiger prey. At the time of writing, Dhela safaris could only be bookedggpy
g
y
in Ramnagar, not online, but this may change in the future. Note that in some years, depending on conditions, the other four zones may open in October, but the only way to find out is to contact the reception centre.
Be sure to bring binoculars (you can hire them at park gates) and plenty of mosquito repellent and bottled water. If you’re interested in the life of Jim Corbett, his former house at Kaladhungi, 26km southeast of Ramnagar, is now a
museum (Kaladhungi; admission ₹50; h8am-5pm).
T Tours The reception centre in Ramnagar runs daily bus tours (%05947-251489; Ranikhet Rd; Indian/foreigner
₹1125/2250) to Dhikala – called Canter Safaris – at 6am and noon.
Jeeps can be hired at the reception centre in Ramnagar, or through your accommodation or a tour agency. Jeep owners have formed a union, so in theory rates are fixed (on a per-jeep basis, carrying up to six people). Half-day safaris (leaving in the morning and afternoon) should cost ₹1500 to Bijrani, ₹1800 to Jhirna, ₹1800 to Dhela, ₹2200 to Durga Devi, and ₹2200 to Sonanadi – not including the entry fees for you and your guide. Full-day safaris cost double. Overnight excursions to Dhikala cost ₹5200. Check current prices at the reception centre and at your hotel before hiring a jeep. Safaris offered by Karan Singh, who runs Karan's Corbett Motel, are highly recommended.
Two-hour elephant rides (Indian/foreigner ₹300/1000) are available only at Dhikala and Bijrani, at 6am and 4pm on a first-come, first-served basis.
PERMITS
Corbett Tiger Reserve controls tourist impact by limiting the number of vehicles into each zone each day. It's highly recommended that you make advance reservations. You can book via the park's website (www.corbettonline.uk.gov.in) or by signing up for a trip with a safari outfit. If you book online (fee ₹50), give your reservation confirmation to your driver, whether you hire one from the reservation centre or use a tour operator. Day trips can be booked three months in advance; if you can't plan ahead, go to the reception centre and try to pick up a leftover vehicle permit. If they are all gone, you still might be able to visit the park; safari operators will ask each other if anyone is running a jeep withopen seats that you can fill. Overnight trips to Dhikala are best booked by calling the reception centre or a safari company.
For a day trip, the vehicle fee (not including passengers) costs ₹200/500 for Indians/foreigners; for an overnight jaunt, it's ₹500/1500. Then there's the visitor entry fee, which is about the craziest system we've seen in a while. Officially, the single-day fee (valid for four hours, available for every zone except Dikhala) is ₹100/450 per
Indian/foreigner; three-day permits cost ₹200/900. But the park makes you pay visitor fees for every seat in the jeep, even if they are empty. Kindly, they imagine that unoccupied seats are filled by Indians, so two passengers in a jeep will pay their own entry fees, plus ₹100 for the driver's entry, plus an extra ₹400 for their invisible Indian companions!
How much does this all cost? Add up your jeep-hire fee, vehicle entry fee, visitor entry fees, driver's entry fee and empty seat fees, and that's your total. Arranging everything yourself is marginally cheaper than taking a safari or hotel tour, but they provide expert guides fluent in English, which can be well worth the few extra rupees.
4 Sleeping & Eating For serious wildlife viewing, Dhikala – deep inside the reserve – is the prime place to stay, though prices for foreigners are exorbitant. Book through the park's website (www.corbettonline.uk.gov.in) at least one month in advance. The town of Ramnagar has budget accommodation, while upmarket resorts are strung out along the road skirting the eastern side of the park between Dhikuli and Dhangarhi Gate.
Dhikala
Easily the cheapest beds in the park are at Log Huts (%9212777223, 05947-251489; dm Indian/foreigner ₹200/400), resembling 3AC train sleepers, with 24 basic beds (no
bedding supplied). Tourist Hutments (%9212777223, 05947-251489; Indian/foreigner
₹1250/2500) offer the best value accommodation in Dhikala and sleep up to six people. Book via www.dhikalaforestlodge.in or www.corbettonline.uk.gov.in. Dhikala has a couple of restaurants serving vegetarian food. No alcohol is allowed in the park.
Accommodation at the New Forest Rest House (%9212777223, 05947-251489; rIndian/foreigner ₹1250/2500), Annexe (%05947-251489, 9212777223; r Indian/foreigner

Rest House (r Indian/foreigner ₹1500/3000 or ₹2500/5000) can all be booked at the
reception centre in Ramnagar.

A growing number of upmarket African-style safari resorts are strung along the Ramnagar–Ranikhet road that runs along the reserve’s eastern boundary. Most are around a settlement called Dhikuli – not to be confused with Dhikala. When most of the reserve is closed (15 June to 15 November), discounts of up to 50% are offered. Most rates are for a room only, but most have packages that include meals and safaris. All places have resident naturalists, recreational facilities, restaurants and bars.

The already-upscale resort was purchased by the Taj Group and is getting a makeover. We're told they're incorporating many of the green technologies that they've used around other national parks. Rooms are luxury cottages, spread among a lush garden. There's a poolside bar and a relaxing riverside terrace. Prices will probably rise before you read this.

It occupies a steep forested valley around the namesake lake Naini and was founded by homesick Brits reminded of the Cumbrian Lake District.
Plenty of hotels are set in the forested hills around the lake. There’s a busy bazaar and a spider’s web of walking tracks covers the forested hillsides to viewpoints overlooking the distant Himalayan peaks. For travellers, it’s an easy place to kick back and relax, eat well, and go horse riding or paddling on the lake. In peak seasons – roughly May to mid-July and October – Nainital is packed to the gills with holidaying families and honeymooners, and hotel prices skyrocket.
Tallital (Lake’s Foot) is at the southeastern end of the lake where you’ll find the bus stand and the main road heading east towards Bhowali. The 1.5km promenade known as the Mall leads to Mallital (Lake’s Head) at the northwestern end of the lake. Most hotels, guest houses and restaurants are strung out along the Mall between Mallital and Tallital. You'll most find shops, including pharmacies, in Bara Bazaar.Nainital

ALMORA
%05962 Pop 33,000 Elev 1650m
Clinging to a steep-sided valley, Almora is the regional capital of Kumaon, first established as a summer capital by the Chand rajas of Kumaon in 1560. These days you'll find some colonial-era buildings, reliable trekking outfits and a couple of community-based weaving enterprises. Don’t be put off by the ugly, shambolic main street when you’re first deposited at the bus stand – head one block south to the pedestrian-only cobbled Lalal Bazaar, lined with intricately carved and painted traditional wooden shop facades. It’s a fascinating place to stroll, people-watch and shop.

AROUND ALMORA
Kasar Devi
This peaceful spot about 8km north of Almora has been luring alternative types for close to 100 years – as a result, it's also known as Crank's Ridge. The list of luminaries who've visited, some for extended stays, includes Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens, Timothy Leary, Allen Ginsburg and Swami Vivekananda, who meditated at the hilltop Kasar Devi Temple. Today, the village is a low-key backpacker destination, with a mellow vibe and clear-day Himalayan views. There's not a lot to do here, but it's a great place to chill. And Mohan's BinsarRetreat can arrange multiday fishing, rafting, or trekking trips. Get there from Almora by share jeep (₹20) or private taxi (₹250).
4 Sleeping & Eating There are some great budget to midrange guesthouses here, along with a few restaurants and shops.
Freedom Guest House

GUESTHOUSE
Big, immaculately clean rooms open onto shared terraces with west-facing valley views, catching the afternoon and sunset light. New rooms on the upper floors have a bit more luxury. If you ask nicely and pay for gas, Gita, the owner, may set you up with your own little kitchen.

Arguably the nicest place in Kasar Devi, Mohan's has huge, beautiful rooms with luxurious beds and wooden ceilings and floors. The real draw is the indoor- outdoor terrace restaurant, with great views of the valley below and a shot of distant Himalayan peaks. There's an internet cafe and a library.Rainbow Restaurant
(%9720320664; www.kasarrainbowresort.com; Binsar Rd; ₹100-200; h9am-9.30pm)
INTERNATIONAL
Currently Kasar Devi's main backpacker hang-out, sit at tables or cushions on the floor while ordering Indian, Asian, Western or Middle Eastern food. Everything we tried was delicious – especially dessert. The owners also run a top-notch guesthouse with rooms from ₹2100 to ₹5000.
Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary
Beyond Kasar Devi, picturesque Binsar, 26km from Almora, was once the hilltop summer capital of the Chand rajas. Now it's a sanctuary protecting 45 sq km. You may spot a leopard or some barking deer, but many people come here for the 200-plus species of birds. On clear days, the Himalayan panorama is breathtaking – from the tower at 'Zero Point,' Binsar's summit (2420m), you can see Kedarnath, Nanda Devi, Panchachuli and more. Hiking trails wend throughout the lush forest; their main nexus is the KMVN Rest House. There is one good map of Binsar put out by the Forest Department, with trails and topo lines, but this is very hard to find; it's not offered at the entry gate.
It's possible to trek between the villages that are in the sanctuary, sleeping in rural homestays (which vary in quality and price). For details, call guides Pooja at 9759749283 or Nandan at 9411516469 (be sure to compare details and
prices).
The fee to enter the sanctuary is ₹150/600 per Indian/foreigner, plus a ₹250 to ₹500 vehicle fee depending on what you're driving. Guides, who can be hired at the sanctuary gate or the Rest House, charge ₹250 for a 1½-hour hike. A return taxi from Almora costs about ₹1100.
Jageshwar
An impressive and active temple complex is set along a creek in a forest of deodars at the village of Jageshwar, 38km northeast of Almora. The 124 temples and shrines date to the 7th century AD and vary from linga shrines to largesikhara (Hindu temples) dedicated to different gods and goddesses. Down the street is the Jageshwar Archaeological Museum (www.asi.nic.in; Jageshwar; h10am-5pm Sat-Thu), which houses a small collection of exquisite religious carvings taken from the temples for preservation purposes. It is well worth a look; among the highlights are the 'Dancing Ganesha' and the highly detailed version of 'Uma/Maheshwar Sitting on Nandi' with the intense snake action.
A 3km trail that starts below the centre of the village leads to the top of the ridge behind it. The ridge has dizzying views of the sculpted valley on the other side and the big peaks in the distance.
There are a number of dhabas in Jageshwar, plus a handful of hotels. The best
of the bunch is Tara Guest House (%9411544736; www.jageshwar.co.uk; Jageshwar; r
from ₹200; W), surrounded by gardens, with views of the forest and the temple. It has basic but decent rooms. The easiest way to get from Almora to Jageshwar is by taxi (₹1200 return) or shared taxi (₹75). There's one direct bus daily around noon. It returns to Almora at 8am the following day. You can also take any bus going through Artola, get off there, and either walk 4km to Jageshwar or take a taxi for ₹80.
BORDER CROSSING – INTO NEPAL FROM BANBASSA
Banbassa is the closest Indian village to the Nepal border post of Mahendranagar, 5km away. Check the current situation in western Nepal before crossing here, as roads during monsoon or immediate postmonsoon season may be impassable due to landslides and washed-out bridges. Buses run between Banbassa and Delhi, Haldwani, Haridwar and Pithoragarh.
BORDER HOURS
The border is open 24 hours, but before 6am and after 6pm you’re unlikely to find anyone to stamp you in and out of the respective countries. While officially open to vehicles only from 6am to 8am, 10am to noon, 2pm to 4pm and 6pm to 7pm, rickshaws and motorcycles are usually allowed to make the 1km trip across the bridge between the border posts at any time. Otherwise, you have to walk it.

KAUSANI

Perched high on a forest-covered ridge, this tiny village has lovely panoramic views of distant snowcapped peaks, fresh air and a relaxed atmosphere. Mahatma Gandhi found Kausani an inspirational place to write his Bhagavad Gita treatise Anasakti Yoga in 1929, and there is still an ashram devoted to him here. Baijnath village, 19km north, has an intriguing complex of 12th-century sikhara-style temples in a lovely location shaded by trees, with other shrines in the nearby old village.

HISTORIC SITE
About 1km uphill from the bus stand, Anasakti Ashram is where Mahatma Gandhi spent two weeks pondering and writing Anasakti Yoga. It has a smallmuseum (Anasakti Ashram Rd; h6am-noon & 4-7pm) that tells the story of Gandhi’s life
through photographs and words. Visit at 6pm to attend nightly prayers in his memory.

8 Getting There & Away Buses and share jeeps stop in the village centre. Several buses run to Almora (₹120, 2½ hours), but in the afternoon they generally stop at Karbala on the bypass road, from where you need to take a share jeep (₹10). Heading north, buses run every hour or so to Bageshwar via Baijnath (₹55, 1½ hours). Share jeeps (₹25, 30 minutes) run to Garur, 16km north of Kausani, which is a much more active transport hub, and where you can find share jeeps to Gwaldam for onward buses and jeeps to Garhwal (via Karanprayag). A taxi to Almora costs around ₹1200; to Nainital or Karanprayag it costs ₹3000.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
MUNSYARI
Perched on a mountainside surrounded by plunging terraced fields, where the 6000m Panchachuli peaks scrape the sky across the Johar Valley, Munsyari (2290m) is one of the most scenic villages in Uttarakhand. Visited mostly by trekkers heading to the Milam Glacier, the surrounding landscape makes this a worthwhile destination even if you don't plan on lacing up your boots and hitting the trail.
There are some nice day hikes in the area. Two kilometres downhill from the bazaar, the small Tribal Heritage Museum (%9411337094; admission ₹10), run by the charming scholar SS Pangtey, has artefacts from the days when Munsyari was an important nexus of trade with Tibet. This is also a unique place to experience the Nanda Devi Festival in September.
The Hotel Pandey Lodge (%9411130316; www.munsyarihotel.com; near the bus stand; r ₹200- 1850), by the bus stand, has a wide range of good-value rooms, some with amazing views, and an extremely helpful owner. Munsyari's dining situation is sparse. If you want to eat until you’re stuffed (plates refilled free), try the hole-in-the-wall dhaba (₹40) just to the left of the big 'Nanda Devi Trek n Tour' sign, at the main chowk.
Buses run to and from Bageshwar (₹150, six hours) and Almora (₹200, 11 hours). Share jeeps run to Pithoragarh (₹180, eight hours) and Thal (₹120, three hours), where

If travelling to Munsyari via Thal, get a right-side window seat for the best views along the road. If you came from Thal and are heading to Pithoragarh, consider taking the longer route via Jauljibi for a change of scenery, including some amazing vistas of the Kumaon and Nepali Himalayas.
BAGESHWAR
%05963 Pop 8000 Elev 975m
Hindu pilgrims visit Bageshwar, at the confluence of the Gomti and Sarju Rivers, for its ancient stone Bagnath Temple. For travellers, it’s more important as a transit town to or from the Milam or Pindari Glacier trailheads. There are a couple of internet cafes around, and there’s a State Bank of India ATM in the main bazaar.
The OK Hotel Annapurna (%05963-220109; r ₹200-400, s/d without bathroom
₹70/150) is conveniently located next to the bus stand, but for something much better, head for Hotel Narendra Palace (%9319083181; www.hotelnarendrapalace.in; Pindari Rd; ₹350-1500; a), about 1km from the bus stand on Pindari Rd.
Several daily buses go to Almora (₹115, three hours), and Ranikhet (₹115, three hours) via Kausani (₹45, 1½ hours). Frequent buses run to Bhowali (₹175, six hours) and Haldwani (₹225, 7½ hours). For connections to Garhwal, take a bus to Gwaldam (₹60, two hours) and change there. There are several morning buses to Pithoragarh (₹160, seven hours) and one at 9am to Munsyari (₹150, six hours). There's a jeep stand near the bus stand, along with a few other spots around town. Share jeeps go to Garur (₹35, 45 minutes), Kausani (₹55, 1½ hours) and Gwaldam (₹85, two hours). A shared/private jeep costs ₹90/1500 to Song (two hours), ₹110/2000 to Loharket (2½ hours), ₹400/5000 to Munsyari (five hours), ₹350/4000 to Pithoragarh (six hours) and ₹150/1500 to Almora (two hours).
PITHORAGARH
%05964 Pop 42,000 Elev 1514m
Spread across the hillsides above a scenic valley that’s been dubbed ‘Little Kashmir', Pithoragarh is the main town of a little-visited region that bordersTibet and Nepal. Its sights include several Chand-era temples and an old fort, but the real reason to come here is to get off the tourist trail. The busy main bazaar is good for a stroll, and townspeople are exceptionally friendly. Picturesque hikes in the area include the rewarding climb up to Chandak (7km) for views of the Panchachuli (Five Chimneys) massif.
The tourist office (%05964-225527), located 50m uphill from the jeep stand, can help with trekking guides and information; a State Bank of India ATM and a few internet cafes (₹30 per hour) are in the bazaar. Cheap hotels can be found around the bus stand (rooms from ₹300), but for something much better head 200m uphill to Hotel Yash Yatharth (%05964-225005; www.punethahotels.com; Naya Bazaar; dm ₹200, r ₹1000-3400); rates can be halved if business is slow. For a good meal at a good price, locals swear by Jyonar Restaurant (Gandhi Chowk; mains ₹80-
250; h8am-10pm) in the bazaar.
Several buses leave in the morning for Almora (₹160, five hours). Frequent buses go to Delhi; there are hourly services from 5am to 2pm to Banbassa (₹255, six hours), the border crossing into Nepal; and buses to Haldwani (10 hours) depart at 5am, 6.30am and 9.30am. To get to Munsyari, take a share jeep (₹250, seven hours).Kolkata (Calcutta)

Kolkata (Calcutta)
%033 / Pop 14.1 million
Why Go?
India’s second-biggest city is a daily festival of human existence, simultaneously noble and squalid, cultured and desperate. By its old spelling, Calcutta conjures up images of human suffering to most Westerners. But locally, Kolkata isregarded as India’s intellectual and cultural capital. While poverty is certainly in your face, the dapper Bengali gentry continue to frequent grand old gentlemen’s clubs, back horses at the Calcutta Racetrack and tee off at some of India’s finest golf courses.
As the former capital of British India, Kolkata retains a feast of colonial-era architecture contrasting starkly with urban slums and dynamic new-town suburbs with their air-conditioned shopping malls. Kolkata is the ideal place to experience the mild, fruity tang of Bengali cuisine. Friendlier than India’s other metropolises, this is a city you ‘feel’ more than simply visit. Walk the chaotic back alleys, ride the Hooghly ferries and, if you’ve got more time, take an excursion to the Sundarbans.
When to Go
A Sep & Oct The city dresses up magnificently for the colourful mayhem of Durga Puja.
A Nov–Jan Cool and dry; there’s a big film-fest in November and a music festival in January.
A May–Sep Best avoided unless you’re prepared for a very serious drenching.

History Although for centuries Kalikata (now Kalighat) had been home to a much-revered temple, the Kolkata area was very much a rural backwater when British merchant Job Charnock showed up in 1686. He considered the site appropriate for a new, defendable colonial settlement and within a few decades a miniature version of London was sprouting stately buildings and English churches amid wide boulevards and grand formal gardens. But the grand illusion vanished abruptly at Calcutta’s frayed edges where Indians servicing the Raj mostly lived in cramped, overcrowded slums.
The most notable hiccup in the city’s meteoric rise came in 1756, when Siraj- ud-daula, the nawab of nearby Murshidabad, recaptured the city. Dozens of members of the colonial aristocracy were imprisoned in a cramped room beneath Fort William. By morning, around 40 of them were dead from suffocation. The British press exaggerated numbers, drumming up moral outrage back home: the legend of the ‘Black Hole of Calcutta’ was born.
The following year, Clive of India retook Calcutta for Britain. The nawab sought aid from the French but was soundly defeated at the Battle of Plassey (now Palashi), thanks mainly to the treachery of former allies. A stronger moated ‘second’ Fort William was constructed in 1758 in octagonal, Vaubanesque form. The whole village of Gobindapur was flattened to give the new fort’s cannons a clear line of fire. Though sad for then-residents, this created the Maidan (moi- dan), a 3km-long park that is today as fundamental to Kolkata as Central Park is to New York City.
Calcutta became British India’s official capital, though well into the late 18th century one could still hunt tigers in the bamboo forests around where Sudder St lies today.
The late-19th-century Bengali Renaissance movement saw a great culturalreawakening among middle-class Calcuttans. This was further galvanised by the massively unpopular 1905 division of Bengal, sowing the seeds of the Indian Independence movement. Bengal was reunited in 1911, but the British promptly transferred their colonial capital to less troublesome Delhi.
Initially, loss of political power had little effect on Calcutta’s economic status. However, the impact of 1947’s partition was devastating. While West Pakistan and Punjab saw a fairly equal (if bloody) exchange of populations, migration in Bengal was almost entirely one way. Around four million Hindu refugees from East Bengal arrived, choking Calcutta’s already overpopulated bastis (slums). For a period, people really were dying of hunger in the streets, creating Calcutta’s abiding image of abject poverty. No sooner had these refugees been absorbed than a second wave arrived during the 1971 India–Pakistan War.
After India’s partition, the port of Calcutta was hit very hard by the loss of its main natural hinterland, now behind the closed Pakistan (later Bangladesh) border. Labour unrest spiralled out of control while the city’s dominant party (Communist Party of India) spent most of its efforts attacking the feudal system of land ownership. Well-intentioned attempts to set strict rent controls backfired: where tenants pay only a few rupees in monthly rent, landlords have no interest in maintaining or upgrading properties, so many fine old buildings spent years crumbling.
In 2001, Calcutta officially adopted the more phonetic spelling, Kolkata. Around the same time the city administration implemented a new, relatively business-friendly attitude that has encouraged a noticeable economic resurgence. The most visible results are numerous suburban shopping malls and apartment towers plus the rapid emergence of Salt Lake City’s Sector 5 as Kolkata’s alternative corporate and entertainment centre, albeit well off most tourists’ radar.Central Kolkata

The incredible Victoria Memorial is a vast, beautifully proportioned festival of white marble: think US Capitol meets Taj Mahal. Had it been built for a beautiful Indian princess rather than a dead colonial queen, this would surely be considered one of India’s greatest buildings. It was designed to commemorate Queen Victoria’s 1901 diamond jubilee, but construction wasn’t completed until nearly 20 years after her death.
Inside, highlights are the soaring central chamber and the Calcutta Gallery, an excellent, even-handed exhibition tracing the city’s colonial-era history. But even if you don’t want to go in, the building is still worth admiring from afar: there’s a magnificently photogenic view across reflecting ponds from the northeast. Or you can get closer by paying your way into the large, well-tendedpark. Entrance is from the north or south gates (with ticket booths at both). The east gate is exit-only by day, but on dry season evenings, enter here for the 45-

BBD Bagh
One of Raj-era Calcutta’s foremost squares, BBD Bagh is centred on a palm- lined central reservoir-lake (‘tank’) that once supplied the young city’s water. Although concrete intrusions detract from the overall spectacle, many a splendid colonial-era edifice remains. Foremost is the 1780 Writers’ Building (

 ), whose glorious south facade looks something like a French
provincial city hall. It was originally built for clerks (‘writers’) of the East India
Company. Behind, past the joyously re-painted Eastern Railway Building (

 ; NS Rd), the former Chartered Bank Building (

from the untended upper turrets. The 1860s GPO (

soaring rotunda and the Standard Life Building (

KOLKATA IN…
THREE DAYS
On the first day, admire the Victoria Memorial and surrounding attractions, then visit India Tourism to grab a Marble Palace permit (to be used two days hence), before dining and dancing on Park St. On day two wander through the colonial-era wonderland of BBD
Bagh (

 ; Dalhousie Sq), experience the fascinating/disturbing alley-
life of Old Chinatown and Barabazar , and observe Howrah Bridge from colourful Mullik Ghat flower market. Day three visit Marble Palace and surrounding attractions, continuing to Kumartuli directly or by a vastly longer loop via Dakshineswar and Belur Math.
ONE WEEK
In addition to the three-day itinerary, experience the contrasts of Southern Kolkata, its art galleries, golf clubs, dawn laughing clubs, the great Bengali food and the goat sacrifices at Kalighat. Ponder the moral dilemmas of taking/not taking a hand-drawn rickshaw. Then take a multiday tour to the Sundarbans in West Bengal or consider volunteering for a few days having visited Mother Teresa’s Motherhouse.Barabazar & Howrah
The following walk links several minor religious sights but much of the fun comes from exploring the vibrantly chaotic alleys en route that teem with traders, rickshaw couriers and baggage wallahs hauling impossibly huge packages balanced on their heads. Hidden away amid the paper-merchants of
Old China Bazaar St, the Armenian Church of Nazareth (

Howrah Bridge is a 705m-long abstraction of steel cantilevers, sweat and traffic fumes. Built during WWII, it’s one of the world’s busiest bridges and a Kokatan architectural icon. Photography of the bridge is technically prohibited but you might sneak a discreet shot from one of the various ferries that ply the Hooghly River to the vast 1906 Howrah train station.
Mullik Ghat Flower Market
FLOWER MARKET

Near the southeast end of Howrah Bridge, the flower market is fascinatingly colourful virtually 24 hours a day. Many workers live in makeshift shacks, bathing in the river behind from a ghat with sunset views of Howrah Bridge. At around 7am local wrestlers practise their art on a small caged area of sand set just back from the river.
MOTHER TERESA
For many people, Mother Teresa (1910–97) was the living image of human sacrifice. Born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu to Albanian parents in then-Ottoman Üsküp (now Skopje in Macedonia), she joined the Irish Order of Loreto nuns and worked for over a decade teaching in Calcutta’s St Mary’s High School. Horrified by the city’s spiralling poverty, she established a new order, the Missionaries of Charity (www.motherteresa.org) and founded refuges for the destitute and dying. The first of these, Nirmal Hriday, opened in 1952. Although the order swiftly expanded into an international charity, Mother Teresa herself continued to live in absolute simplicity. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 and beatified by the Vatican in October 2003, the first official step towards being made a saint.
But this ‘Saint of the Gutters’ is not universally beloved. For some Kolkatans it’s slightly galling to find their cultured, predominantly Hindu city popularly linked in the world’s mind with a Catholic heroine whose work underlined the city’s least appealing facet. Germaine Greer has accused Mother Teresa of religious imperialism, while Christopher Hitchens’ book, The Missionary Position, decried the donations from dictators and corrupt tycoons. Many have questioned the Missionaries of Charity’s minimal medical background and Teresa’s staunchly Catholic position against contraception. However, the organisation was never primarily focused on saving lives, simply offering a little love and dignity to the dying. Before Mother Teresa, even that was an unknown luxury for the truly destitute.Old Chinatown
For nearly two centuries the area around Phears Lane was Kolkata's Chinatown. A fit of anti-Chinese fervour during the 1962 war drove many ethnic Chinese away and these days ‘old’ Chinatown is predominantly Muslim. However, just after dawn, there’s a lively market scene on Tiretta’s Bazaar. It’s all closed by
10am, as is the archetypal old shop, Hap Hing (

This resplendent 1835 rajah’s mansion is overstuffed with dusty statues of thinkers and dancing girls, much Victoriana, ample Belgian glassware and fine if bedraggled paintings, including supposedly original works by Murillo, Joshua Reynolds and Rubens.
Napoleons beat Wellingtons three to one in the music room, which is lavishly floored with marble inlay. The ballroom retains its vast array of candle chandeliers with globes of silvered glass to spread illumination: original 19th- century disco balls.

To find Marble Palace from MG Rd metro, walk north and turn left at the first traffic light (171 Chittaranjan Ave).

DURGA PUJA
Much as Carnival transforms Rio or New Orleans, Durga Puja brings Kolkata to a fever pitch of colourfully chaotic mayhem as the city’s biggest festival celebrates the maternal essence of the divine. For five days in the Bengali month of Aswin, people venerate gaudily painted idols of the 10-armed goddess Durga and her entourage displayed in pandals (temporary shrines) that dominate yards and block roads. Pandals grow ever more ornate and complex each year, some carrying topical or political messages. West Bengal Tourism tours try to take tourists around a selection of the best pandals, but getting anywhere within the city can take hours given the general festive pandemonium. At the festival’s climax, myriad Durga idols are thrown into the sacred Hooghly River amid singing, water throwing, fireworks and indescribable traffic congestion. If you just want pandal photos and not the festival aspect, consider visiting just after Durga Puja when the idols have gone but pandals have yet to be deconstructed. Or come back for Kali Puja three weeks later when the city does the whole thing all over again, this time with statues of blue-faced, red-tongued Kali.

Countless effigies of deities are immersed in the holy Hooghly during Kolkata’s colourful pujas (offering or prayers). Most have been created in specialist kumar (sculptor) workshops in this enthralling district, notably along Banamali Sakar St, the lane running west from 499 Rabindra Sarani. Craftsmen are busiest from August to October, creating straw frames, adding clay coatings and painting the divine features for the Durga and Kali festivals. In November, old figures washup on river banks and are refurbished.

Picking up next door to Belur Math train station, minibus 11 and buses 54/56 run to Esplanade/Howrah in miserable stop-start traffic. Southbound they pass almost beside Bandaghat from which you might prefer to take the thrice hourly ferry across to Ahiritola, then switch to the Bagbazar boat for Kumartuli. From Belur Jetty (

Dakshineswar. Southbound ferries to Howrah via Bagbazar depart at 6.30pm and 8pm (plus 9.15am/1.30pm weekdays/Sunday).Dakshineswar
HINDU TEMPLE

The heart of this vibrant riverside complex is a cream-and-red 1847 Kali Temple shaped like an Indian Sacré-Coeur. The site is where Ramakrishna started his remarkable spiritual journey, and his small room in the outer northwest corner of the temple precinct is now a place of special meditative reverence. No photos, deposit shoes outside complex.
Several daily suburban trains from Sealdah run to Dakshineswar station (₹5, 20 minutes), 400m south of the temple. A metro extension is due to reach the same point by 2017, but for now you can either take painfully slow DN9/1 from Dum Dum metro. Or from the southwest side of Noapara metro, take an auto to Dunlop (₹10, a convoluted 15 minutes) then cross under the curling overpass and take bus 79 for five minutes. Hourly ferries from almost under the old Dakshineswar Bridge run to Belur Math (₹10). From around 200m further north, uncovered small boats do the same route much more frequently, but you'll have to sit cross legged in the sun (or rain), squashed with two dozen others for nearly half an hour. Bring a hat or umbrella.

 ; h5am-10pm, central shrine closed 2-4pm)
This ancient Kali temple is Kolkata’s holiest spot for Hindus and possibly the source of the city’s name. Today’s version is a 1809 rebuild with floral-and peacock-motif tiles that look more Victorian than Indian. More interesting than the architecture are the jostling pilgrim queues that snake into the main hall to fling hibiscus flowers at a crowned, three-eyed Kali image. There’s no need to join them to feel the atmosphere.
Behind the bell pavilion but still within the mandir complex, goats are ritually beheaded (generally mornings) to honour the ever-demanding goddess. To the direct east is a pea-green ‘holy pond’ and by the sanctuary's north perimeter, a ‘tree of fertility’.
Unless using their services to queue-jump into the central shrine hall, a token donation of ₹20 is sufficient for any impromptu temple guide. Donating ₹21 is even better – giving a sum ending in one is considered lucky and implies that you are familiar with local customs.

If it weren’t such an awkward trek by public transport, Kolkata’s lovely 109- hectare Botanical Gardens would make a great place to escape from the city’s sounds and smells. Founded in 1786, the gardens played an important role in cultivating tea long before the drink became a household commodity. Today there’s a cactus house, palm collection, river-overlook and a boating-lake with splendid Giant Amazon Lily pads.
The most touted attraction is the 250-year-old ‘world’s largest banyan tree’. That’s a little misleading: the central trunk rotted away in the 1920s, leaving an array of cross-branches and linked aerial roots so it looks more like a copse than a single tree. The banyan is five minutes’ walk from the park’s Bicentenary Gate on bus route 55A, or 25 minutes’ walk from the gardens’ main gate where bus 55 and minibus 6 terminate after a painfully slow drive from Esplanade via Howrah. Taxis from Shakespeare Sarani charge around ₹180 via the elegant Vidyasagar Setu (Hooghly Suspension Bridge).

Volunteering
Several organisations welcome foreign volunteers. A good place to meet other volunteers informally is at Raj’s Spanish Cafe.
Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity welcome all comers. There’s no minimum service period and no specific skills are required other than a warm heart and patience to empathise with those whose language you might not
understand. Start by attending a briefing at Sishu Bhavan (

(₹2200). Tours pass several well-known sites and add curiosities such as Kolkata’s giant trash-mountain, Tangra Chinatown, a burning ghat, a Shiva temple (join the prayers) and a brief drive through the red-light district. A similar, if adapted, tour by car costs ₹4000/4500 without/with AC for up to three people. Longer car tours to Belur Math, Dakshineswar and the Hooghly river- town sites as far as Bansberia’s Kremlin-styled palace temple costs ₹5000 per car. Ask about early morning bazaar tours.
Bus Tours
Full-day sightseeing bus tours (tour ₹450; h8.30am Tue-Sun) operated by West Bengal Tourism seem a relative bargain, but feel very rushed apart from the lengthy lunch stop. Cancelled if less than eight customers sign up.4 Sleeping Decent accommodation is expensive in Kolkata and budget places are often dismal. Even in many midrange hotels, peeling paint, loose wires, battered furniture and damp patches come as standard. Many cheaper hotels lock their gates by midnight, so if you’re planning a night on the tiles, check if there’s a late-entry procedure.
Top-end hotels can be very significantly discounted on websites such as www.yatra.com and www.booking.com, but midrange hotels are usually better value as walkins, while budget places rarely take bookings at all. The Salt Lake area has many business hotels but painfully slow transportation to most points of touristic interest means that travellers might regret staying there, at least until the metro Line 2 extension arrives.
Accommodation fills to bursting before and during Durga Puja. Occupancy drops noticeably afterwards (late October), but picks up again from mid- November to February.
SLEEPING PRICE RANGES
Accommodation price ranges for this chapter are: $ below ₹2000
$$ ₹2000-₹10,000
$$$ above ₹10,000
Prices quoted are for double rooms including tax (5% on rooms over ₹1000, 17.42% on those over ₹3000). When bargaining, double-check whether the quote is ‘plus plus’.
Around Sudder Street
The nearest Kolkata gets to a traveller ghetto is the area around helpfully located Sudder St. There’s a range of backpacker-oriented services, and a big advantage of arriving here is that virtually every second building is a guesthouse or hotel, ranging from Kolkata’s top five-star heritage palace to ultra-budget dives thatrepresent a whole new league of nastiness. When we list Sudder St area accommodation under ₹800, we’re usually identifying the least objectionable options rather than making a recommendation. For under ₹500 expect coffin- sized rooms where the main decor is the graffiti of previous inmates; long- standing ultra-cheapies in this gloomy bracket include Maria (

Taking guests since 1936, the Fairlawn is a characterful 1783 Raj-era home fronted by tropical greenery. The stairs and sitting room are smothered with photos, family mementos and articles celebrating the hotel’s long-term owner who passed away aged 94 in September 2014. Rooms are mostly spacious but less polished than you might anticipate. Indeed some are downright plain with little charm and old bathtubs over-painted rather than re-enamelled.

In an alley off Sudder St, the pleasant new block is dotted with square-framed artworks and has a boutiquey modern feel with lots of little extras (kettle, safe, fridge etc), though some walls suffer from damp-stains.
Beware that there's also a contrastingly unappealing old block. Rooms there, while large and partially refurbished, are approached via very dowdy stairs and, unlike new-block rooms, walls are stark, wi-fi doesn't work and the air-con is older.

Airport Area
Airport area hotels fall into two main clumps. Cheaper options are on or near Jessore Rd which approximately parallels the runway to the west. Bigger, flashier but rarely luxurious hotels are spread out along VIP Rd between 1.5km and 3km south of the terminal and can be accessed for ₹6 by 'Baguiati' autosfrom Airport Gate 1.

5 Eating Don’t miss sampling Bengali cuisine, a wonderful discovery once you’ve mastered a whole new culinary vocabulary. Cheaper Bengali places often serve tapas-sized portions, so order two or three dishes per person along with either rice or luchi (Bengali flatbread), plus some sweet khejur (chutney).
A Kolkata delight is making streetside tea stops for ₹5 mini-cuppas served in disposable bhaar (environmentally friendly earthenware cups).
Plentiful branches of Starbuck-style chains Barista, Aqua Java and Café Coffee Day make air-conditioned oases in which to sip a decent macchiato. And some offer wi-fi.
Most restaurants add 19.4% tax to food bills (included in prices quoted here). Posher places add service fees too. Tips are welcome at cheaper places and expected at most expensive restaurants. Times Food Guide
(www.timescity.com/kolkata; book ₹199) and Zomato (www.zomato.com/kolkata) offer
hundreds of restaurant reviews.
BENGALI FOOD
Fruity and mildly spiced, Bengali food favours the sweet, rich notes of jaggery (palm- sugar), daab (young coconut), malaikari (coconut milk) and posto (poppy seed). Typical Bengali curry types include the light, coriander-scented jhol, drier spicier jhal and richer, ginger-based kalia. Strong mustard notes feature in shorshe curries and paturi dishes that come steamed in a banana leaf. Gobindobhog bhaat (steamed rice) or luchi (small puris) are the usual accompaniment. More characteristic than meat or murgir (chicken) are chingri (river prawns) and excellent fish, particularly rohu (white rui), fatty chital and cod-like bhekti. If you can handle the bones, ilish (hilsa) is considered the tastiest fish, kachki are very small and lau ghonto – an acquired taste – is fish head pounded with pumpkin. Excellent vegetarian choices include mochar ghonto (mashed banana-flower, sometimes with potato and coconut), doi begun (eggplant in curd) and shukto, a favourite lunchtime starter combining at least five different vegetables in a milk-based sauce.

Bengal’s trademark fast food is the kati roll: a paratha roti, fried with a coating of egg then filled with sliced onions, chilli and your choice of stuffing (curried chicken, grilled meat or paneer). Generally eaten as a takeaway from hole-in-the-wall serveries. Famed

Around Sudder Street
A few relatively basic traveller cafes around Sudder St serve backpacker favourites including banana pancakes, muesli and toasted sandwiches complemented by fresh fruit juices and a range of good-value Indian dishes. Eateries across Mirza Ghalib St cater predominantly to Bangladeshi tastes. Cheap places for Indian-regional food lie around New Market (notably Hogg St),

6 Drinking & Nightlife Cheaper bars are mostly dingy and overwhelmingly male-dominated with a penchant for over- loud music, often sung by scantily clad females.
Most better bars and clubs are in hotels. Clubs open till 2am or later on party nights (Wednesday, Friday and Saturday) but other evenings they're typically half empty and closed by midnight. Note the difference between entry charge and cover charge: the latter can be recouped in drinks or food to the same value. Either is charged per couple. Women can often enter free but single men (known as 'stags') are generally excluded altogether and certainly aren’t expected to dance without a female partner, heaven forbid.Central Kolkata & Chowringhee

book to read as waits can be very long but there are seats. On arrival, take and fill in a booking form (forms are numbered and double as queuing chits). Lines form well before opening. It's sometimes quicker to use the nearby standard
computerised booking office ( 
8am-2pm Sun) but that has no tourist quota.

If you need a Bangladeshi visa, it should have Darsana marked as the entry point. Buy tickets up to 10 days ahead.
For a certain commission, Sudder St travel agencies can save you the trek to the ticket office and can sometimes manage to find tickets on ‘full’ trains.8 Getting Around Tickets for buses, trams and the metro on most city transport routes cost from ₹4 to ₹15. Men shouldn’t sit in assigned ‘Ladies’ seats’.
Beware: around 1pm much of the city’s one-way road system reverses direction, so bus routes invert and taxis can prove reluctant to make journeys around this time.around this time.TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
NSBIA Airport is around 16km northeast of central Kolkata. A feeder loop road accesses the new combined terminal from the south (VIP Rd) via Airport Gate 1. Busy Jessore Rd approximately parallels the runway to a second, smaller access through Airport Gate 2, around 400m west of the largely disused old terminals.
AC Bus
Airport buses start from a stand that's a minute's walk north from arrivals door
1A (between the new and old terminals). Pay on board. Bus VS1 ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ; one-way ₹50; h8am-7.30pm) runs every half hour to Esplanade,
returning from a the walled government-bus compound in Esplanade Bus Station (around one hour). Bus VS2 runs to Howrah.
City Bus
Cheap but very slow minibus 151 to BBD Bagh (₹10) and relatively infrequent bus 46 to Esplanade via VIP Rd start from the VIP Rd/Jessore Rd junction near Airport Gate 1. Bus 30B from Jessore Rd runs to Babughat.
Metro
The airport metro-spur line from Noapara should be operational by 2017. For now the closest station is Dum Dum, 5km southwest by buses 30B and DN9/1 from Airport Gate 2/Jessore Rd.
Taxi
Fixed-price taxis cost ₹345/455 to Sudder St/Howrah taking around 50 minutes/one hour when traffic is kind. Pre-pay at booth 12 in the new arrivals area between exits 3B and 4.
AUTOS
Tuk-tuk-style autorickshaws ('autos') operate as fixed-route hop-on share-taxis with three passengers in the back and one beside the driver. Fares are typically ₹6 to ₹10, depending on distance.
Key routes:
Dharamtala–Loha Pool Starts from Park Circus using Park St (or after 1pm looping via Nasreddin and Karaya roads), goes up AJC Bose Rd, (near Mother Teresa's Motherhouse), along Elliot/Royd then up Mirza Ghalib/RAK Rd(mornings/afternoons) near Sudder St. Loops reverse after 1pm.
Hazra–Bondel ( Das Park Metro.
GOOGLE MAP
 ) Along Hazra Rd, starting a block east of Jatin
Hazra–Khiddapur West from Jatin Das Park Metro, past the Kalighat idolmakers and on through Alipore.
BUS & TRAM
Buses and minibuses are more frequent but photogenic battered old trams follow somewhat more predictable routes and are immune to one-way traffic.
FERRY
Crossing the Hoogly is generally faster and more agreeable by boat than by using the clogged road bridges. Ferries (tickets ₹5-10; h8am-8pm) depart every 15 to 20 minutes from Howrah to jetties in central Kolkata; other useful routes are Howrah–Ahritola–Sovabazar–Bagbazar (for Kumartuli), Ahritola–Bandaghat and Belur–Dakshineswar.
METRO
Kolkata’s busy metro (www.mtp.indianrailways.gov.in; h7am-9.45pm Mon-Sat, 2-9.45pm Sun)
has trains every five to 15 minutes. For Sudder St, use Esplanade or Park St. Only one line is operational so far but several extensions are planned. Line 2
(http://kmrc.in) linking Howrah, Sealdah and Salt Lake is due by late 2015. Theoretically you may not carry bags over 10kg.
RICKSHAW
Human-powered ‘tana rickshaws’ work within limited areas, notably around New Market. Although rickshaw pullers sometimes charge foreigners disproportionate fares, many are virtually destitute, sleeping on the pavements beneath their rented chariots at night, so tips are heartily appreciated.
SUBURBAN TRAINS
Sealdah–Dum Dum–Dakshineswar trains run roughly hourly. The Kidderpore– BBD Bagh–Bagbazar–Chitpore–Dum Dum route is rush hour only. Biman Bandar is the airport station but only a couple of daily services stop there.
TAXIKolkata’s yellow Ambassador cabs charge ₹25 for up to 1.9km. Most have 'new' digital meters that simply show the fare due. However, a few have old mechanical meters for which there's a conversion chart: expect to pay around 240% of that reading. Taxis are generally easy to flag down except during the
5pm to 6pm rush hour and after 10pm when some cabs refuse to use the meter. After 9pm, drivers might reasonably ask double fare if they can’t expect to find a return ride.
There are prepaid taxi booths at Howrah Station, Sealdah Station and at the airport.West Bengal & Darjeeling

West Bengal & DarjeelingWhy Go?
A sliver of fertile land running from the tea-draped Himalayan foothills to the sultry mangroves of the Bay of Bengal, West Bengal offers a remarkable range of destinations and experiences to find within a single state. In the tropical southern areas, the sea-washed hamlet of Mandarmani vies for attention with Bishnupur's ornate terracotta-tiled Hindu temples and palaces. The striped Bengal tiger stealthily swims through muddy rivulets in the Sunderbans, while a bunch of European-style ghost towns line the banks of the Hooghly (Ganges) further upstream as reminders of the state's maritime heyday. In the cool northern hills, the toy train chugs its way up to the charming British-era hill station of Darjeeling, revered for its ringside views of massive Khangchendzonga. There's also a vibrant art scene, delectable cuisine and a genuinely hospitable population where friends are easy to make and hard to lose.
When to Go
A Oct–Dec & Mar–May Best for hill views, trekking and spring blooms up north.
A Oct–Mar Best time for avoiding the heat on the lower southern plains.
A Jan Ideal for navigating the dense mangrove forests of the Sunderbans TigerReserve.

History Referred to as Bongo in the Mahabharata, Bengal was part of the Mauryan empire in the 3rd century BC, and was successively controlled by the Guptas, the Buddhist Palas and the Muslim sultans of Delhi over time. Following the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, Bengal became an independent Islamic state.
The British East India Company established a trading post in Kolkata (Calcutta) in 1698, which quickly prospered and outshone other European outposts along the Hooghly River belonging to Portuguese, Dutch and Danish merchants. Annoyed by rapid British expansion, Siraj-ud-daula, the nawab of Bengal, marched out of his capital at Murshidabad and easily took Kolkata in 1756. Robert Clive defeated him the following year at the Battle of Plassey, helped by the treachery of Siraj-ud-daula’s uncle, Mir Jafar, a commander in the nawab’s army. Jafar succeeded his nephew as nawab, but after the Battle of Buxar in 1764 the British took full control of Bengal.
West Bengal was the cradle of the Indian Renaissance and national freedom movement, and has long been considered the country’s cultural and intellectual heartland   Calcutta was the political capital of India until the British shiftedheartland – Calcutta was the political capital of India until the British shifted office to Delhi in 1931. In 1947, Indian Independence from Britain – and the subsequent partition of the country – saw the state of Bengal (which had already been split for administrative purposes in 1905) divided into Hindu-predominant West Bengal and Muslim-oriented Bangladesh, causing the upheaval and migration of millions of Bengalis.
Starting in the late 1980s, Darjeeling's demand for political autonomy saw phases of unrest in the state's northern mountains, and eventually led to the establishment of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration in 2012, which has stabilised the situation.
2 Activities
Trekking
There are enjoyable walks along pine-scented trails in all of West Bengal’s hill stations, but the most popular place for a multiday trek is Singalila Ridge, near Darjeeling, where teahouse-style trekking is possible. Camping treks are available elsewhere, including around Kalimpong.
Wildlife Watching
The Sunderbans remains the state's prime forest area for spying on species such as crocs, Gangetic dolphins, deer, water monitors, myriad bird species and the Royal Bengal tiger. In the jungles of Jaldhapara, you can get up close with elephants and grumpy rhinos.
8 Getting There & Around Most tourists enter West Bengal through Kolkata, which is connected by air to Delhi, Mumbai, Bangkok, Dubai, Doha, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Hong Kong and Kathmandu. Siliguri’s Bagdogra airport has services to Kolkata, Delhi and Guwahati, as well as daily helicopter flights to Gangtok.
Most land arrivals are by train: main lines run south to Bhubaneswar and Chennai, and west to Gaya, Varanasi and Delhi. Other lines connect Assam in Northeast India and Jharkhand in the west. Numerous long-distance buses also connect surrounding statesconnect surrounding states.
Overcrowded ‘share jeeps’ with cramped back seats ply the winding roads of the West Bengal hills.
SOUTH OF KOLKATA
Sunderbans Tiger Reserve
Home to one of the largest concentrations of Royal Bengal tigers on the planet, the 2585-sq-km Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (admission/video ₹50/200; hdawn- dusk) is a network of channels and semisubmerged mangroves that forms the world’s largest river delta. The ecosystem here is contiguous with the Sunderbans delta in Bangladesh, which lies eastward across the international border along the same shoreline. Tigers (officially estimated to number close to 300) lurk in the impenetrable depths of the mangrove forests, and also swim the delta’s innumerable channels. Although they do sometimes kill villagers and their livestock, tigers are typically shy and sightings are rare. Nevertheless, cruising the broad waterways through the world’s biggest mangrove sanctuary (now a Unesco World Heritage Site) and watching wildlife, whether it be a spotted deer, 2m-long water monitor or luminescent kingfisher, is a world away from Kolkata’s chaos.
The best time to visit the reserve is between November and March – entry is restricted through the late summer and monsoon months. Organised tours are the best way to navigate this tricky and harsh landscape, not least because all your permits, paperwork, guiding duties and logistical problems are taken care of. In fact, travelling alone is not recommended.
At Sajnekhali, the official gateway into the reserve, you’ll find the Mangrove Interpretation Centre (Sajnekhali; h8.30am-5pm) with a small turtle and crocodile hatchery, a collection of pickled wildlife and a blackboard with the date of the last tiger-spotting chalked up. Motorboats (₹600) and guides (₹600) are available for hire near the site.T Tours Tour prices vary widely. They typically include return transport from Kolkata, accommodation, food, park entry fees, as well as guide-and boat-hire charges. Do check what is and isn’t included.

SPA TREATS
Looking to experience the best of rural Bengal while treating yourself to a spot of wellness and luxury? Head to one of these two recommended spa resorts, set amid scenic landscapes, and indulge in some of the best comforts and therapies, while soaking up the bucolic charms of the region.
Hemmed by blooming vegetable gardens and centred on a tree-lined lake only an hour's drive north of Kolkata is Vedic Village (%9830025900; www.thevedicvillage.com; Shikharpur village; r from ₹8500; ais), a luxury resort known as much for its fine hospitality as its showcase facility – a speciality spa-cum-naturopathy clinic that's touted to be the first (and best) medical spa in the country. Long-stay treatment packages, built around several sessions of consultation with in-house doctors, can be customised upon prior notice. Casual holidaymakers can simply kick back in one of the luxury villas, de- stress to the chirping of myriad bird species, tuck into mouth-watering cuisine, or float in the ultramarine waters of the swimming pool.
En route to Diamond Harbour, about two hours south of Kolkata, stands Ganga Kutir (%033-40404040; www.gangakutir.com; Sarisa village, Raichak; r incl breakfast from ₹15,299; ais), another popular destination for those wanting some solitude. Located on the banks of the Hooghly, this swish resort offers a range of wellness packages which – paired with yoga and meditation – are a great nourisher for tired sinews. Accommodation is in chic suites appointed with snazzy mural-covered walls and great river views.
Mandarmani
%03220
About 180km south of Kolkata, the sleepy fishing village of Mandarmani sports a heavenly beach stretching nearly 15km. It remains one of the more unpolluted beaches in the country, and supports countless colonies of sand bubbler crabs. The beaches see some additional action at dawn, when fishing boats drop anchor and disgorge their catches of marine goodies.
Adventure Zone (%9830033896; www.aboutadventure.org; Mandarmani) conducts
parasailing (₹600) on the beaches, and offers an adventure-sports package (₹1200) that includes kayaking, zip-lining, rock climbing and rappelling.Sana Beach (%9330633111; www.mandarmanihotels.com; d incl breakfast from ₹2850;
as), at the far end of the beach, is by far the best among all the resorts lining Mandarmani's sands. It has a mix of comfy rooms done up in cheerful hues, ethno-chic cottages and tents, a lovely swimming pool and a good bar-cum- restaurant.
To get there, take the 6.40am 12857 Tamralipta Express (2nd class/chair ₹100/365, 3½ hours) from Kolkata’s Howrah Station to Digha. A taxi trip from there costs about ₹500.
SAGAR FESTIVAL
According to Hindu legend, Sagar Island – at the confluence of the Ganges – was where King Sagar's 60,000 sons were brought back to life by the flowing river after they had been reduced to ashes by a sage named Kapil Muni. Each year in January, the Ganga Sagar Mela is held here, near the Kapil Muni Temple, honouring the legend. The best way to see the festival is the two-day, one-night boat tour operated from Kolkata by West Bengal Tourism (www.wbtdc.gov.in), with accommodation on board (per person all- inclusive from ₹8000). The island hibernates for the rest of the year.
Buses (₹60, two hours) run frequently from Kolkata's Esplanade bus stand to Namkhana pier, from where ferries ply to the island. Buses and share taxis shuttle within the island between points of tourist interest.
NORTH OF KOLKATA
Up the Hooghly
Serampore, on the Hooghly River, about 25km north of Kolkata, was a Danish trading centre until Denmark’s holdings in India were transferred to the British East India Company in 1845. Serampore College was founded in 1818 by the first Baptist missionary to India, William Carey, and houses a library that was once one of the largest in the country.
Further upstream is the former French outpost of Chandarnagar. Here you can visit the Eglise du Sacre Coeur (Sacred Heart Church) and the nearby 18th- century mansion now housing the Cultural Institut de Chandarnagar(h11am-5.30pm, closed Thu & Sat), with collections documenting this colonial-era
outpost. In November, there are gorgeous public lighting displays for Jagaddhatri Puja, a festival devoted to the worship of an incarnation of the Hindu mother goddess. Enthusiastic locals throng festive arenas to pay their respects to gigantic clay idols of the four-armed deity, housed in temporary pavilions called pandals.
In 1571 the Portuguese set up a factory in Bandel, 41km north of Kolkata and close to Saptagram, which was an important Portuguese trading port long before Kolkata rose to prominence. Here, you can climb the lofty clock tower of the
romantically crumbling Imambara (admission ₹5; h8am-6pm Apr-Jul, to 5.30pm Aug-Nov,
to 5pm Dec-Mar), which has breathtaking views of the river. The building was constructed in 1861 as a centre for learning and worship. Only 1km south of Bandel, Chinsurah was ceded by the Dutch to the British in exchange for Sumatra in 1825. There are dilapidated ruins of a fort and a cemetery, about 1km to the west.
About 6km north of Hooghly, Bansberia has two interesting temples. The 13 sikharas (spires) of the Hanseswari Temple look like something you’d expect to see in St Petersburg, while the ornate terracotta tiles covering the Vasudev Temple resemble those seen in Bishnupur.
To visit these settlements on a day tour from Kolkata, take any Bandel-bound local train (₹14, one hour, hourly) from Howrah Station, or hire a taxi for the day (₹2600). There aren't too many restaurants in the area, so carry a packed lunch.
TOP FESTIVALS
Ganga Sagar Mela (Sagar Island; hmid-Jan) Hundreds of thousands of Hindu pilgrims converge where the Ganges meets the sea, to bathe en masse in a riotous festival. Bengali New Year (Naba Barsha; Statewide; hmid-Apr) A holiday celebrating the first day of the Bengali calendar, also called Nabo Barsho.
Rath Yatra (Chariot Festival; Statewide; hJul/Aug) Celebrated by pulling the juggernaut of Lord Jagannath's chariot.
Dussehra (Durga Puja; hSep/Oct) Across the state, especially in Kolkata, temporary pandals (pavilions) are raised and intense celebrations take place to worship the Hindu goddess Durga. After four colourful days, beautiful clay idols of the 10-armed deity areimmersed in the rivers.
Jagaddhatri Puja (Chandarnagar; hNov) Honours the Hindu goddess Jagaddhatri, an incarnation of Durga.
Poush Mela (23 to 26 December, Shantiniketan) Folk music, dance, theatre and Baul songs radiate across the university town.
Bishnupur
%03244 / Pop 61,900
Known for its beautiful terracotta temples, Bishnupur flourished as the capital of the Malla kings from the 16th to the early 19th centuries. The architecture of these intriguing temples (Indian/foreigner ₹10/250; hdawn-dusk) is a bold mix of Bengali, Islamic and Oriya (Odishan) styles. Intricately detailed facades of numerous temples play out scenes of the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata. The most striking structures include the Jor Bangla, Madan Mohan Temple, the multiarched Ras Mancha and the elaborate Shyam Rai Temple. You need to pay for your ticket at Ras Mancha and show it at the other temples. Cycle-rickshaw-wallahs offer tours (the best way to negotiate the labyrinth of lanes) for ₹300.
There’s a small museum (admission ₹10; h11am-7pm Tue-Sun) that’s worth a look for its painted manuscript covers, stone friezes, musical instruments and folk-art gallery.
Bishnupur is in Bankura district, famous for its Baluchari silk saris and its pottery, particularly the stylised terracotta Bankura horse. Reproductions of detailed terracotta tiles from the temples are sold everywhere.
Bishnupur Tourist Lodge (%03244-252013; www.wbtourism.gov.in; College Rd; d from
₹800; a), flaunting a red-and-white exterior, is perhaps the best place to sleep in town, with clean pastel-shaded rooms and a good bar-cum-restaurant. It’s close to the museum and a ₹50 rickshaw ride from the train station. It’s often full, so book ahead.
Regular buses run from Bishnupur to Kolkata (₹140, five hours). For Shantiniketan (₹100, four hours) you have to change in Durgapur. Two fast trains run daily to Howrah (2nd class/chair ₹140/505, four hours): the 6.25am12883 Rupashi Bangla Express and the 4.50pm 12827 Howrah Purulia Express.
PALACES GALORE
Thrown around the vicinity of Kolkata's city limits are a handful of rajbaris or palaces belonging to families of erstwhile zamindars (landowners). While most of them stand delapidated and forlorn, a few have recently made a promising turnaround and joined the top-end tourism bandwagon. Among the few palaces offering a luxury experience woven around the bygone regal life is the palace of Itachuna (%9830142389;
www.itachunarajbari.com; Halusai village; d from ₹2700; a), 110km from Kolkata. It packs a punch with its renovated stately interiors, fine Bengali food and an overall bucolic ambience. The palace of Bawali (%9830383008; www.therajbari.com; Bawali village; d incl breakfast from ₹13,500; a), a one-hour drive south of Kolkata, also makes for a lovely getaway, with a striking doric-pillared facade, carefully preserved distressed decor and excellent overall hospitality.
Shantiniketan
%03463
In addition to epitomising its Bengali name – meaning 'abode of peace' – Shantiniketan is a veritable nerve centre of Bengal's art and culture. Nobel laureate, poet and artist Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) founded a school here amid pastoral settings in 1901. It later developed into the Visva Bharati University, with an emphasis on the study of liberal arts as well as humanity’s relationship with nature. A relaxed place, it attracts students from all over India and overseas.
Spread throughout the leafy university grounds are eclectic statues, the celebrated Shantiniketan murals and the Belgian glass-panelled university
prayer hall. The Museum & Art Gallery (adult/student ₹10/5; h10.30am-1pm & 2-
4.30pm Thu-Mon, to 1pm Tue) within the Uttarayan complex (Tagore’s former home) are worth a peek if you are a Tagore aficionado. Reproductions of his sketches and paintings are sold here.
Subarnarekha bookshop near the post office has plenty of Tagore’s titles (₹100 to ₹250) in English. Around Shantiniketan, several practitioners ofclassical dance, music, pottery and painting offer casual short-term courses to visiting students. Ask the helpful staff at Subarnarekha.

Across the river from Nabadwip, Mayapur is the headquarters of the Iskcon (Hare Krishna) movement. There’s a large, colourful temple and the basic but

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
GAUR & PANDUA
Rising from the flooded paddy fields of Gaur (355km from Kolkata) are mosques and other crumbling ruins of the 13th-to 16th-century capital of the Muslim nawabs of Bengal. Little remains from the 7th-to 12th-century pre-Muslim period, when Gaur was the capital of the successive Buddhist Pala and Hindu Sena dynasties.
Hiding behind lush mango orchards, the most graceful monuments in this area are the impressive Baradwari Mosque (1526) – the arcaded aisle of its corridor still intact – and the fortress-like gateway of Dakhil Darwaza (1425). The Qadam Rasul Mosque enshrines the flat footprint of the Prophet Mohammed. Remnants of colourful enamel cling to the Chamkan Mosque and the Gumti Gate nearby.
In Pandua (about 25km from Gaur) are the vast ruins of the 14th-century Adina Masjid, once India’s largest mosque. About 2km away is the Eklakhi Mausoleum, so called because it cost 1 lakh (₹100,000) to build back in 1431.
To visit these forgotten relics, board the 3.25pm 13011 Howrah–Malda Intercity Express (2nd class/chair ₹130/465, 7½ hours) from Kolkata. Accommodation is available in Malda (15km from Gaur and 30km from Pandua) at Hotel Kalinga (%03512- 283567; hotelkalinga@gmail.com; NH34, Ram Krishna Pally; d ₹1000; a), which has basic rooms, friendly service and palatable in-house food. For touring the monuments, it's best to hire a taxi from Malda for the day (₹2200).Murshidabad & Berhampore
%03482 / Pop 170,300
In Murshidabad, rural Bengali life and 18th-century architecture meld on the verdant shores of the Bhagirathi River. When Siraj-ud-daula was nawab of Bengal, Murshidabad was his capital, and he was assassinated here after the defeat at Plassey (now Palashi).
The main draw here is the palace of Hazarduari (Indian/foreigner ₹10/250; h10am- 4.30pm Sat-Thu), a palace famous for its 1000 doors (real and false), built here for the nawabs in 1837. It houses an astonishing collection of antiquities from the 18th and 19th centuries. Other beautiful structures in the complex include the Nizamat Imambara, the clock tower, the Wasef Manzil, a former regal residence, and the elegant Madina Mosque.
Murshid Quli Khan, who moved the capital here in 1700, is buried beneath the stairs at the impressive ruins of the Katra Mosque. Siraj-ud-daula was assassinated at the Nimak Haram Deori (Traitor’s Gate). Within the Kathgola Gardens (admission ₹10; h6.30am-5.30pm) is an interesting family mansion of a Jain trading family, dating back to 1873.
Berhampore is 15km south of Murshidabad and acts as its bus and railway hub.

JEEPJEEP
An efficient and relatively comfortable way of getting around the hills is by share jeep. There are a number of jeep stands lining Hill Cart Rd: for Darjeeling (₹150, three hours) and Kurseong (₹80, 1½ hours) look around opposite the bus terminal or outside the Conclave Hotel until late afternoon; for Kalimpong (₹120, 2½ hours) head to the Panitanki Mall stand on Sevoke Rd (take an autoricksaw for ₹20); and for Gangtok (₹200, four hours) jeeps leave from next to the SNT terminal until around 4pm. Share and charter jeeps for all these destinations also leave from NJP train station. Mirik-bound jeeps (₹100, 2½ hours) leave most frequently from Siliguri train station, 200m southwest from the central bus terminal.
Chartering a jeep privately costs roughly 15 times that of a shared ticket. An option for XL-sized travellers is to pay for and occupy the front two or three seats next to the driver.
A prepaid taxi stand at Bagdogra Airport offers fixed fares to Darjeeling (₹2200), Gangtok (₹2400), Kakarbhitta (₹600) and even Bhadrapur in Nepal (₹1200), allowing you to bypass Siliguri completely. It’s not difficult to hook up with other airline passengers to share the cost.

BORDER CROSSING – BANGLADESH, BHUTAN & NEPAL TO/FROM BANGLADESH
A number of private agencies in Siliguri, including Shyamoli (

%9932628243; Hill Cart Rd, 1km northwest of the central bus station, Hotel Central Plaza complex, Mallagauri More), run daily AC buses direct to Dhaka (₹1200, 18 hours), departing at
1.30pm. You’ll need to complete border formalities at Chengrabandha. Book a day or two in advance.
Buses also run every 45 minutes from the Tenzing Norgay Central Bus Terminal to Chengrabandha (₹80, 2½ hours) between 7am and 6pm. The border post is open from 8am to 6pm daily. From near the border post you can catch buses on to Rangpur, Bogra and Dhaka. Visas for Bangladesh can be obtained in Kolkata and New Delhi.
TO/FROM BHUTAN
Bhutan Transport Services runs two daily buses from Sevoke Rd, Siliguri, to Phuentsholing (₹90, departs 7.15am and noon), and there are many more local buses to Jaigon on the Indian side of the border, where you clear Indian immigration. Non-Indian nationals need visa clearance from a Bhutanese tour operator to enter Bhutan.
TO/FROM NEPAL
For Nepal, local buses pass the Tenzing Norgay Central Bus Terminal on Hill Cart Rd in Siliguri every 30 minutes for the border town of Panitanki (₹30, one hour). Nearby shared jeeps to Kakarbhitta (₹80 to ₹100) are faster but only leave when full. The Indian border post in Panitanki is officially open 24 hours but the Nepali post in Kakarbhitta is open from 7am to 7pm. Onward from Kakarbhitta there are numerous buses to Kathmandu (17 hours) and other destinations. Bhadrapur Airport, 23km southwest of Kakarbhitta, has regular flights to Kathmandu on Buddha Air (www.buddhaair.com). Visas for Nepal can be obtained at the border (bring two passport photos).
Jaldhapara Wildlife Sanctuary%03563 / Elev 60m
The little-visited Jaldhapara Wildlife Sanctuary (%03563-262239;
www.jaldapara.in; Indian/foreigner ₹50/200, camera/video ₹50/500; hmid-Sep–mid-Jun) protects
114 sq km of lush forests and grasslands along the Torsa River and is a refuge for 150 Indian one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis).
The best time to visit is mid-November to April, with March and April being the best months for wildlife spotting. Your best chance of spotting a rhino is on
an elephant ride (%03563-262230; Indian/foreigner per hour ₹200/600; h5-8am), though
these lumbering safaris are often booked out by the tourist lodges. Even if you are staying at Jaldhapara Tourist Lodge for a night you are not guaranteed a ride, as full occupancy is double that of their daily elephant quota. Weekdays offer the best chance, since local tourist footfall is almost nil.
Jeep safaris (%03563-262230; 4/8 passengers ₹2000/2400) operate in the early
morning and afternoon and stop at viewing platforms, but these can be hard to arrange unless you are on a tour.
The West Bengal tourist offices in Kolkata and Siliguri organise weekend

Mithun of Wild Planet Travel Desk (%9735028733; easthimalayan3@yahoo.com) and Hotel Relax can often book accommodation and elephant rides when no one else can and is probably your best option for a DIY trip. Budget travellers should bear in mind that an hour-long elephant ride will cost at least US$50 per person, after all costs are added in.

This functional but spiffy WBTDC (West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation) hotel is just outside the park in Madarihat town. It has rooms in wooden and concrete blocks or in new cottages. Weekends can be a bad time to check in, as the place is swamped with noisy local families and youth groups.
The lodge doesn't take direct bookings, bookings are made via West Bengal Tourist Office.
8 Getting There & Away Jaldhapara is 124km east of Siliguri. Local buses run frequently from Siliguri to Madarihat (₹80, four hours) between 11.40am and 4.30pm. There are also slow but scenic mail trains (unreserved seat ₹40 to ₹65, three to four hours), leaving Siliguri Junction at 8.20am, 5.10pm and 6pm, returning from Madarihat at 6.05am, 7.50am and 1.30pm.
From Madarihat, it's a 7km trip to the park headquarters. A return taxi costs ₹600, including waiting time, plus you’ll also have to pay the ₹200 vehicleentry fee.
Kurseong
%0354 Pop 40,100 Elev 1460m
Kurseong, 32km south of Darjeeling, is a tiny and bustling hill town best known for its formidable league of tea estates and a rush of Raj-era boarding schools that dot its extents. Its name derives from the Lepcha word khorsang, a reference to the small white orchid prolific in this area. Flanked by hilly slopes draped with manicured tea estates, it is also currently the southern terminus for the charming toy trains of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway.
Hill Cart Rd (Tenzing Norgay Rd) – the noisy, traffic-choked main thoroughfare from Siliguri to Darjeeling – and its remarkably close shadow, the railway line, wind through town.
There are numerous good walks in the area. Eagle’s Crag (2km return) affords splendid views down the Teesta Valley and the steamy plains to the south. St Mary's Hill (4km) takes you past atmospheric grottos and churches into charming pine forests that lead all the way up to a spectacular mountain ridge.

TEA ESTATE
If you like tea you should visit this organic and biodynamic tea estate; the factory is open to visitors. In-between the huge sorting and drying machines, and the fields of green bushes you may run into the owner, tea guru and local character Rajah Banerjee. Mornings are the best time to see the production process. Visits are free, or you can opt for a program of tea plucking, tasting and lunch in a local homestay for ₹300.
The estate is 3km below Kurseong along Pankhabari Rd, and 1km below Cochrane Pl. A taxi here costs ₹200, or it’s a pleasant downhill walk (it’s much steeper coming back so take a ₹20 shared taxi from Cochrane Pl). En route, the lush, overgrown old graveyard at St Andrew's has poignant reminders of the tea-planter era.

Darjeeling
%0354 Pop 120,400 Elev 2135m
Spread in ribbons over a steep mountain ridge, surrounded by emerald-green tea plantations and towered over by the majestic Khangchendzonga (8598m), Darjeeling is the definitive Indian hill station. Dating back to the Raj era, it's arguably West Bengal’s premier attraction, and promises some interesting exploration for the curious traveller. When you aren’t gazing open-mouthed at Khangchendzonga, you can explore colonial-era architecture, visit Buddhist monasteries, and spot snow leopards and red pandas at the nearby zoo. On the steep and bustling streets winding through town, you can lose yourself amid an array of Himalayan faces from Sikkim, Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet. And finally, when energies start to flag, a good, steaming Darjeeling brew is never far away.
Most tourists visit Darjeeling in autumn (October and November) and spring (mid-March to mid-May) when skies are dry, panoramas are clear and temperatures are pleasant. Winters can be cold here, so bring an extra jumper if visiting from December to February. The rainy months (June to September) can be extremely wet and are best avoided.
Darjeeling sprawls over a west-facing slope in a confusing web of interconnecting roads and steep flights of steps. Expect an uphill hike to your hotel if arriving at the train station or jeep stand. The two main squares – Chowrasta, near the top of town, and Clubside junction – are linked by pedestrianised Nehru Rd (aka The Mall), which doubles as the main shopping street Hill Cart Rd (aka Tenzing Norgay Rd) runs the length of the bustlingstreet. Hill Cart Rd (aka Tenzing Norgay Rd) runs the length of the bustling lower bazaar and is Darjeeling’s major vehicle thoroughfare.
History Darjeeling originally belonged to the Buddhist chogyals (kings) of Sikkim until 1780, when it was annexed by invading Gurkhas from Nepal. The East India Company gained control of the region in 1816, but soon returned most of the lands to Sikkim in exchange for British control over any future border disputes.
During one such dispute in 1828, two British officers stumbled across the Dorje Ling monastery, on a tranquil forested ridge, and passed word to Kolkata (Calcutta) that it would be a perfect site for a sanatorium (they were sure to have also mentioned its strategic military importance in the region). The chogyal of Sikkim (still grateful for the return of his kingdom) agreed to lease the uninhabited land to the East India Company for the annual fee of £3000. In 1835, the hill station of Darjeeling was born and the first tea bushes were planted. By 1857, the population of Darjeeling had reached 10,000, mainly because of a massive influx of Gurkha tea labourers from Nepal.
Since Independence, the Gurkhas have become the main political force in Darjeeling. Friction with the state government led to calls for a separate state of Gorkhaland in the 1980s. In 1986, violence and riots orchestrated by the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) brought Darjeeling to a standstill. As a result, the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) was given a large measure of autonomy from the state government. Calls for full secession have resurfaced in recent years, leading to the replacement in 2012 of the DGHC by the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA). The political situation is now calm.Darjeeling

Tiger Hill
VIEWPOINT( 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
To watch the dawn light break over a spectacular 250km stretch of Himalayan horizon, including Everest (8848m), Lhotse (8501m) and Makalu (8475m) to the far west, rise early and jeep out to Tiger Hill (2590m), 11km south of Darjeeling, above Ghum. The skyline is dominated by Khangchendzonga (great five-peaked snow fortress), India’s highest peak and the world’s third-highest. On either side of the main massif are Kabru (7338m), Jannu (7710m) and Pandim (6691m), all serious peaks in their own right.
This daily morning spectacle (views are best in autumn and spring) is a major tourist attraction, and you'll find hundreds of jeeps leaving Darjeeling for Tiger Hill every morning at 4am – traffic snarls en route are quite common. At the summit you can either pay ₹10 to stand in the pavilion grounds or warm up in one of the heated lounges in the pavilion (₹20 to ₹40). It can be a real bunfight here, so we suggest you simply find yourself a ringside spot in the open courtyard in front of the pavilion, from where the views are equally grand.
Organised sunrise trips (usually with a detour to Batasia Loop on the way back) can be booked through a travel agency or directly with jeep drivers at the Clubside taxi stand. Return trips cost ₹1200 per vehicle.
Observatory Hill
SACRED SITE

Sacred to both Buddhists and Hindus, this hill was the site of the original Dorje Ling monastery that gave the town its name. Today, devotees come to a temple in a small cave to honour Mahakala, a Buddhist protector deity also worshipped in Hinduism as a wrathful avatar of Shiva the destroyer. The summit is marked by several shrines, a flurry of colourful prayer flags and the ringing notes from numerous devotional bells.
A path leading up to the hill through giant Japanese cedars starts about 300m along Bhanu Bhakta Sarani from Chowrasta; watch out for marauding monkeys. Disappointingly, there are no mountain views, but the still, pine-scented ambience is worth taking in.

Tucked away within the grounds of the zoo, this prestigious mountaineering institute was founded in 1954 and has provided training for some of India’s leading mountaineers. Within the complex is the fascinating Mountaineering Museum. It houses sundry details and memorabilia from the 1922 and 1924 Everest expeditions, which set off from Darjeeling, as well as more recent summit attempts. While browsing the displays, look for the Carl Zeiss telescope presented by Adolf Hitler to the head of the Nepali Army.
Just beside the museum, near the spot where Tenzing Norgay was cremated, stands the Tenzing Statue. The intrepid Everest summiteer lived in Darjeeling for most of his life and was the director of the institute for many years.
The HMI runs 28-day basic and advanced mountaineering courses (HMI;

Visitors are welcome to wander through the workshops. The handicrafts are for sale in the showroom and proceeds go straight back into the Tibetan community.
The quickest way to reach the centre is to walk steeply downhill from the north side of Bhanu Bhakta Sarani; take the alley down beside Hotel Dolphin. To return to Chowrasta Sq, take a side path 10 minutes to the Bhutia Busty Gompa and climb back uphill from there. A chartered taxi via North Point costs around ₹400/600 one way/return.

If you’re travelling on the toy train, or walking back from Tiger Hill, look out for this famous railway loop that goes around the open-air Gorkha War Memorial, erected in honour of the brave soldiers from the region who laid down their lives in WWI and WWII. Some tours stop here after the sunrise tripto Tiger Hill. The views are almost as good and the atmosphere much more serene.
Ghum
MONASTERIES
 
The junction of Ghum, 7km southwest from Darjeeling, is home to a number of colourful Buddhist monasteries. Yiga Choling Gompa, the region’s most famous monastery, has wonderful old murals and is home to some 30 monks of the Gelugpa school. Built in 1850, it enshrines a 5m-high statue of Jampa (Maitreya or ‘Future Buddha’) and 300 beautifully bound Tibetan texts. It’s just west of Ghum, about a 10-minute walk off Hill Cart Rd.
Other gompas of interest nearby include the fortress-style Guru Sakya Gompa, which conducts prayer sessions between 5.30am and 7.30am (useful if returning from a dawn visit to Tiger Hill). The active Samten Choling Gompa, just downhill, has the largest Buddha statue in West Bengal, a memorial chorten dedicated to German mystic Lama Govinda and a small cafe selling piping hot veg momos (₹20). All three gompas are within 10 minutes’ walk of each other on Hill Cart Rd.
About halfway between Ghum and Darjeeling is the huge Druk Sangak Choling Gompa, also known as Dali Gompa, inaugurated by the Dalai Lama in 1993. Known for its vibrant frescoes, it is home to 300 Himalayan monks who study philosophy, literature, astronomy, meditation, dance and music. Come for prayers between 4pm and 6pm.

HINDU TEMPLE

Darjeeling's most conspicuous Hindu temple is a replica of the famous Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu. It’s easy to find – just below the Darjeeling train station. There’s a good view over Darjeeling from its grounds.
SEEING THE SIGHTS IN DARJEELING
Darjeeling's sights are quite spread out and road transport is a bit of a hassle. You'll make things easier by visiting certain sights together as clusters.
One excellent idea is to jump out of bed at 4am and take a jeep up to Tiger Hill in time for the spectacular sunrise over Khangchendzonga. After a regulation photo op with the mountain in the backdrop, continue down to Ghum and spend the morning/day visiting Batasia Loop and the monasteries there. Next drive, walk or take a toy train back to Darjeeling along the quiet Tenzing Norgay Rd, via the monastery of Alu Bari (1½ hours). Despite the lack of mountain views, this also makes a nice cycling route.
If you can't face a dawn trip to Tiger Hill, an early-morning stroll around Bhanu Bhakta Sarani, which runs from Chowrasta around the north side of Observatory Hill, offers several stunning viewpoints. Combine the stroll with a visit down to Bhutia Busty Monastery or up to Observatory Hill.
A good half-day itinerary is to walk out to the zoo and Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, then continue around the hill on the road above busy Hill Cart Rd to the Rangit Valley Ropeway. From here take a shared minivan from North Point back to Darjeeling, getting off at Happy Valley Tea Estate. Then walk the short-cut footpath to Chowk Bazaar jeep stand via Lloyd's Botanical Garden. Alternatively, walk 30 minutes from the ropeway along Lebong Cart Rd to the Tibetan Refugee Self-Help Centre and hike back steeply uphill to Chowrasta via Bhutia Busty Monastery.

 )
From Chowrasta, children can take a ride around Observatory Hill for ₹200, or through tea estates to visit a monastery for ₹500 per hour. A horseman accompanies the horse at all times, and the activity is fairly safe. No riding helmets are provided though.TEA TOURISM
Darjeeling's most famous export is its aromatic muscatel tea, known for its amber colour, tannic astringence and a musky and spicy flavour. These days, however, sundry other teas including green, oolong and premium white varieties are produced alongside the traditional black tea. Most of the produce is now organic, and the best grades fetch several hundred dollars per kilo at auctions.
While in Darjeeling, a pot of this fine brew is best enjoyed at Sunset Lounge and House of Tea. The true-blue afternoon-tea experience at Windamere Hotel ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ; ₹450; h4-6pm) is a joy for aficionados of all things colonial, with
shortcake, scones, cheese and pickle sandwiches, and brews from the reputed Castleton Tea Estate.
For a more absorbing and enlightening experience, we recommend a day visit to one of the tea estates that currently welcomes visitors. The easiest places to learn about tea production are Makaibari Estate in Kurseong and Happy Valley outside Darjeeling. Spring, monsoon and autumn are the busiest times, when the three respective 'flushes' are harvested. There’s no plucking on Sunday, which means most of the machinery isn’t working on Monday.
If you wish to spend a night amid the plantations, try a tea pickers' family at a homestay (%033-22878560; Makaibari Tea Estate; per person incl full board US$25) at Makaibari Estate, where you’ll get to join your hosts for a morning’s work in the tea bushes. Pick your own leaves, watch them being processed and then return home with a batch of your very own hand-plucked Darjeeling tea. If you're in the mood for splurging, accommodation doesn’t get any more exclusive than top-end Glenburn (%9830070213; www.glenburnteaestate.com; Darjeeling; s/d incl full board ₹19,900/31,500), between Darjeeling and Kalimpong, a working tea estate/resort that boasts five members of staff for every guest. A stay at Glenburn is rumoured to have given director Wes Anderson inspiration for his film The Darjeeling Limited.

This Beatles-themed hotel is a must for fans.

The hotel is chock-a-block with Beatles memorabilia, including Beatles movies on the in-house TV channel.
The downstairs restaurant serves good fresh-ground coffee (₹120) and interesting Naga set meals (₹180). It’s certainly well thought-out, but there's a certain coldness to the hospitality that's dispensed by the proprietors. The entrance is easily missed behind the Union Church.

 ), known affectionately as
the toy train, is one of the few hill railways still operating in India. The panting train made its first journey along its precipice-topping, 2ft-wide tracks in September 1881. These days, it passes within feet of local storefronts as it weaves in and out of the main road, bringing traffic to a standstill and tooting its whistle incessantly for almost the entire trip. The train has been a Unesco World Heritage Site since 1999.
Services on the line have been in flux since 2009, when landslides destroyed a section of the track near Tindharia village. Services to and from NJP station are not expected to resume at least until 2016, which leaves only two daily diesel services to/from Kurseong via Ghum: Train No Darjeeling Ghum Kurseong

BORDER CROSSING – NEPAL FROM DARJEELING
Foreigners can only cross the border into Nepal at Kakarbhitta/Panitanki (not at Pasupati, en route to Mirik).
Samsara Tours, Travels & Treks can book day and night buses from Kakarbhitta to Kathmandu (₹1000 to ₹1200, departure 4am and 4pm), leaving you to hire a jeep to Kakarbhitta or catch a shared jeep to Siliguri and then Karkabhittha. Samsara can also book Nepali domestic flights from Bhadrapur to Kathmandu (US$130), which will save you the overnight bus trip.
Any tickets you see advertised from Darjeeling to Kathmandu are not direct buses and involve transfers in Siliguri and at the border – leaving plenty of room for problems – it’s just as easy to do it yourself.
TRAIN
The nearest major train station is at New Jalpaiguri (NJP), near Siliguri. Tickets can be bought for major services out of NJP at the Darjeeling Train Station (

Sun). Fares from Darjeeling include Ghum (1st/2nd class ₹140/20, 30 minutes) and Kurseong (1st/2nd class ₹210/30, three hours).
8 Getting Around There are several taxi stands around town, but rates are absurdly high for short hops. Darjeeling’s streets can be steep and hard to navigate. You can hire a porter to carry your bags up to Chowrasta Sq from Chowk Bazaar for around ₹100.
Share minivans to anywhere north of the town centre (eg to North Point) leave from the northern end of the Chowk Bazaar Bus & Jeep Station. For Ghum, get a share jeep (₹20) from along Hill Cart Rd.
Singalila Ridge Trek
The most popular multiday walk from Darjeeling is the five-day Singalila Ridge Trek from Mane Bhanjhang to Phalut, through the scenic Singalila NationalPark (Indian/foreigner ₹100/200, camera/video ₹100/500). The highlights are the great
views of the Himalayan chain stretching from Nepal to Sikkim and Bhutan. Sandakphu in particular offers a superb panorama that includes Lhotse, Everest and Khangchendzonga peaks. October and November’s clear skies and warm daytime temperatures make it an ideal time to trek, as do the long days and incredible rhododendron blooms of late April and May.
Local guides (₹800 per day) are mandatory within the park and must be arranged at the office of the Highlander Trekking Guides Association
(%9734056944; www.highlanderguidesandporters.com; Mane Bhanjang) at Mane Bhanjhang,
along with porters (₹400) if required.
Mane Bhanjhang is 26km from Darjeeling and is served by frequent shared jeeps (₹90, 1½ hours) as well as a 7am bus from Darjeeling’s Chowk Bazaar bus and jeep station. A chartered jeep costs ₹1200. From Rimbik, there are shared jeeps back to Darjeeling (₹120, five hours) at 7am and noon, and a bus at
6.30am (₹90). Book seats in advance.
If you have to overnight in Rimbik the best lodges are Hotel Sherpa (Rimbik; d ₹900), with pleasant lawns and Alpine-style huts, and Green Hill (Rimbik; dm ₹200, r ₹500), with quieter wooden rooms out back.
The usual trekking itinerary is 83km over five days. A shorter four-day option is possible by descending from Sandakphu to Sri Khola on day three. A rough jeep road follows the trek from Mane Bhanjhang to Phalut but traffic is very light and the walking trail partly avoids the road.
Private lodges, some with attached bathrooms, are available along the route for around ₹200 for a dorm bed or ₹400 to ₹700 per room. All offer food, normally a filling combo of rice, dhal and vegetables (₹200). Rooms have clean bedding and blankets so sleeping bags are not strictly necessary, though they are nice to have. At a minimum, bring a sleeping bag liner and warm clothes for dawn peak viewing. Bottled and boiled water is available along the route. Trekkers’ huts can be booked at the GTA Tourist Reception Centre, but even staff there will tell you that you are better off at one of the private lodges. The main lodges for each overnight stop are listed below in ascending order of price and quality: Day 1 Trekkers’ Hut, Mountain Lodge, Siddharta Lodge and Shikhar Lodge in Tumling; Trekkers’ Hut in Tonglu Day 2 Chewang Lodge inKalipokhari
Day 3 Trekkers’ Hut, Namobuddha, Sunrise and Sherpa Chalet Lodge in Sandakphu Day 4 Trekkers’ Hut and Forest Rest House in Phalut Day 5 Trekkers’ Hut, Namobuddha Lodge and Sherpa Lodge in Rammam All-inclusive guided treks on this route are offered by Darjeeling agencies for about ₹3000 per person per day, though it’s easy enough to arrange a DIY trek for less. Lodges can get booked out in the busy month of October, so consider a November itinerary if you're planning the trek in autumn.
Remember to bring your passport, as you’ll have to register at half a dozen army checkpoints. The ridge forms the India–Nepal border and the trail actually enters Nepal in several places.
For a relaxing end to a trek, consider a stay at Karmi Farm (www.karmifarm.com; per person incl full board ₹2000), a two-hour drive from Rimbik near Bijanbari. It’s managed by Andrew Pulger-Frame, whose Sikkimese grandparents once ran an estate from the main house here. The simple but comfortable rooms are attractively decorated with colourful local fabrics, and bathrooms have 24-hour hot water. A small clinic for villagers is run from the farm, providing a volunteer opportunity for medical students and doctors. Singalila treks and other activities can be organised, but it is just as easy to sit here for a week with a book and a pot of tea, overlooking the bird-and flower-filled gardens in the foreground and towering peaks in the distance. The adventurous could walk here in a day from Darjeeling, via North Point, Singtom Tea Estate and Pul Bazaar.Kalimpong
%03552 Pop 43,000 Elev 1250m
This bustling bazaar town sprawls along a saddle-shaped mountain ridge overlooking the roaring Teesta River and lorded over by the summit of Khangchendzonga. It’s not a must-see, but it does boast Himalayan views, Buddhist monasteries, colonial-era architecture and a fascinating nursery industry, all linked by some fine hikes.
Kalimpong’s early development as a major Himalayan trading centre focused on the tea trade with Tibet, across the Jelep La. Like Darjeeling, Kalimpong once belonged to the chogyals of Sikkim, but it fell into the hands of the Bhutanese in the 18th century and later passed to the British, before becoming part of India at Independence. Scottish missionaries, particularly the Jesuits, made great efforts to win over the local Buddhists in the late 19th century andmade great efforts to win over the local Buddhists in the late 19th century and the town remains an important educational centre for the entire eastern Himalaya.
Kalimpong is centred on its chaotic central market and Motor Stand. Most sights and quality accommodation are a kilometre or two from town, along DB Giri and Rinkingpong Rds.Kalimpong

Durpin Gompa

MONASTERY
Kalimpong’s largest monastery, formally known as Zangtok Pelri Phodang, sits atop panoramic Durpin Hill (1372m) and was consecrated by the Dalai Lama in 1976. There are impressive religious murals in the main prayer room downstairs (photography is permitted), interesting 3D mandalas (visual meditational aids) on the 2nd floor, and stunning Khangchendzonga views from the terrace. Prayers are held at 4pm.
The monastery is located about 5km south of the town centre, and is most easily reached by taxi (one-way ₹250). It's a pleasant downhill walk back to town, passing the army golf course. Stop for a drink at charming Morgan House, now a WBTDC hotel. A viewpoint about 300m below the gompa looks north towards the Jelep La and south over the Relli and Teesta Rivers.

There’s a museum that commemorates Graham and his wife, Katherine. The 1925 chapel above the school seems lifted straight out of a Scottish parish, with its grey slate, spire and fine stained-glass windows.
The gate is 4km up the steep KD Pradhan Rd. Many people charter a taxi to get here (₹200) and then do the downhill walk back to town via Tharpa CholingGompa and the Himalayan Handmade Paper Industry workshop.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
KALIMPONG WALKS
There’s plenty of scope for some great walking around Kalimpong, so allow an extra day or two to stretch the legs. Helpdesk at Sherpa Lodge and Holumba Haven offer information on all these walks and can arrange guides and transport if needed.
In Kalimpong itself, Helpdesk can arrange a guided crafts walk, taking in a traditional incense workshop, working silversmiths, noodle makers and a thangka (Tibetan cloth painting) studio, all hidden in the backstreet bazaars.
One good half-day walk close to town leads from near Holumba Haven to the villages of Challisey and Chibo Busty to a grand viewpoint over the Teesta River. En route, you can drop by the LK Pradhan Cactus Nursery and a small curd production centre at Tharker Farm, with the option of descending to see two fascinating traditional Lepcha houses at Ngassey village.
Heading further afield, one potential DIY hike starts at a wide track 2km past Algarah on the road to Pelling. The track climbs gently along a forested ridge to the faint 17th- century ruins of Damsang Dzong, site of the last stand of the Lepcha kings against the Bhutanese. Continue along the ridge and then descend to views of Khangchendzonga at Tinchuli Hill, before following the dirt road back to the main Algarah–Pedong road. From here you can walk back 4km to Algarah to catch a shared jeep to Kalimpong, or continue 3km to Pedong via the Shangchen Dorje Gompa in Sakyong Busty. You can get a shared jeep from Kalimpong to Pedong (₹50) or Algarah (₹30). If you want to stay overnight, try the Silk Route Retreat (%9932828753; www.thesilkrouteretreat.com; 21st Mile, Pedong; r/cottage ₹900/1700) in Pedong.
For the ultimate dawn and dusk views of Khangchendzonga, head to the Tiffin Dara viewpoint, just above the village of Rishap, about 30km from Kalimpong. A rough road climbs from the main Kalimpong–Lava road for 3km to a signed footpath 1km before Rishap. The path detours left after 20 minutes to the viewpoint and then continues through forest for 45 minutes to rejoin the main Lava–Kalimpong road. Just before this junction, by some prayer flags, a shortcut footpath drops down to Lava village via the Forest Lodge. For transport take the 7am shared jeep to Lava or the slower 8am bus. A chartered one-way jeep costs ₹1600 to Rishap or ₹2000 for a day's return hire, taking in Lava.
Lava (2353m) is a worthy destination in itself, especially if you time your walk with the bustling Tuesday market, or the 10am debating or 3.30pm prayers at the modern Kagyupa Thekchenling Gompa. Adjoining Lava is Neora Valley National Park (Indian/foreigner ₹100/200, vehicle entry ₹100, guide ₹600; h15 Sep-15 Jun), whose lush forests are home to red pandas, clouded leopards and myriad bird species. Travel agents can arrange a four-day camping trek to Roche La (3155m), at the high junction of West Bengal, Sikkim and Bhutan. The cottages of the Lava Forest Lodge (%033-23350064;www.wbfdc.com; Lava; d from ₹800) just above town offer the nicest accommodation but can be hard to book; try through WBTDC in Siliguri (03552-255654; www.wbtdc.gov.in) or Holumba Haven in Kalimpong. The private Hotel Orchid (%03552-282213; Lava; d from ₹1100) is another decent choice. Avoid October, when Bengali tourists flood the town. Shared jeeps (₹100) run back to Kalimpong when full, until around 3.30pm.

Why Go?
Glistening paddy-fields to the north and wild forested hills to the south provide a striking backdrop for a visit to this remote rural region This is also one of thestriking backdrop for a visit to this remote rural region. This is also one of the country's religious melting pots, and getting caught up in the spiritual atmosphere is the real draw for travellers.
Bihar is the birthplace of Buddhism and plays host to thousands of pilgrims from around the world who throng its many places of religious significance; the most extraordinary of which is traveller-friendly Bodhgaya, where Buddha achieved enlightenment. In tribal Jharkhand, holy Parasnath Hill is a revered Jain pilgrimage site, and joining devotees on the hike to the top is a surreal highlight for those who like to get off the beaten track.
Truth be told, the whole of this region is off the beaten track. Outside Bodhgaya, foreign tourists are almost nonexistent, so if you're looking to sidestep mainstream travel, this unfashionable pocket of India could be an unexpected highlight.
When to Go
A Jan & Feb Temperatures hover between a chilly-to-pleasant 12°C and 25°C. A Jun–Sep Monsoon season. Steer clear – Bihar is India’s most flood-prone state.
A Oct & Nov Comfortably cool again; the region's forests assume a moody autumn look.Best for Spiritual Atmosphere

History Bihar's ancient history kicks off with the arrival of Prince Siddhartha during the 6th century BC, who spent many years here before leaving, enlightened, as the Buddha. Mahavira, a contemporary of Buddha and the founder of Jainism, was born in Bihar and attained nirvana near Nalanda at the age of 72. In the 4th century BC, after Chandragupta Maurya conquered the Magadha kingdom and its capital Pataliputra (now Patna), he expanded into the Indus Valley and created the first great Indian empire. His grandson and successor, Ashoka, ruled the Mauryan empire from Pataliputra, which was one of the largest cities in the world at that time. Emperor Ashoka embraced Buddhism, erecting stupas, monuments and his famous Ashokan pillars throughout northern India, notably at Sarnath (Uttar Pradesh) and Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh). In Bihar, Ashoka built the original shrine on the site of
today’s Mahabodhi Temple in Bodhgaya and the lion- topped pillar at Vaishali.
Bihar continued to be coveted by a succession of major empires until the Magadha dynasty rose to glory again during the reign of the Guptas (7th and 8th centuries AD). With the decline of the Mughal empire in the 17th century AD, Bihar came under the control of Bengal until 1912, when a separate state was formed. Part of this state later became Orissa (Odisha) and, more recently in 2000, Jharkhand.8 Information Bihar and Jharkhand have a reputation for lawlessness. Conditions have improved in recent times, but bandit activity – such as holding up cars, buses and trains – is still a possibility, albeit a remote one. Although tourists are not specific targets, it’s a good idea to keep up to date with the latest info; check the newspapers Bihar Times (www.bihartimes.in) or Patna Daily (www.patnadaily.com), or the English portal of Ranchi Express (www.ranchiexpress.com) before arrival.
BIHAR
Most people travel to Bihar to visit the hallowed Buddhist circuit of Bodhgaya, Rajgir, Nalanda and Vaishali, with Patna as a transport hub, but there are also a few quirky destinations to get your adventure juices flowing.
TOP FESTIVALS
Pataliputra Mahotsava (Patna; hMar) A celebration of Patna's historic past with parades, sports, dancing and music.
Rajgir Mahotsava A performing-arts gala with dances, devotional songs and instrumental music.
Chhath Festival (Bihar and Jharkhand) People perform spectacular rituals on the banks of rivers and water bodies to honour Surya, the Sun God.

Patna

Bihar’s busy capital sprawls out over the south bank of the Ganges, just east of the river’s confluence with three major tributaries. There’s nothing for the traveller along the river itself, and Patna only has a handful of worthwhile sights. Otherwise, it’s a chaotic, congested city that's used mostly as a transport hub, or as a base for day trips to sights in northern Bihar.as a base for day trips to sights in northern Bihar.
Patna was once a powerful city. Early in the 5th century BC, Ajatasatru shifted the capital of his Magadha kingdom from Rajgir to Pataliputra (Patna), fulfilling Buddha’s prophecy that a great city would arise here. Emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka also called Pataliputra home, and it remained one of India’s most important cities for almost 1000 years.
Patna stretches along the southern bank of the Ganges for about 15km. The 5.7km-long Mahatma Gandhi Setu, one of the longest river bridges in the world, connects Patna with northern Bihar.Patna1 Top Sights 1GolgharC1

For a dome with a view, climb this massive, bulbous granary, built by the British army in 1786. The idea behind its construction was to avoid a repeat of the 1770 famine – look for the old carved sign on one side, reading: 'For the perpetual prevention of famine in these provinces' – although fortunately it was never required.
Its dual spiralling staircases (142 steps each) were designed so that workers could climb up one side and down the other. The viewing gallery on top of the monument affords unparalleled vistas of the city and the Ganges.

MITHILA (MADHUBANI) PAINTINGSBihar’s unique and most famous folk art is its Mithila (Madhubani) paintings, produced by women from the Maithili tribe. Traditionally, women from Madhubani and surrounding villages started to create line drawings on the walls of their homes from the first day of their marriage. Using pigments from spices, minerals, charcoal and vegetable matter, they painted local deities and scenes from mythology, often intermingled with special events and aspects of everyday life.
These paintings, in both black-and-white and strong primary colours, are now professionally produced on paper, canvas and silk, and marketed for sale. Original wall paintings can still be seen in homes around Madhubani, 160km northeast of Patna.

Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. The IndiGo flight to Mumbai goes via Lucknow.
BUS
The main bus stand occupies a large, dusty space about 1.5km from the train station (₹5 shared autos run here from the back of the train station). It's a hugely hectic place, but if you walk into the chaos telling people where you want to go, you'll soon get shown to the right bus; buy tickets on board.
There are frequent services throughout the day, and some sleeper buses to Ranchi and Raxaul. Destinations include the following: A Gaya ₹100, three hours A Kesariya ₹100, three hours A Motihari ₹145, 4½ hours A Ranchi AC/non-AC ₹350/280, eight hours A Raxaul AC/non-AC ₹230/180, eight hours A Vaishali ₹60, two hours

GOOGLE MAP
 ; window 3,
Patna Junction; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun) at the 1st-floor reservation office, in the
right-hand wing of the station.
Trains leave roughly hourly for Gaya (2nd class/AC chair ₹25/290, two to three hours) between 5am and 11.30pm. Just buy a 2nd-class 'general' ticket and hop on the next available service.
More than a dozen daily trains leave for New Delhi (sleeper/3AC/2AC
₹500/1260/1825, 12 to 18 hours); the quickest and most convenient time-wise, isthe RJPB Rajdhani (3AC/2AC/1AC ₹1610/2235/3730) which leaves at 7.25pm and arrives in Delhi at 7.40am.
Ten daily trains go to Kolkata (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹340/880/1240, eight to 14 hours). The best time-wise is probably the Vibhuti Express (10.35pm, nine hours).
At least 20 daily trains go to Varanasi (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹160/485/690, four to six hours) between 5am and 11pm.

Around Patna
Vaishali
%06225
A quiet, yet significant Buddhist pilgrimage site, Vaishali, 55km northwest of Patna, makes a lovely rural escape from hectic Patna. The small museum is engaging, while the ruins of Kolhua are wonderfully serene. And simply walking around the surrounding villages and farmland is a treat in itself.
The bus will drop you at the so-called 'high school', from where it's a 1km walk along a straight lane to a large ancient coronation water tank. On the left side of the tank is the modern, whitewashed, Japanese-built World Peace Pagoda (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; hdawn-dusk). On the opposite side of the tank, and of more interest, is the Buddha Relic Stupa (hdawn-dusk) and the
Archaeological Museum (admission ₹10; h9am-5pm Mon-Sat). The 5th-centurystupa, once 12m tall, is now in ruins, but it was once one of the eight locations in which Buddha's ashes were buried, after he had been cremated at Kushinagar. The ashes now reside in Patna Museum. The small archaeological museum here contains 2000-year-old clay and terracotta figures, 1000-year-old Buddhist statuary, and an intriguing 1st-to 2nd-century AD toilet pan. It also has an interesting scale model of the nearby site of Kolhua.
Between the Buddha Stupa Relic and the Archaeological Museum, a single- lane countryside road winds its way through farming villages to the Kolhua Complex (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h7am-5pm), 5km away. It's worth making time for this very pleasant walk, although shared autos also make the trip and it's relatively easy to hitch a ride on a motorbike. Set in a landscaped park, Kolhua comprises a large, hemispherical brick stupa guarded by a lion squatting atop a 2300-year-old Ashoka pillar. The pillar is plain and contains none of the Ashokan edicts usually carved onto these pillars. Nearby are the ruins of smaller stupas and monastic buildings. According to legend, Buddha was given a bowl of honey here by monkeys, who also dug out a rainwater tank for his water supply.
The best place to grab lunch in Vaishali is the Buddha Fun & Food Village (mains ₹65-200), located at one corner of the ceremonial tank. There's outdoor seating and a children's play area.
The last bus back to Patna swings by the main road at around 4pm.
WORTH A TRIP
KESARIYA
Rising high out of the earth from where the dying Buddha donated his begging bowl, the enormous Kesariya Stupa (hdawn-dusk) is an enthralling example of how nature can reclaim a deserted monument. Excavated from under a grassy and wooded veil is what is thought to be the world’s tallest (38m) Buddhist stupa dating from the Pala period (200– 750 AD). Above the 425m-circumference pedestal are five uniquely shaped terraces that form a gargantuan Buddhist tantric mandala. Each terrace has a number of niches containing disfigured Buddha statues, which were destroyed during attacks by foreign invaders in the middle ages. The rural setting is a joy, but there is nothing else to see here apart from the stupa.
Buses from Patna can drop you by the stupa, which is visible from the main road. The last bus back swings by at around 3.30pm. Buses from Motihari will drop you at the maincrossroads in the village of Kesariya, where there are roadside dhabas (snack bars) you could have lunch in, leaving you with a 2km-walk (the signpost says 3km but it's not that far).
Raxaul
%06255 / Pop 41,600
Raxaul is a dusty, congested border town that provides passage into Nepal via a hassle-free border post. It's no place to linger, but if you must spend the night,
Hotel Kaveri (%06255-221148; Main Rd; with/without AC ₹1000/300; a), on the main
road leading to the border (about 1km from the border), has decent air-con rooms with modern bathrooms, and very basic non-air-conditioned rooms with tap-and-bucket showers, but shared toilets. Restaurants are scarce and none have English menus; the dhaba (snack bar) opposite Hotel Kaveri is probably your best bet.
The bus stand is 200m down a lane off the main road, about 2km from the border on the right. There are frequent buses, day and night, to Patna (AC/non- AC ₹230/180, seven to eight hours) via Motihari (₹60/50, 2½ hours). The road to Motihari is dreadfully bumpy so sit near the front of the bus if you can.
The train station is off the main road, 750m from the border, but isn't well connected. The Mithila Express runs daily to Kolkata (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹365/990/1425, 18 hours, 10am). The Satyagrah Express runs daily to New Delhi (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹455/1215/1765, 24 hours, 9.05am).
BORDER CROSSING – NEPAL FROM RAXAUL
Border Hours
The border at Raxaul is open from 6am to 10pm.
Foreign Exchange
No banks change money in Raxaul but there are many private money changers on bothsides of the border. The State Bank of India (h10.30am-4.30pm Mon-Fri, to 1.30pm Sat), on the main road in Raxaul, has an ATM.
Onward Transport
On the Nepal side, the town of Birganj is about 3km from the border. You are free to walk across the border to Birganj, or shared autorickshaws and tongas (two-wheeled horse carriages) charge ₹20 per person from the border to Birganj. A cycle-rickshaw costs about ₹100.
From Birganj, there are frequent buses to Kathmandu (ordinary/deluxe/AC
₹550/600/800, six to seven hours, 5am to 8pm). However, the most comfortable and quickest option is to get a Tata Sumo ‘4WD’ (₹550 to ₹800, four to five hours, every 20 minutes until 5pm). There are also morning buses to Pokhara (₹600, eight hours) via Narayangarh (₹250, four hours) at 5am, 6.30am and 7.30am.
Buddha Air has up to five daily flights between Simara (the airport for Birganj) and Kathmandu (US$100, 20 minutes). The airport is 22km from Birganj and a taxi costs around ₹1000.
Visas
Nepali 15-, 30-and 90-day visas (US$25/40/100 and one passport photo) are only available from 6am to 6pm on the Nepal side of the border.
Gaya
%0631 / Pop 395,000
The hectic town of Gaya is a religious centre for Hindu pilgrims. They believe that the temple offerings here relieve the recently departed from the cycle of birth and rebirth. For foreign tourists, it merely serves as a transit point for Bodhgaya, 13km away.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
GEORGE ORWELL MUSEUM
Not only will a trip to Motihari break the long bus ride between Patna and the Nepal border, it will also allow you to become one of the first-ever tourists to visit the world's first George Orwell Museum. The museum was still being built when we visited, on the site of the dilapidated family cottage in which Orwell was born. It was due to open in 2015 and will be the world's only museum dedicated to the celebrated British novelist.
Eric Arthur Blair (George Orwell was a pen name), was born here in 1903. His father, Richard W Blair, worked for the opium department, supervising poppy growers and collecting opium for export to China. The grounds of their family home, which will be landscaped into a small park, also contain the crumbling remains of one of his father's opium warehouses.
Motihari is part of a region from where, in 1917, Mahatma Gandhi launched the civil disobedience movement that ultimately resulted, 30 years later, in the departure of the British from India. Gandhi had been moved by the plight of cultivators in Bihar who were being forced to produce opium and indigo for the lucrative markets of China and Europe respectively. There is also a small Gandhi Museum in town.
The Orwell Museum is a 2.5km walk northwest of the bus stand (₹30 in a cycle- rickshaw; ask for Gyan Babu Chowk). Walk back up to the main road that your bus came in on, passing the cinema on your left. Walk over the crossroads (known as Chhatauni Chowk), and continue straight along Bagaha Dhala Rd, past the Gandhi statue and Hotel Puja and on to Gyan Babu Chowk. Here, just as the road starts bearing round to the left, take the straightest of the three right forks, and the museum will be on your left after 200m. If you reach the veterinary clinic you've walked 100m too far.
Hotel Puja (%8521731700; Bagaha Dhala Rd; with/without AC ₹2000/700; a) has large colourful rooms. There are plenty of restaurants nearby. From Motihari, there are frequent buses to Patna (₹145 4½ hours), Raxaul (₹50, 2½ hours) and Kesaria (₹40, two hours), from where you can catch passing buses to Vaishali.
Bodhgaya
%0631 / Pop 30,900
The crucible of Buddhism, Bodhgaya was where Prince Siddhartha attained enlightenment beneath a bodhi tree and became Buddha 2600 years ago. In terms of blessedness, this tiny temple town is to Buddhists what Mecca is to
M   li      U          i i   l   i               h         d    f  il   i     f                d  h        ldMuslims. Unsurprisingly, it attracts thousands of pilgrims from around the world every year, who come for prayer, study and meditation.
The most hallowed spot in town is a bodhi tree which flourishes inside the Mahabodhi Temple complex, amid a beautiful garden setting, its roots embedded in the same soil as its celebrated ancestor. Additionally, many monasteries and temples dot the bucolic landscape, built in their national style by foreign Buddhist communities. The ambience is a mix of monastic tranquillity and small-town commotion (a booming nonreligious tourism industry has brought along with it the usual invasion of tourist paraphernalia, souvenir stalls and English-speaking wannabe guides).
The best time to visit is November to March when Tibetan pilgrims come down from McLeod Ganj in Dharamsala. The high season is from December to January, which is also when the Dalai Lama often visits.Bodhgaya

The magnificent Unesco World Heritage–listed Mahabodhi Temple, marking the hallowed ground where Buddha attained enlightenment and formulated his philosophy of life, forms the spiritual heart of Bodhgaya. Built in the 6th century AD atop the site of a temple erected by Emperor Ashoka almost 800 years earlier, it was razed by foreign invaders in the 11th century, and subsequently underwent several major restorations.
Topped by a 50m pyramidal spire, the inner sanctum of the ornate structure houses a 10th-century, 2m-high gilded image of a seated Buddha. Amazingly, four of the original sculpted stone railings surrounding the temple, dating from the Sunga period (184–72 BC), have survived amid the replicas. Others are now housed inside the archaeological museum.
Pilgrims and visitors from all walks of life and religions come to worship or just soak up the atmosphere of this sacred place. There’s a well-manicured

the temple grounds. An enthralling way to start or finish the day is to stroll around the inside perimeter of the temple compound (in an auspicious clockwise pattern) and watch a sea of maroon and yellow dip and rise as monks perform endless prostrations on their prayer boards.Monasteries & Temples

TREE OF WISDOM
Undoubtedly, the most sacred fig tree ever to grace the Earth was the Bodhi Tree (
 ) at Bodhgaya, under which Prince Siddhartha, aka the Buddha, achieved enlightenment.
Known as Sri Maha Bodhi, the original tree was paid special attention by Ashoka, a mighty Indian emperor who ruled most of the subcontinent from 269 to 232 BC, a century or so after the date the Buddha is believed to have died. Ashoka's jealous wife, Tissarakkhā, felt the emperor should have been directing his devotion towards her, rather than towards a tree and, in a fit of rage, she caused the tree to perish by piercing it with poisonous thorns.
Thankfully, before its death, one of the tree’s saplings was carried off to Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka by Sanghamitta (Ashoka’s daughter), where it continues to flourish. A cutting was later carried back to Bodhgaya and planted where the original once stood. The red sandstone slab between the tree and the adjacent Mahabodhi Temple was placed by Ashoka to mark the spot of Buddha’s enlightenment – it’s referred to as the Vajrasan (Diamond Throne). Buddha was said to have stared unblinkingly at the tree in an awed gesture of gratitude and wonder after his enlightenment. Today, pilgrims and tourists alike flock here and attempt to do exactly the same thing, and the tree is considered the most important of Buddhism’s four holiest sites.

Rajgir
%06112 / Pop 33,700
The fascinating surrounds of Rajgir are bounded by five semiarid rocky hills, each lined with ancient stone walls – vestiges of the ancient capital of Magadha. As both Buddha and Mahavira spent some serious time here, Rajgir is an important pilgrimage site for Buddhists and Jains. And a mention in the Mahabharata also means that Rajgir sees a large number of Hindu pilgrims, who come to bathe in the hot springs at the Lakshmi Narayan Temple.
Rajgir is littered with historic sites, so bank on spending a couple of days here, including a side trip to Nalanda. It's a lovely part of Bihar; cooler and greener than other places in the region, and relatively hassle-free.
Rajgir Mahotsava (Rajgir; hOct), in October, is the town’s three-day cultural festival featuring classical Indian music, folk music and dance.
1 Sights & Activities The most pleasant way to seeRajgir’s scattered sites is to rent a tonga. A four-hour tour including the hot springs at Lakshmi Narayan Temple, Vishwashanti Stupa, the museum at Veerayatan and any number of other sights you have time for is ₹600, although you can usually barter the price down to ₹500. For single- trip journeys to popular sights, shared tonga rides are also possible (expect to pay about ₹10 per person for a 2km ride).
o Vishwashanti Stupa

Constructed in 1965, this blazing-white, 40m stupa stands atop the Ratnagiri Hill about 5km south of town. Recesses in the stupa feature golden statues of Buddha in four stages of his life – birth, enlightenment, preaching and death. A fun, but wobbly, single-person chairlift runs to the summit, which affords expansive views of hills and a few Jain shrines dotting the landscape.
Next to the stupa, a Japanese-built peace pagoda reverberates to the rhythmic sound of meditative drum beat. If you walk back down the hill, rather than taking the chairlift, you can detour to the ruined remains of a 1500-year-old stupa, thought to be where Buddha preached to his disciples.
Lakshmi Narayan Temple

Hindu pilgrims are drawn to the noisy Lakshmi Narayan Temple, about 2km south of town (turn right out of the bus stand and keep walking), to enjoy the health benefits of the hot springs here. The murky grey Brahmakund, the hottest spring, is a scalding 45°C.
Temple priests will show you around, pour hot water on your head (in the manner of bathing a pilgrim) and ask for generous donations (don't feel pressured into giving anything if you don't want to; there's no obligation). It’s a fascinating but confusing place with no English signs; tread carefully so you don’t unintentionally offend.Veerayatan

Nalanda

Founded in the 5th century AD, Nalanda – 15km north of Rajgir – was one of the ancient world’s great universities and an important Buddhist centre of academic excellence. When Chinese scholar and traveller Xuan Zang visited sometime between 685 and 762 AD, about 10,000 monks and students lived here, studying theology, astronomy, metaphysics, medicine and philosophy. It’s said that Nalanda’s three libraries were so extensive they burnt for six months when foreign invaders sacked the university in the 12th century.
Allow at least an hour or two for wandering the extensive ruins (Indian/foreigner
₹5/100, video camera ₹25; h9am-5.30pm). They’re peaceful and well maintained with a
park-like atmosphere of clipped lawns, shrubs and roses. The red-brick ruins consist of nine monasteries and four main temples. Most impressive is the Great Stupa, with steps, terraces, a few intact votive stupas and monks’ cells (sleeping quarters). Climbing the structures is not allowed.
Unofficial guides (₹100) will approach you, but each of the ruins have signboards beside them including explanatory text in English.
Across from the entrance to the ruins is the archaeological museum
(admission ₹5; h9am-5pm, closed Fri), a small but fascinating museum housing theNalanda University seal and a host of beautiful stone sculptures and bronzes unearthed from Nalanda and Rajgir. Among the many Buddha figures and kirtimukha (gargoyles) is a bizarre multiple-spouted pot (probably once used to contain perfumed water).
About 1.5km further on from the museum and the ruins (take the first right) is the huge Xuan Zang Memorial Hall (Indian/foreigner ₹5/50; h8am-5pm), built by the Chinese as a peace pagoda in honour of the famous Chinese traveller who walked to India from China before studying and teaching for some years at Nalanda, and eventually returning home with Buddhist scriptures he would later translate into Chinese. His epic trip was immortalised in Journey to the West, one of China's classic pieces of literature. The story was then turned into the cult 1970s TV show, Monkey. Modern-day backpackers will appreciate the statue of Xuan Zang at the front of the memorial hall.
On the pathway leading to the archaeological museum, Cafeteria Nalanda (mains ₹100-250; h6am-8pm) makes a pleasant spot for lunch. It does Indian and Chinese dishes and has tree-shaded outdoor seating.
Buses from Rajgir (₹10) drop you at Nalanda village. From there you can take a shared tonga (per person ₹5) for the final 2km to the ruins.
Kundalpur
About 1.5km beyond the Nalanda ruins (bear left, then right, then take the first right turn after Surya Kund pond), you’ll find the striking Nandyavarta Mahal (h5am-9pm) at Kundalpur, believed by the Digambar Jain sect to be the birthplace of Lord Mahavira, the final tirthankar and founder of Jainism. The small temple complex houses three hot-white temples, the main featuring a to- scale postured idol of Mahavira. Inside the serene Trikal Chaubeesi Jinmandir within the same complex you’ll find 72 tirthankar idols representing 24 each of the past age, the present age and the future age.
JHARKHAND
Hewn out of neighbouring Bihar in 2000 to meet the autonomy demands of the Adivasi (tribal) population, Jharkhand is a land of immense natural and anthropological wealth However despite boasting an incredible 40% of theanthropological wealth. However, despite boasting an incredible 40% of the country’s mineral wealth (mostly coal, copper and iron ore), rich forests and cash rich industrial hubs, it is plagued by poverty, social injustice, corruption and sporadic outbursts of Maoist and Naxalite violence. For travellers, Jharkhand’s prime attractions are the Jain pilgrimage centre at Parasnath Hill, its national parks and the chance to explore a relatively tourist-free and unspoilt part of India.
Ranchi
%0651 / Pop 863,500
Set on a plateau at 700m and marginally cooler than the plains, Jharkhand’s capital, Ranchi, was the summer capital of Bihar under the British. Apart from the Jagannath Temple, there’s little of interest here for travellers, but the city acts as a gateway to Betla (Palamau) National Park, and there are numerous waterfalls you can visit in the surrounding countryside.

Jagannath Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
 
This 17th-century temple, about 12km southwest of town (₹250 return by autorickshaw), is a smaller version of the great Jagannath Mandir at Puri, and is open to non-Hindus. Every year during the Rath Yatra festival, in the same manner as in Puri in Odisha, Jagannath and his brother and sister gods are charioted to their holiday home, a smaller temple some 500m away.

z Festivals & Events
Chhath Festival
HINDU FESTIVAL
(Bihar & Jharkhand; hOct/Nov)
People line the banks of rivers and water bodies to honour Surya, the Sun God. For four days every November, it sees pious locals perform a series of rites that culminate in a social jamboree on the third day, marked by water rituals, traditional music and social mingling.
At sunset on the sixth day after Diwali, married women, having fasted for 36 hours, immerse themselves in the water and offer fruits and flowers to the deity.
4 Sleeping Station Rd, running between the train and bus stations, is lined with hotels and restaurants, but most budget hotels do not have permits for hosting foreigners. Turn left out of the train station to reach Chanakya BNR Hotel (100m), the Nook, and Suhana Tour & Travels (200m), Hotel AVN Plaza (300m) and the government bus stand (500m), just beyond the junction where shared autorickshaws pick up passengers.

GUESTHOUSE
(%06612-2462925; Railway Station; dm ₹150-200, s ₹500-550, tw ₹700-750, with AC s/d ₹1000/1280)
Surprisingly good for a train-station rest house, and the only budget hotel around here that will accept foreigners, Yatri Niwas has simple but comfortable rooms with TV and clean bathrooms. Rooms facing the outside of the building cost ₹50 more than their station-facing counterparts, but are quieter and have more natural light.Turn right out of the train station to find the entrance.

This neat, modern hotel has small but spotlessly clean rooms with TV, wi-fi and hot-water showers. There are only five standard rooms (₹1000 for a double), so call ahead to reserve one unless you want to pay for premium (₹1800 for a double). It's down a lane, off Station Rd, but signposted. It has 24-hour checkout.
o Chanakya BNR Hotel
HERITAGE HOTEL
(%06612-2461211; www.chanakyabnrranchi.com; Station Rd; s/d incl breakfast from ₹4500/5700;

This charming hotel could be your sole reason for visiting Ranchi. A part- historic railways property located outside the train station, it's a superbly renovated terracotta-roofed Raj relic that oozes vintage and boutique appeal. The property's trees are home to parrots, and it has a small outdoor pool, two excellent restaurants and a bar.
While the deluxe rooms are luxurious enough, try and grab a 110-year-old heritage room (same price), with antique furniture, plush beds, high ceilings and glass-panelled views of manicured lawns outside. You can't prebook the heritage rooms; just ask for one when you arrive and keep your fingers crossed.
5 Eating & Drinking Hotel AVN Plaza and Chanakya BNR Hotel both have restaurants that are open to nonguests; Chanakya BNR's two restaurants are particularly good.
Nook
(Station Rd; mains ₹90-150; hnoon-3pm & 7-11pm)
Arguably the best midrange hotel restaurant in the train-station area, this in- house dining facility at Hotel Kwality Inns is comfortable and the service attentive without being obsequious. The tandoori section is delightful and amazingly popular, and there’s chilled beer and hard booze on offer too.

The once-daily Tapaswini Express goes to Bhubaneswar (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹340/920/1325, 13 hours, 3.55pm).
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
HIKING THE HOLY HILLFor a fabulously off-beat experience with a spiritual leaning, consider joining the hundreds of Jain pilgrims who hike each morning to the top of holy Parasnath Hill.
Also known as Shikarji, Parasnath Hill is the highest mountain in Jharkhand, and a major Jain pilgrimage centre. It rises 1366m from the lush surrounding farmland in a secluded spot of eastern Jharkhand (although it's best reached from Gaya in Bihar) and its summit is studded with 31 temples of religious importance, including the striking Parasnath Temple which stands on the spot where 20 of the 24 Jain tirthankars (Jain teachers; including Parasnath, at the age of 100) are believed to have reached salvation.
The approach to the hill is from the small, but auspicious temple town of Madhuban, 13km northeast of Parasnath train station, and located at the foot of the mountain. The daily pilgrimage begins from the town at 3am or 4am; it’s a 9km hike to the top, followed by a 9km loop at the summit, visiting each of the temples. The entire 27km circuit – up, round and back down – takes about nine to 10 hours; three hours up, three or four hours circuiting the summit, and two hours back down. You could start later in the day and still get back before dark, but hiking while you're half asleep with hundreds of pilgrims as dawn breaks across the mountain is a big part of the experience here, and starting early means you avoid the worst of the midday heat. Water, chai and snacks are available along the way. During holidays and major festivals, you could end up walking with as many as 15,000 people.
You’re likely to spend at least one night in Madhuban. There are three or four hotels in town (plus numerous dharamsalas – pilgrims' rest houses). The best value is the ageing Yatri Nivas (%0658-232265; Madhuban; r ₹300-400) with simple, but huge rooms, some with mountain views. It's at the bottom end of the main road leading up to the mountain, just before you reach the museum; look for the easy-to-miss sign on the gate. Just before Yatri Nivas, turn left down a lane off the main road, and keep walking for 500m to reach Shikarji Continental (%06558-232429; Madhuban; r ₹1400; a). This is the best-quality hotel in town, with large, smart, air-con-cooled rooms; many have balconies with mountain views. It has a restaurant and a massage room (per hour ₹50); perfect after your hike. Hotel Sapna & Veg Restaurant (%06558-232234; Main Rd, Madhuban; r from ₹600; mains ₹50-130; h11am-10pm) is towards the top end of the main road and has a 1st-floor restaurant serving tasty South Indian and Punjabi dishes. While you're in Madhuban, it's worth popping into the small but well-kept Jain Museum (Madhuban; admission ₹5; h8am- 6.30pm Mar-Oct, 8.30am-6pm Nov-Feb), on your left at the bottom end of the main road.
There are frequent trains throughout the day running between Gaya and Parasnath (two hours). Just buy a 'general' 2nd-class ticket (₹65 to ₹80) and hop on the next train; you'll usually get a seat, and if not, it's only two hours. Shared vehicles (jeeps, autos and even the odd bus) wait for passengers to disembark at Parasnath station, then take them to Madhuban (per person ₹30).
From Parasnath there are also trains to Ranchi (2nd class/AC chair ₹110/370, four hours, 10.24am and 4.25pm) and Varanasi (2nd class/sleeper ₹130/255 six hours,
11.21am), and a handful of trains to Kolkata, the most convenient being the Doon Express (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹210/555/790, seven hours, 11.55pm).Betla (Palamau) National Park
%06562
Wild elephants freely roam the virgin forests of this lovely, rarely visited
national park (%06562-222650, 9939341211; h6-10am & 2-5pm), spread over the hilly
landscape of picturesque Palamau district, 140km west of Ranchi. Tiger sightings are rare, but a trip to this primeval region of Jharkhand offers a glimpse into the rich tribal heritage of the state. The park covers around 1026 sq km, about 232 sq km of which was declared as Betla National Park in 1989. Hiding behind stands of sal forest, rich evergreens, teak trees and bamboo thickets are some 17 tigers, 52 leopards, 216 elephants and four lonely nilgais (antelope) according to a 2007 census (newer figures are yet to be derived). You'll also see plenty of monkeys, spotted deer and possibly some gaur (Indian bison).
The park is open year-round, but the best time to visit is November to April. If you can stand the heat, May is prime time for tiger spotting as forest cover is reduced and animals venture out in search of waterholes.
Jeep safaris and elephant safaris can be arranged privately at the park gate. See the boxed text for a break down of the costs for jeep safaris.
Elephant safaris only last one hour but cost a flat-rate of ₹400 per elephant (up to four people), so are a bargain. as well as being a lot of fun; the elephant takes you off-piste, into thick forest cover, although not as deep into the park as the jeeps do.
Jeep safaris can be taken either during the park's morning session (between 6am and 10am) or afternoon session (between 2pm and 5pm), but elephant safaris can only be taken in the morning, and should be prebooked the night before (although this isn't always necessary). If you take a morning safari, wrap up warm; it's freezing in the forest before the sun comes up properly. If you don't have any warm clothes, borrow a blanket from your guesthouse to wrap yourself in.
If you have time on your hands, consider an excursion to the ruined Palamau Fort, a 16th-century citadel of the local tribal Chero dynasty sited spectacularly within the forest. Alternatively, plan a picnic on the sandy banks of the scenicKechki River. A jeep tour to the fort costs the same as a jeep safari. A jeep tour to Kechki River is the same, minus the ₹150 park entry fee.
4 Sleeping & Eating The best accommodation is Tourist Lodge (%bookings 06562-222650; d from ₹1130; a), just inside the entrance gate. It's far from luxurious, but boasts large clean rooms with TV, spacious bathrooms and private balconies with views of the deer-filled meadow in front of the forest. The well-priced canteen does post-safari breakfasts and arranges a hearty vegetarian thali (₹100) for lunch and dinner upon advance notice.
About 50 paces from the lodge, and also just inside the park entrance, is Tree House (%bookings 06562-222650; r ₹590). It has two elevated sets of rooms built of teak, and contains two bedrooms (one double, one single), a bathroom and an observation deck with the same views as Tourist Lodge. It's more basic, but great value. Both can be booked through the park office.
If they are booked out, spend the night at the government-run Van Vihar (%07352006141; d with/without AC ₹1030/600; a), 100m before the park entrnace. It's a hulking property that was undergoing wholesale renovations when we last visited, so should be spick and span by the time you arrive. It also has a restaurant.
JEEP SAFARI COSTS
Jeep safaris can be arranged privately at the Betla (Palamau) National Park gate. The breakdown of the costs for jeep safaris is as follows: Park entry (per vehicle, per hour)
₹150
Compulsory guide (per vehicle, per hour) ₹100
Jeep hire (per vehicle, per hour) ₹450
Camera fee (per person, per safari) ₹100
So, for example; a two-hour jeep safari for two people, both with cameras, would cost a total of ₹1600. For a single person, it would cost ₹1500. Jeep safaris can last from one hour to up to three or four hours, depending on how long you wish to spend in the park.8 Getting There & Away The nearest town to the park entrance is Daltonganj, about 20km away, which has frequent bus services to Ranchi throughout the day (₹160, 4½ hours). From Daltonganj take a local bus (₹20, roughly hourly until around 4pm) or shared autorickshaw (₹30) to Betla. A private auto from Daltonganj will cost around ₹300. If you're able to explain where you're going to the bus conductor, you can save some time by getting off the Ranchi bus at the turn-off for Betla, about 10km before Daltonganj. From here you can wave down a passing bus (₹10) or shared auto (₹20), or hire a private auto (₹200) to the park.
If you don't fancy going it alone, Suhana Tour & Travels, based in Ranchi, does two-day trips to Betla for ₹4200 per person (minimum two people).Sikkim

SikkimWhy Go?
Hailed as one of the world's last utopias by legendary Buddhist guru Padmasambhava, Sikkim is arguably among the loveliest destinations in India. And what variety in such a small state: plunging rhododendron-clad mountain valleys in the north; West Sikkim's atmospheric Buddhist monasteries; monumental religious statues in South Sikkim; and friendly and cheerful urban centres in the east. Then there are stunning views of Khangchendzonga, the world's third-highest mountain (8598m), visible from almost any viewpoint in the state. Little wonder that this tiny former Himalayan kingdom is such a haven for travellers.
A strong preserve of Tibetan Buddhism, Sikkim's public aesthetics are executed in shades of ritualistic vermilion, gold, blue and green, which make striking photo ops. Throw in yummy local food, exotic Himalayan wildlife, picture-postcard landscapes and some great hikes, and you have a superb mountain escape on the cards.
When to Go
A Oct–mid-Nov Clearest weather for views, but there are high-season crowds and prices.A Apr–May Spring blossoms and warmth make up for the cloudier skies. A Mid-Jun–Sep Monsoon plays spoilsport, but there are great discounts on offer.

History Sikkim was uninhabited until the 13th century, when the Lepchas migrated here from Assam or Myanmar (Burma), followed by Bhutias arriving from Tibet in the 15th century. In the 19th century, large numbers of Hindu migrants arrived from Nepal, forming a majority of Sikkim’s population.
The Nyingmapa form of Vajrayana (Tibetan) Buddhism arrived with three refugee Tibetan lamas who met in modern-day Yuksom. Here in 1641 they crowned Phuntsog Namgyal as first chogyal (king) of Sikkim. The capital later moved to Rabdentse (near Pelling), then to Tumlong in North Sikkim, before finally settling in Gangtok.
In their heydays, the chogyals ruled eastern Nepal, upper Bengal and Darjeeling. However, much territory was lost during wars with Bhutan and Nepal. In 1835, the British bribed the chogyal to cede Darjeeling to the East India Company, a move that was strongly opposed by Tibet, which regarded Sikkim as a vassal state. In 1849, the British annexed the entire area between the present Sikkim border and the Ganges plains, and subsequently repulsed a counterinvasion by Tibet in 1886. Sikkim’s last chogyal ruled from 1963 to 1975, after which the kingdom merged with the Indian dominion and was given statehood.
In the past decade, Sikkim has made considerable progress to become one of India's model states with high employment and low poverty. It is the first among Indian states to implement successful projects in organic farming, rural sanitation, public health and secondary education across its districts.2 Activities Going on a trek is the highpoint of any Sikkim sojourn. From day hikes between villages along centuries-old foot trails to multiday slogs across high mountain passes, there are plenty of trekking options available in the state. The most popular short hikes are the routes between Yuksom and Tashiding, and Yuksom and Khecheopalri Lake. Longer options that score well with experienced adventurers are the trek to Goecha La at the base of Khangchendzonga, and the Singalila Ridge trek that connects Yuksom to West Sikkim along the eponymous mountain ridge. Treks to remote areas such as Zemu Glacier and Green Lake are yet to be fully opened up, though it's possible to visit these areas if you have lots of money and permit-processing time to spare.
Apart from trekking, adventure activities such as mountain biking and paragliding are slowly becoming popular in Sikkim. The Sikkim Paragliding Festival (www.paraglidingassociationofindia.org), held in Gangtok in winter, sees plenty of participation from travellers and adventure junkies alike.
TOP FESTIVALS

EAST SIKKIM
Connected by a highway and speedy helicopter services with the rest of India, East Sikkim is focused around the urban hub of its capital Gangtok, and sees a higher tourist footfall than other parts of the state. The relaxed and casual grain of life, combined with a rush of cosmopolitan conveniences and points of touristy interest, makes this a nice place to kick back for a few days.
Gangtok
%03592 Pop 98,600 Elev 1750m
Irreverent, cheerful and pleasantly boisterous, Sikkim’s modern capital perches along a precipitous mountain ridge, descending down the hillside in steep tiers. A gradually growing sprawl of concrete, the town is blessed with a handful of sights, and doubles as a good base for excursions to places such as Rumtek and Tsomgo Lake. Travellers usually linger here for a few days, soaking up the local culture, stealing Khangchendzonga views from hotel terraces and arranging theirtravels (eg treks and tours) around the state.
The Rangpo–Mangan road (marked NH31A) forms the crooked north–south spine of Gangtok. Several restaurants, shops, banks, travel agents and tourist offices line the central pedestrianised Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Marg, a happy district patronised by shoppers, lovers, diners and fashionistas.Gangtok

GOOGLE MAP
 ; www.tibetology.net; Deorali; admission ₹10; h10am-4pm)
This fantastic museum housed in a traditional Tibetan-style mansion boasts a jaw-dropping collection of artefacts related to Vajrayana Buddhism and Tibetan culture. Established in 1958 to promote scholastic and cultural research, its ground-floor hall displays Buddhist manuscripts, icons, thangkas (Tibetan cloth paintings) and Tantric ritual objects, such as a thöpa (bowl made from a human skull) and kangling (human thighbone trumpet). The library on the 1st floor houses precious Buddhist tomes, some dating back several hundred years.
The revamped souvenir store within the building sells a collection of ritual objects, jewellery, mementos, books and documentaries on Sikkimese tradition and culture.
Five minutes up the same road is the Do-Drul Chorten, a large white stupa surrounded by monks' hostels and glass-walled galleries with countless flaming butter lamps burning within. Feel free to step in and light some as personal offerings (per lamp ₹7).

On the northern outskirts of Gangtok, approached through gently rustling conifers, stands this atmospheric and quaint monastery, with lovely murals and statues of Tantric deities. Some say the monastery's founder was known for his levitational skills. It's easily Gangtok’s most attractive hermitage and comes alive for the colourful Detor Chaam masked dances in December/January.
To get here, hire a taxi from MG Marg (₹200) or simply walk for about 3km from MG Marg, first up to the ridge and then roughly in a northwestern direction (ask locals and they'll happily point you up the right path).

Among the better-maintained zoos in the country, the Gangtok zoo occupies an entire hill opposite Ganesh Tok viewpoint. Red pandas, civet cats, Himalayan bears, clouded leopards and snow leopards roam around in extensive forested enclosures so large that you’ll value a car to shuttle between them (although a walk through the dense greenery is recommended over motorised transport). There's a cafeteria within the zoo, with refreshments (snacks ₹30) and restroom facilities.

VIEWPOINT

 )Festooned in colourful prayer flags and located opposite the zoo's main entrance is Ganesh Tok viewpoint, which offers superb city views, hot tea and Indian snacks (₹50). Hanuman Tok, another impressive viewpoint, sits on a hilltop around 4km beyond Ganesh Tok. The best Khangchendzonga views, however, are at Tashi viewpoint, 4km northwest of town, beside the road to Phodong.
2 Activities Early-morning ‘three-point' jeep tours show you Ganesh Tok, Hanuman Tok and Tashi viewpoints
(₹800). Almost any travel agent, hotel or taxi driver offers variants, including a ‘five-point' tour adding Enchey Gompa and Namgyal Institute (₹1000), or ‘seven-point' tours taking on Old and New Rumtek Gompas (₹1600) or Rumtek plus Lingdum (₹1800). Prices are per vehicle for up to four passengers.
For high-altitude treks, visits to Tsomgo Lake or tours to North Sikkim you’ll need a tour agency. Not all agents work with foreigners, so look for one that's registered with Travel Agents Association of Sikkim (TAAS; www.taas.org.in). All-inclusive trekking charges for foreigners range from US$60 to US$100 per person per day, depending on group size and services offered.

Around Gangtok
Rumtek
Facing Gangtok distantly across a plunging green valley, Rumtek is a pretty village dominated by its extensive and eponymous gompa complex, considered to be one of Tibetan Buddhism's most venerable institutions and currently the home-in-exile of Buddhism’s Kagyu (Black Hat) sect. Time permitting, you can make a quick sortie to Lingdum gompa as well, linked to Rumtek by beautiful country lanes that wind through mossy forests, bamboo groves and artistically terraced paddy fields.
1 Sights
o Rumtek Gompa
MONASTERY
(%03592-252329; www.rumtek.org; monastery admission ₹10; hmonastery 6am-6pm)
Meant to replace the Tsurphu Monastery in Tibet, Rumtek's main monastery building was constructed between 1961 and 1966 Unusually for a monasterybuilding was constructed between 1961 and 1966. Unusually for a monastery, the place is guarded by armed forces, following heated altercations and an invasion by partisan monks in the wake of the Karmapa controversy. To enter, foreigners must show their passport and Sikkim permit at the checkpost.
The rambling and walled gompa complex contains religious buildings, schools and a few small lodge-hotels, snack shops and souvenir stalls for travellers. There’s a mural of the original Tsurphu Monastery – destroyed during the Chinese Cultural Revolution – beside the main entrance. In the main hall, a giant throne awaits the crowning of the Kagyu spiritual leader, the (disputed) 17th Karmapa, who currently resides in Dharamsala. An ornate scroll, hand-painted by the young leader, adorns the monastery in his absence.
Behind the monastery building, up a flight of stairs running past a snack shop (good tea, instant noodles and momos) stands the Golden Stupa (h6am-11.45am & noon-5pm). Stuffed with religious paraphernalia, the smallish room holds the ashes of the 16th Karmapa in an amber, coral and turquoise-studded reliquary to which pilgrims pay their deepest respects. The keys to the shrine are usually with obliging lamas enrolled at the Karma Shri Nalanda Institute of Buddhist Studies opposite. Leave a donation and you'll be blessed with a holy metal dorje (talisman symbolising lightning).
The knowledgeable, witty and dapper Monay Rai gives a wonderful tour of the monastery (₹250).
Old Rumtek Gompa
(hdawn-dusk)F
MONASTERY
About 1.5km beyond Rumtek Gompa, a long avenue of prayer flags and junipers leads photogenically down to the forlorn and atmospheric Old Rumtek Gompa, looking out to some fabulous views. The monastery is still in use, and the main prayer hall has been renovated. Two days before the Sikkimese New Year, the monastery comes to life with chaam dances.
Lingdum Gompa
(hdawn-dusk)F
MONASTERY
Completed as recently as 1998, peaceful Lingdum Gompa grows out of pine forests in impressive layers, with pleasant side gardens and a photogenicchorten. The extensively muralled main prayer hall enshrines huge statues of Sakyamuni Buddha, Guru Rinpoche and the 16th Karmapa.
z Festivals & Events The much-fancied Mahakala Dance (hFeb) takes place in February, when giant figurines of the fierce protector deity come to life in the central courtyard.
Rumtek holds impressive masked chaam dances during the annual Drupchen (hMay/Jun) group meditation in May/June, and two days before Losar (Tibetan New Year; February/March).
THE KARMAPA CONTROVERSY
The ‘Black Hat’ sect takes its name from a priceless ruby-topped black headgear traditionally worn by the Karmapas (reincarnate spiritual leaders). Supposedly woven from the hair of dakinis (angels), the hat must be kept locked in a box to prevent it from flying back to the heavens.
Nobody, however, has actually seen the hat since 1993, when a bitter controversy spewed within the Kagyu sect over the legitimacy of two candidates, with both claiming their right to the throne following the death of the 16th Karmapa. The main candidate, Ogyen Trinley Dorje (www.kagyuoffice.org), fled Tibet in 2000 and remains based in Dharamsala: Indian authorities are believed to have prevented him from officially taking up his Rumtek seat for fear of upsetting Chinese government sensibilities. The rival candidate, Thaye Dorje (www.karmapa.org), lives in nearby Kalimpong in West Bengal. Supporters of the two are locked in a legal dispute over who can control Rumtek. To learn more about the controversy, read The Dance of 17 Lives by Mick Brown.
Only when the dispute is resolved and the 17th Karmapa is finally crowned would anyone dare to unlock the box and reveal the sacred black hat.

Tsomgo (Changu) Lake
Pronounced Changu, this high-altitude lake (3780m) 38km from Gangtok is madly popular with Indian travellers, though foreigners require a permit to visit. It's not the prettiest mountain lake in the world, but if you're still keen on checking it out, sign up for a tour by 2pm and most Gangtok agents can get the permit for next-day departure (two photos required). A budget day tour will cost around ₹4000 per vehicle or ₹800 per person if you can get a group together.At the lakeside, food stalls sell hot chai, chow mein and momos, and short yak rides (₹200) potter along the shore.
Nathu La
Indian citizens are permitted to continue 18km north along the rough road from Tsomgo Lake to the 4130m Nathu La (Listening Ears Pass), on the border with Tibet. It's currently sealed and no crossing over is allowed, although tourists can walk all the way to the barbed wires and pose with Indian and Chinese soldiers for photo ops.
A few kilometres southeast of Nathu La, Jelep La was the pass used by Francis Younghusband during the British invasion of Tibet (1903–04). Before being sealed along with Nathu La in 1962, Jelep La was the main regional trade route between Kalimpong and Lhasa. As of now, neither pass shows any sign of reopening.
NORTH SIKKIM
%03592 / Pop 43,700
Both breathtakingly beautiful and dauntingly dangerous, the pristine mountains of North Sikkim are blessed with nature's unspoilt bounties. Landscape lovers head to the idyllic valleys of Yumthang and Tsopta, but travelling here requires some stamina and a special permit, which is easy to obtain if you sign up for a tour. April, May, October and November are the best months to visit. Avoid the monsoon, when the rains are often accompanied by landslides and earthquakes.
NORTH SIKKIM TOUR TIPS
A A group of four is ideal for sharing costs while not overfilling a jeep. Solo travellers must find at least one copassenger and qualify as a 'group' to apply for permits.
A Travelling as part of a tour organised by a registered travel agent is both mandatory and recommended. Agents in Gangtok can find you jeep-share partners quite easily, so ask around a few days before you plan to travel.
A Set aside at least four days to comfortably visit both Yumthang/Lachung and Lachen. Three days is enough to see just Yumthang. All-inclusive three-night, four-day tours startfrom around ₹9000 per person for groups of four.
A Break camp early in the morning and maximise your time on the road for photo ops and sightseeing.
A Bring a torch (flashlight) and warm clothes.
Gangtok to Singhik
Shortly after exiting Gangtok begins a hair-raising journey along the frail and narrow NH31A. You'll pass through wooded slopes high above the Teesta River, occasionally descending in long coils of hairpin bends to a bridge photogenically draped in prayer flags, only to switchback up again on the other side.
Kabi Lunchok, an atmospheric glade decorated with memorial stones 17km north of Gangtok, is the site of a 13th-century peace treaty between the chiefs of the Lepcha and Bhutia tribes. Consider breaking your journey here for a while. The small 290-year-old Nyingmapa-school Phensang Gompa is further north, 1km off the main road.
Just over 30km north of Gangtok, Seven Sisters Waterfall, a multistage cascade, cuts a chasm above a roadside cardamom grove and plummets into a rocky pool. Further down the road is Phodong (1815m), lined with a strip of roadside restaurants that serve quick-and-ready lunch. About 1km past Phodong, a 15-minute walk along a side road leads to Phodong Gompa (established in 1740). Belonging to the Kagyu sect, it houses extensive murals and a large statue of the ninth Karmapa.
With time to spare, drive or walk another 1.5km uphill to the much more atmospheric Labrang Gompa (established in 1884), home to 100 monks. The inner walls of the eight-sided main building are lined with more than 1000 icons of Padmasambhava, while upstairs a fearsome statue of the guru sports a necklace of severed heads.
Between the two monasteries, just below the road, lie the 19th-century foundations of Tumlong, Sikkim’s third capital. The enigmatic palace ruins are worth a quick scramble.
North Sikkim’s district headquarters are located in Mangan, 28km from Phodong. Singhik, Mangan's twin village, is just a few bends down the road.NATURE'S FURY
In September 2011 a 6.9-magnitude earthquake rocked North Sikkim, claiming more than 100 lives and leaving indelible marks of destruction on the landscape, architecture and the minds of citizens. Further damage was inflicted by another earthquake and a flash flood in September 2012. While the region has recovered considerably from the twin blows, future disasters are always a possibility. Check local conditions before you travel.
Beyond Singhik
With relevant permits and an organised tour you can continue north beyond Singhik. At Chungthang, the next settlement, the road branches up the Lachung Chu and Lachen Chu valleys. If you only have time to visit one valley, the Lachung Chu has more impressive scenery.
Accommodation is available in Lachung and Lachen.
Lachung
%03592 Pop 2450 Elev 2910m
Soaring rock-pinnacled valley walls embroidered with long ribbons of waterfalls surround the scattered village of Lachung. To appreciate the full drama of its setting, take the metal cantilever bridge across the wild Yumthang River and then climb 1.5km for great views from the Lachung (Sarchok) Gompa (established 1880). Don't attempt this walk in bad weather though.
More than 50 hotels are dotted around Lachung. Most are simple family-run budget properties. Each is comparable to the other with basic rooms, bathrooms and traditional Tibetan-style wood-fire kitchens, a cosy place to linger over a butter tea or chhang. Unless you specifically opt for top-end accommodation as part of the package, your tour operator will prechoose one of these hotels for the night and you'll have to accept this preference.
If you don't mind paying surplus cash to stay at a more luxurious place, the
gompa-style hotel Modern Residency (%03592-204220; www.modernresidency.com;Singring village; d incl full board ₹6800), 3km south of Lachung, has comfortable, well- decorated rooms done up in local motifs and appointed with snug beds, luxe creature comforts and fresh toilets. Pluses include a minimuseum, library and bar. You can book through Gangtok-based Modern Treks & Tours (

Early birds stand to get good discounts.
The fancy resort Mayfair Yarlam (%9434330033; www.yarlamresort.com; Main Rd; d incl
full board from ₹8800; i), possibly the top place in Yumthang, is also a good place to stay, with smart cosy rooms and amenities such as round-the-clock hot water, flatscreen TVs and internet via satellite connections. However, it is preferred by top-end international tour operators for their groups and remains largely booked out during April, May, October and November.
Yumthang Valley
The main reason to come to Lachung is to continue 24km further north to admire the majestic Yumthang Valley, which starts some 10km past Lachung. This point is also the entry to the Singba Rhododendron Sanctuary, whose network of hiking trails offers a welcome chance to get out of the jeep. From March to early May a host of primulas, 24 species of rhododendrons and other alpine flora burst forth in riotous blossom, carpeting the valley floor.
At the Km24 point, a number of snack shacks and souvenir stalls operate in the high season. There's also a tiny museum (opening hours are irregular) with a display of Tibetan and Sikkimese relics. From here, you can walk ahead and explore the pretty terrain, which slowly transforms into a montage of jagged peaks, lush pastures and bridges draped with colourful prayer flags. The glacial waters of the Yumthang River gurgle through the scene. Come early in the morning for the best photo ops, before the clouds roll in.
Lachen
Pop 2000 / Elev 2700m
Despite a recent invasion of concrete, the traditional mountain village of Lachen retains its quaintness in the form of old wooden homes on sturdy stone bases, logsheds stacked with timber for winter fuel, and plenty of colour in the form of ornate Tibetan-style window frames and prayer flags. Lachen (Nyudrup Choeling) Gompa is a 15-minute walk above the town and is most likely to be open early morning or late afternoon for rituals.
While primarily serving as a night stop for exploring the higher valley of Tsopta, Lachen is also the trailhead for eight-day expeditionary treks to Green Lake (5050m) along the Zemu Glacier (thought to be filled with the yeti, or abominable snowman), towards Khangchendzonga’s northeast face. Consider this trek with lots of money, time and patience to spare as permits are extremely difficult to obtain.
Of the few accommodation options available for tourists to choose from, most
groups prefer the Lachen View Point (%9434867312; d incl full board from ₹3000),
which has good-value rooms and efficient service. Alternatively, try the luxurious and hospitable Apple Orchard Resort (%9474837640;
www.theappleorchardresort.com; d incl full board ₹9500), above the village next to the ani
gompa (nunnery). It has cosy and inviting rooms (with graceful wooden flooring and panelling) located in smart buildings thrown around a leafy, tiered complex.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
THANGGU & TSOPTA
Beyond a sprawling army camp 32km north of Lachen, Thanggu (3850m) has an end-of- the-world feel. There are no phones (mobile or otherwise), the electricity is solar generated and the Chinese are only 15km away.
Thanggu Resort (Main Rd; snacks ₹100; hMay-Nov) is a simple wooden house incorporating a traditional-styled kitchen and tongba-drinking den (tongba ₹50) that offers the only toilet and breakfast stop (snacks ₹100) along the route.
From Thanggu, a boulder-strewn stream leads on 2km to the Tsopta Valley. Just above the tree line, the scenery takes on the added drama of a glacier-toothed mountain wall framing the western horizon. A two-hour hike leads up to a pair of meditation caves, one of which was used for two years by the famous French traveller and mystic Alexandra David-Neel.
Indian visitors can continue 30km north to spectacular Gurudongmar Lake (5150m), right on the border with Tibet, but the glacial lake is off-limits to foreigners.
SOUTH SIKKIMSOUTH SIKKIM
People visit the lofty hills of South Sikkim either to gaze at the sky-piercing statues of Namchi and Ravangla, or to find religion in the latter's atmospheric monasteries. This is also the state's only tea-growing region, and the gardens of Temi are a delightful stopover for anyone travelling the road between Gangtok and West Sikkim.
Namchi
%03595 / Pop 12,200 / Elev 1525m
The hulking religious superstructures that dot the jagged horizon of Namchi are perhaps the only reason why travellers swing by this tiny settlement. There are several internet cafes in the central pedestrianised plaza, along with an Axis Bank ATM, two ancient bodhi and pipal trees and an aquarium with angel fish, parrot fish and piranhas.

Samdruptse
(Padmasambhava Statue; admission ₹30; hdawn-dusk)
MONUMENT
Painted in shimmering copper, pink and bronze, the 45m-high statue of Guru Padmasambhava lords over the forested Samdruptse ridge and is visible for miles around. Completed in 2004 on a foundation stone laid by the Dalai Lama, the statue of the hallowed Buddhist leader sits atop a giant lotus plinth and makes for a striking photo op. Within the complex, there's a permanent photo exhibition of archival images documenting Sikkim's cultural, natural and artistic history.
The site is 7km from Namchi, 2km off the Damthang/Ravangla road. Taxis from town charge around ₹700 return. Alternatively, pay ₹500 for a one-way trip and walk back to Namchi, following the road down to the atmospheric Ngadak Gompa. Pass the ruined Ngadak Dzong, which dates back to 1717 and still exudes a sense of antique Sikkim.Char Dham
(Siddesvara Dham; ₹30 per vehicle; h8am-noon & 1-7pm)
MONUMENT
Spread over the Solophuk hilltop 5km south of Namchi, the site of Char Dham is towered over by a massive 33m Shiva statue. The complex intends to bring together all revered Hindu pilgrimages from across India (albeit in the form of replicas), and is strewn with temples and pagodas built on an epic scale. A taxi here costs ₹700/500 for a return/one-way trip, and the Yatri Nivas guesthouse dishes out a superb thali (₹200) for lunch.
Apart from visiting these concrete behemoths (each of which enshrines sundry deities of the Hindu pantheon), there's a 4D simulator show (₹50) that recreates popular pilgrimages, aeroplane flights and car races for kids.

The gompas of Ralang, Tashiding, Pemayangtse and Sangachoeling are all distantly visible against a horizon that’s sawtoothed with high mountain peaks.
A cheerful and laid-back town, Ravangla is useful as a hub to visit surrounding sights. Joining the main highway is the Main Bazaar, a concentration of shops, cheap hotels, the jeep stand and the Cyber Cafe (Main

The SNT bus booking office is part of Hotel 10Zing. Morning buses run to Namchi (₹45, one hour, 9am) and Siliguri (₹190, five hours, 6.30am).
Around Ravangla
Beside the main Legship road, 5.5km from central Ravangla, the small but fascinating Yungdrung Kundrakling is the only Bon monastery in Sikkim. Animistic in nature, Bon preceded Buddhism in Tibet but has since been largely subsumed by it. The deities look slightly different and prayer wheels are turned anticlockwise. Flash photography is prohibited within. You can get here from Ravangla on a Kewzing-bound shared jeep (₹20). Friendly monks will be happy to brief you on Bon while you're exploring the monastery.
Back in Ravangla, a steep four-hour hiking trail leads from above Tathagata Tsal to the top of Maenam Hill (3150m). En route, you'll pass the springtime rhododendrons and magnolia blooms of the Maenam Wildlife Sanctuary. From the summit, continue 2km to Bhaledunga rock, where you can enjoy sweeping views and a chance encounter with red pandas and monal pheasants (Sikkim's state bird). Hire a guide (₹600) at the forestry check post to avoid getting lost.
Ralang
At Ralang, 13km below Ravangla, the splendid 1995 Palchen Choeling Monastic Institute (New Ralang Gompa) is home to about 200 Kagyu-order monks. Arrive early morning or around 3pm to hear them chanting in mesmerising unison. There’s a 9m-high golden statue of the historical Buddha in the main hall, and the gompa is famous for elaborate butter sculptures. Peek into the side room to see the amazing effigies used in November’s impressive Mahakala dance held in the monastery's expansive courtyard.
About 1.5km downhill on the same road is the peaceful (and still active) Old Ralang Gompa, established in 1768 and definitely worth a hike from the newmonastery. A chartered taxi to Ralang costs around ₹600 return from Ravangla (with two hours’ wait).
Temi
Located 16km south of Ravangla, the jade-green estate of Temi is as famous for its fine-quality tea and its gorgeous mountain scenery. The only tea garden in Sikkim, it drapes some 180 hectares of hill slopes that are fronted by a stupendous hill-lined horizon, towered over by the Khangchendzonga massif.
Accommodation is available at the government-run Cherry Resort
(%8016488737; www.cherryresort.com; Temi Tea Estate; s/d incl breakfast from ₹2900/3400), a
stylish property slap-bang in the middle of the plantations overlooking the Teesta valley far below. The spacious rooms have fantastic patios and a terrace with magnificent views of summits and the plantations. The food is unimaginative but delicious, and there's great tea to go with your meals and snacks.
Shared jeeps from Ravangla (₹50, 30 minutes) bound for Siliguri via Damthang and Rangpo can drop you at the resort.
WEST SIKKIM
Towered over by the sublime Khangchendzonga, West Sikkim's breathtaking landscape is strung out along formidable mountain ridges draped in evergreen alpine forests. A handful of intriguing monasteries, villages and waterfalls add to its overall appeal, and make it an ideal spot for footloose hiking. The fabulous Goecha La trek, which takes hikers to the icy base of Khangchendzonga, begins in the village of Yuksom (which is also the trailhead for some pleasant day hikes). Comfort seekers, on the other hand, can simply settle for stupendous mountain views from Pelling.
Geyzing & Tikjuk

Located 6km from Pelling, Tikjuk is the District Administrative Centre for WestSikkim. Permits can be extended at the Superintendent of Police office (Side
wing, 3rd fl; h10am-4pm Mon-Sat, closed 2nd Sat of month). Geyzing, its contiguous twin, is
most useful as West Sikkim’s transport hub. Frequent shared jeeps go to Jorethang (₹90, 1½ hours), Pelling (₹20, 20 minutes), Tashiding (₹70, 1½ hours) and Yuksom (₹100, 2½ hours). Several serve Gangtok (₹190, seven to nine hours, 7am to 12.30pm), Ravangla (₹70, one hour, 9am and 11.45am) and Siliguri (₹200, four hours, 7am and 12.30pm).

In the far southwest corner of Sikkim, close to the India–Nepal border, lies the Varsey Rhododendron Sanctuary, known to be the native habitat of more than 500 species of rhododendrons. Well off the tourist route, this exotic forest (at an altitude of about 3050m) can be accessed by a two-hour trek through enchanted pine forests from the village of Hilley, about 28km from Pelling. Hemmed by the Singalila Ridge, the forest bursts into a riot of colours in April and May. A few basic lodges provide overnight accommodation in the sanctuary – contact Sikkim Tourism Development Corporation for details.

Pelling’s raison d’être is its stride-stopping, jaw-dropping view of Khangchendzonga at dawn (weather permitting, that is). It's otherwise a fairly nondescript town, with a 2km stretch of boxed-out tourist hotels that line its main thoroughfare, frequented by hordes of local tourists through the year.
Pelling is nominally divided into Upper, Middle and Lower areas. A focal point of Upper Pelling is a small roundabout where the main road from Geyzing turns 360 degrees in front of Hotel Garuda. At the same point, minor roads branch south to Dentam and southwest to the tourist office and the helipad, which has magnificent panoramic views at dawn.Pelling

The ground floor features a central Buddha, while on the 1st floor, fierce-looking statues depict all eight reincarnations of Padmasambhava. On the top floor is an astounding seven-tiered model representing Padmasambhava’s heavenly abode of Zangtok Palri, handmade over five laborious years by a single dedicated lama.
During February and March, impressive chaam dances celebrating Losar culminate with the unfurling of a huge gyoku (giant embroidered thangka) and the zapping of evil demons with a great fireball.
Pemayangtse is 1.5km from Upper Pelling, along the road to Geyzing, and is easily combined with a visit to Rabdentse. The signposted turn-off is near an obvious stupa.
If you are walking to or from Pemayangtse, pop into the self-service Lotus
Bakery (Geyzing Rd; cakes ₹25-30; h8am-5pm), about 20 minutes from town, for a
restorative slice of carrot or banana cake. All money raised goes to the nearby Denjog Pema Choling Academy, which works with underprivileged children.
Rabdentse
Rabdentse (hdawn-dusk) was the royal capital of Sikkim from 1670 to 1814. It is now in ruins and consists only of chunky wall-stubs with a few inset inscription stones. The selling point of the site, however, is the utterly fabulous viewpoint on which the ruins are located. The entrance is around 3km from Upper Pelling, along the road to Geyzing. The ruins are a 10-minute walk from the site’s yellow gateway – beware of leeches in the undergrowth.
THE FARMHOUSE CIRCUIT
A bucolic expanse of unspoilt sylvan beauty, the surrounds of Rinchenpong village in West Sikkim is home to a number of plush farmhouses that offer a luxurious stay amid pristine forests, orchards and farmlands, with copious mountain views all around. Anhour's drive from Pelling, the area is slowly attracting leisure seekers who wish to give urban chaos the slip and enjoy nature's charms for a few days. Biksthang (%9593779077; www.biksthang.com; Mangalbarey Village; s/d incl half board ₹4350/6150; s), an utterly beautiful farmhouse built around a 19th-century family estate, boasts ultrasnug cottages with lavish interiors and superb home-cooked Sikkimese food. Yangsum Heritage Farm (%9434179029; www.yangsumheritagefarm.com; Rinchenpong; d incl full board ₹5100), another popular hideaway, scores with its air of quaintness, expansive plantations and cottages that come with incremental degrees of comfort and luxury. Both farms can organise transport from Siliguri, Gangtok or Pelling upon advance request.
The Monastery Loop
The picturesque western frontiers of Sikkim can technically be enjoyed on a day- long or overnight jeep tour from Pelling. Time permitting, however, you can do an adventurous three-day trip from Pelling to Tashiding via Khecheopalri Lake, using a combination of jeeps and hiking. Alternatively, consider an outing to wonderful Yuksom via Khecheopalri Lake, and a subsequent multiday high- altitude trek that takes you up close and personal with Khangchendzonga.
Pelling to Yuksom
Apart from dipping your toes in the cascading waters of the Rimbi, Khangchendzonga and Phamrong Falls, the only major sight on this stretch is the hallowed Khecheopalri Lake (admission ₹10; hdawn-dusk). Located at 1950m, this placid natural reservoir – pronounced 'ketchup-perry' – is highly revered by both Sikkimese Buddhists and Lepcha animists who believe its shape to be akin to the footprint of the goddess Tara. Legend also has it that birds assiduously remove any leaves from its surface, keeping it clean through the year.
During the springtime festival Khecheopalri Mela (Khecheopalri Lake;
hMar/Apr), butter lamps are floated out across the lake. Prayer wheels line the lake’s jetty, backed by fluttering prayer flags and Tibetan inscriptions, but the setting, ringed with forested hills, is serene rather than dramatic.
Day jeep tours typically drop you at a car park five minutes from the lake, allowing you 30 minutes of sightseeing time. The best way to appreciate the site, however, is to stay overnight and visit once the tourists have left.Around the car park is a Buddhist nunnery, a couple of shops and the simple Jigme Restaurant serving tea and chow mein (snacks ₹50). From the car park, a path to the left leads uphill for 20 minutes to Khecheopalri Gompa and stupa, from where you can hike up to several viewpoints.
Just beside the gompa and overseen by a local lama is Pala’s Guest House (%9832471253; per person incl 3 meals ₹600), with more rooms available at the next-door annex. On the main approach to the car park, Teng Hang Limboo operates a basic homestay at the Family Guest House (%9609874677; per person ₹400).
Shared jeeps to Pelling (₹60, two hours) leave the car park at 6am, or you could hitch a ride on a reserved tourist jeep returning to Pelling.
A hiking trail to Yuksom (9km, three to five hours) leaves the road just opposite Family Guest House, descending steeply to the main road (take the right branch after crossing the Runom Khola River) and emerging near Khangchendzonga Falls. After the road suspension bridge, follow the concrete steps uphill to meet the Yuksom road, about 2km below Yuksom village.
Yuksom
%03595 Pop 1850 Elev 1780m
Loveable little Yuksom is historic, charming and unspoilt, although concretisation is fast taking over (the latest addition is an enclosed complex studded with gigantic prayer wheels along the settlement's main drag). Yuksom is the main trailhead for the treks towards Mt Khangchendzonga, and is a good place to kick back for a few quiet nights.
1 Sights
Norbugang Park
(hdawn-dusk)F
HISTORIC SITE
Yuksom means ‘meeting place of the three lamas’, referring to the trio of Tibetan holy men who crowned the first chogyal of Sikkim at this historic site in 1641. The charming complex contains a small temple, a huge prayer wheel, a chorten and the supposedly original Coronation Throne (Norbugang), fromwhich it takes its current name.
Standing beneath a vast cryptomeria pine, the site looks something like an ancient Olympic podium hewn out of stone. Just in front is a spooky footprint fused into stone, believed to be that of one of the crowning lamas.
Dubdi Gompa
(hdawn-dusk)F
MONASTERY
High on the ridge above Yuksom, this atmospheric gompa (its name means
'hermit’s cell') is set in beautifully tended gardens behind three coarsely hewn stupas. Established in 1701, it is said to be Sikkim’s oldest monastery, though the current chapel looks much newer.
Start the steep 40-minute climb from upper Yuksom’s primary health centre; the clear path rises through thickets of trumpet lilies and some lovely mature forest.
Kathok Wodsallin Gompa
(hdawn-dusk)F
MONASTERY
This newly contructed gompa opposite Hotel Tashi Gang has an impressively stern statue of Guru Padmasambhava surrounded by a collection of yogis, gurus and lamas in glass-fronted compartments. The coloured motifs on the walls provide a few striking photo ops.

WORTH A TRIP
YUKSOM TO TASHIDING HIKE
This wonderful one-day hike requires no permits and can be done quite easily if you start in Yuksom. Figure on six hours of walking (19km), plus another two hours visiting the monasteries. Porter-guides are available in Yuksom for around ₹600.
Start by ascending to Dubdi Gompa, from where a path dips into a side valley for 40 minutes to Tsong. The trail splits here; take the upper trail leading uphill past cardamom fields to lonely Hongri Gompa, a small, unusually unpainted ancient monastery on a beautiful ridge. Local folklore claims the gompa was moved here from a higher spot where monks were being ravaged by yeti.
A signpost points the way downhill for 20 minutes to Nessa hamlet, 10 minutes below which is the village of Pokhari Dara (four hours from Yuksom). Follow the road until a footpath branches towards Sinon Gompa (built 1716). From here the stepped path drops steeply behind the yellow monastic school, following village trails down to Tashiding.
4 Sleeping & Eating Tourist traffic is heavy during peak trekking seasons (March to May and October to November), so book early.
Hotel Yangri Gang
(%9434164408; Main Rd; s/d from ₹500/800; i)
HOTEL
The better rooms at this functional hotel at the head of Yuksom's main street are on the upper floors. Beds are comfy, the wooden half-panelling is pleasant to the eye and there are hot showers through the day. Thanks to its in-house trekking

Hotel Demazong
(%9775473687; Main Rd; dm ₹150, d from ₹500)
HOTEL
Used by domestic trekking groups, this place has simple but clean rooms behind its boxy facade. The more expensive rooms have balconies. Don't expect much in terms of service though, and if a quiet stay is what you're looking for, you may have to stop elsewhere.
Hotel Tashi Gang
(%9733077249; hoteltashigang@gmail.com; Main Rd; s/d from ₹1500/2000)
HOTEL
Done up in rich Sikkimese motifs and colourful thangkas, the rooms at this popular hotel offer unbelievable value for money and, as a result, are mostly booked out. There's good food at the in-house restaurant, and the rooms out front have balconies opening in the direction of Khangchendzonga. There's a patch of front lawn hemmed by flowering plants.
Yuksum Residency
(%9933133330; www.yuksumresidency.com; Main Rd; s/d from ₹2700/3200; W)
HOTEL
Very plush, stylish and comfortable by Yuksom's standards, this upscale hotel has large rooms with giant windows overlooking soothing greenery. It has a pleasant terrace which doubles as a dining area in the evenings. All in all, the perfect place for returning trekkers in need of a hot shower and creature comforts. Service, however, can be somewhat impersonal.
Tibet Restaurant
TIBETAN
(Main Rd; mains ₹80-120; h6am-9pm)
There's a great selection of Tibetan and Sikkimese fare at this busy and buzzy eatery on Yuksom's main drag. The signature dish, however, is the Bhutanese- style ema datse, featuring pork and vegetables stewed in a fiery chilli cheese sauce, best combined with steamed rice and chilled beer.Gupta Restaurant
(Main Rd; mains ₹50-100; h5am-9pm)
MULTICUISINE
This alfresco restaurant belts out curries, pizza, instant noodles, breakfast platters and dinner thalis for a steady stream of diners through the day. The sociable thatched cabana outside is good for a beer with fellow travellers.
8 Getting There & Away At around 6.30am, several shared jeeps leave for Jorethang (₹160, four hours) via Tashiding (₹60, 1½ hours), Geyzing via Pelling (₹90, 2½ hours) and Gangtok (₹250, six hours). Book the day before at the shop next to Gupta Restaurant or the hut opposite.
Dzongri & Goecha La – The Khangchendzonga Trek
For guided groups with permits, Yuksom is the starting point for Sikkim’s classic seven-to 10-day trek to Goecha La, a 4940m pass with jaw-dropping views of Khangchendzonga.
Don’t underestimate the rigours of the trek – it's considered one of the most challenging hikes in the Indian Himalaya. Don’t climb too high too quickly: altitude sickness often strikes those who are fittest and fastest. Starting early makes sense, as rain is common in the afternoons, spoiling views and making trails annoyingly muddy. Check all your equipment before setting off – bring good-quality sleeping bags, torches (flashlights), some heavy woollens and rain gear. Also watch out for leeches in case you're trekking immediately after the monsoons; the local mosquito repellent Odomos does a good job at keeping the pesky creatures at bay.
March to May is an ideal time to trek. Monsoon clouds move in by the end of May, rendering the mountains unwalkable. The clearest skies are from October to December, but remember that snow starts to block the trails with the advent of winter.
The route initially follows the Rathong Valley through unspoilt forests before steeply ascending to Baktim (Bakhim; 2750m) and the rustic Tibetan village of Tsokha (3050m), established in 1969 by Tibetan refugees. Spending two nightshere helps with acclimatisation.
The next stage climbs to pleasant meadows around Dzongri (4020m). Consider another acclimatisation day here, best spent by strolling up to Dzongri La (4550m, four-hour round trip) for fabulous views of Mt Pandim (6691m).
From Dzongri, the trail drops steeply to Kokchurong and follows the river to Thangsing (3930m). Next day takes you to camping at Lamuni, 15 minutes before Samiti Lake (4200m). From here, a dawn assault the following morning takes you to the head-spinning Goecha La (4940m) for those incredible views of Khangchendzonga. A further viewpoint, another hour’s walk ahead, offers even closer views.
The return is essentially by the same route. An alternative is to cut south at Dzongri and follow the Singalila Ridge for a week to Uttarey, from where there are connections to Pelling and Jorethang.
There are government-run trekkers’ huts at Baktim, Tsokha, Dzongri, Kokchurong and Thangsing, but most have neither furniture nor mattresses, and can be crowded during peak trekking seasons. It’s far better to bring all camping equipment and food.Tashiding
Elev 1490m
Little Tashiding is a single, sloping market street forking north off the Yuksom– Legship road. A 2.5km uphill track from the main junction leads to a car park from where a footpath leads up between an avenue of prayer flags to the atmospheric Nyingmapa-school Tashiding Gompa (hdawn-dusk). It is about 30 minutes away via a steep 1km walk.
Founded in 1641 by one of the three Yuksom crowning lamas, the
monastery’s five colourful religious buildings are strung out between more functional monks’ quarters. Beautifully proportioned, the four-storey main prayer hall has a delicate filigree topknot, with wonderful views across the semiwild flower garden towards Ravangla. The Dalai Lama chose this magical spot for a two-day meditation retreat in 2010. Notice the cracks left in the marble flooring by the 2011 earthquake.
Beyond the last monastic building, an unusual compound contains dozens of white chortens, including the Thongwa Rangdol, said to absolve the sins of anyone who gazes upon it. More visually exciting is the golden Kench Chorgi Lorde stupa. Propped up all around are engraved stones bearing the Buddhist mantra om mani padme hum; at the back of the compound is the engraver’s lean- to.In February the monastery celebrates the Bumchu festival, when lamas gingerly open a sacred pot containing holy water and make important predictions by studying the level of water within.
There are a few scruffy lodges within Tashiding. The best beds, however, are at the government-run Yatri Niwas (%9832623654; Main Rd; d ₹2000). An excellent midrange place by the turn-off to the monastery, it offers spacious rooms, lovely gardens and a good restaurant.
Shared jeeps to Gangtok (₹190, four hours) and Geyzing (₹80, 1½ hours) leave from the main junction between 6.30am and 8am. For Siliguri, take a jeep to Jorethang (₹90, two hours) and change. A few jeeps to Yuksom (₹60, one hour) pass through during early afternoon.Northeast States

Northeast StatesWhy Go?
Thrown across the farthest reaches of India, obscured from the greater world by ageless forests and formidable mountain ranges, the Northeast States are one of Asia’s last great natural and anthropological sanctuaries. Sharing borders with Bhutan, Tibet, Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh, these remote frontiers are a region of rugged beauty, and a collision zone of tribal cultures, climates, landscapes and peoples. In this wonderland for adventurers, glacial Himalayan rivers spill onto Assam’s vast floodplains, faith moves mountains on the perilous pilgrimage to Tawang, rhinos graze in Kaziranga’s swampy grasslands and former head-hunters slowly embrace modernity in their ancestral longhouses in Nagaland.
Of course, it’s not all smooth sailing in these faraway states, and you have a horde of obstacles to battle along the way (bad roads, poor infrastructure and rebel armies, to name a few). In other words, only those with a taste for raw adventure need apply.

ASSAM
Sprawled lazily like a prehistoric leviathan along the length of the Brahmaputra valley, Assam (also known as Ahom) is the biggest and most accessible of the Northeast States. A hospitable population, a cuisine with its own distinctive aromas and flavours, a vibrant artistic heritage marked by exotic dance forms, and a string of elegant Hindu temples top its list of innumerable attractions, and no permits are required. The archetypal Assamese landscape is a picturesque golden-green vista of jigsaw-like rice fields and manicured tea estates, framed in the distance by the blue mountains of Arunachal in the north and the highlands of Meghalaya and Nagaland to the south.
Despite certain linguistic and cultural overlaps with people in neighbouring West Bengal and Orissa, Assam is proudly sovereign about its identity. The gamosa (a red-and-white scarf worn around the neck by men) and the mekhola sador (the traditional dress for women) are visible proclamations of regional costume and identity, while the subtly flavoured fish tenga (sour curry) is distinctly different from its other regional culinary cousins.
Guwahati
%0361 / Pop 809,500
The gateway to the northeast and the largest and most cosmopolitan city in theregion, Guwahati serves as the starting block for most Northeast itineraries. It’s a somewhat featureless city – a prosaic heap of glass and concrete for the most part – but there are a scattering of interesting temples to explore. Walk its back alleys and old quarters, however, and you will be able to salvage a generous amount of local flavour that lingers amid its suburban sprawl of ponds, palm trees, small single-storey traditional houses and old colonial-era mansions.
History Guwahati is considered the site of Pragjyotishpura, a semi-mythical town founded by Asura King Naraka (son of an avatar of Vishnu who later transformed into a demon), later killed by Krishna for a pair of magical earrings. The city was a vibrant cultural centre well before the Ahoms arrived from Southeast Asia around the 13th century, and it was subsequently the theatre of intense Ahom–Mughal strife, changing hands eight times in 50 years before 1681. In 1897 a huge earthquake – followed by a series of devastating floods – wiped out most of the old city.
Dormant through much of India’s colonial history, Guwahati gained metropolitan prominence after the formation of Assam state in the post- Independence era. Though technically not the state capital (the title goes to contiguous Dispur), Guwahati is, for all purpose and intent, Assam’s numero uno city.Guwahati

Kamakhya Mandir
(admission for no queue/short queue/queue ₹500/100/free; h8am-1pm & 3pm-dusk)
HINDU TEMPLE
According to Hindu legend, when an enraged Shiva dismembered his deceased wife Sati’s body into 108 pieces and scattered them across the land, her yoni (vagina) fell on Kamakhya Hill. This makes Kamakhya Mandir one of the most hallowed shrines for practitioners of shakti (tantric worship of female spiritual power). Goats are ritually beheaded here as offerings to the goddess in a gory pavilion and the hot, dark inner womblike sanctum is painted red to signify sacrificial blood. It is here that the Ambubachi Mela takes place.
Kamakhya is 7km west of central Guwahati and 3km up a spiralling side road. Occasional buses from Guwahati’s Kachari bus stand run all the way up (₹20, 30 minutes).

Around Guwahati
Hajo
Some 30km northwest of Guwahati, the pleasant little town of Hajo attracts Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims to its five ancient temples topping assorted hillocks.

Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary
(Indian/foreigner ₹50/500)
WILDLIFE RESERVE
Only 40km from northeast of Guwahati, this small wildlife sanctuary has a generous sprinkling of one-horned rhinoceros. Getting into the park involves a boat ride over the river boundary to the elephant-mounting station, from where you could embark on a one-hour trip atop an elephant, lumbering through boggy grasslands and stirring up petulant rhinos. The best way to get there is by taxi (return trip ₹1800).

RIVER RIDES
To experience the innate beauty of Assam from a unique perspective (and all of it in style), consider signing up for a plush river cruise. Departing Guwahati on set datesbetween September and April, these multiday luxury rides take you upstream along the Brahmaputra River all the way to Dibrugarh, dropping anchor at essential hotspots such as Kaziranga National Park, Majuli Island and Sivasagar.

The park consists of western, central and eastern ranges, the central range doubling as the venue for popular early-morning elephant safaris. Lasting an hour each, these rides offer unparalleled opportunities to get close to rhinos, which don’t seem phased by the elephants, even when surrounded by several safari groups. Safaris can be arranged at the Kaziranga Tourist Complex or directly with your accommodation.4 Sleeping & Eating In season, booking ahead and paying in advance is recommended.

DON'T MISS
TEA GETAWAYS
No visit to Upper Assam is complete without a lavish night or two in a heritage tea-estate bungalow, of which there are many in the region. For a memorable experience, try the antique crammed Banyan Grove (%033-22657389; www.heritagetourismindia.com; s/d incl full board ₹5600/6500; as) or the quaint colonial-era Thengal Manor (%033-22657389; www.heritagetourismindia.com; Jalukanburi; s/d incl full board ₹4000/6500; a), both a short drive out of Jorhat.

Accommodation here is in a charming planter's bungalow fronted by grassy lawns.

Majuli Island
%03775 / Pop 168,000
Beached amid the mighty Brahmaputra River’s ever-shifting puzzle of ochre sandbanks is Majuli, which at around 452 sq km is India’s largest river island. For a place continually ravaged by the primal forces of nature (much of the island disappears under water every monsoon), Majuli flaunts unparalleled scenic beauty. The island is a relaxed, shimmering mat of glowing rice fields and
d       b                 h h         h blwater meadows bursting with hyacinth blossoms.
Aside from enjoying the laid-back vibe, highlights of a visit include birdwatching (the island is home to nearly 100 species of birds) and learning about neo-Vaishnavite philosophy at Majuli’s 22 ancient satras (Hindu Vaishnavite monasteries and centres for art). But don’t waste time getting here – surveys indicate that at current levels of erosion the island will cease to exist within the next two decades.
The two main villages are Kamalabari, 3km from the ferry port, and Garamur, 5km further north. The most interesting, accessible satras are the large, beautifully peaceful Uttar Kamalabari (1km north, then 600m east of Kamalabari) and Auni Ati (5km west of Kamalabari), where monks are keen to
show you their little museum (Indian/foreigner ₹10/50, camera/video ₹50/200; h9.30-11am
& 12-4pm) of Ahom royal artefacts. The best chances of observing chanting, dances or drama recitations are around dawn and dusk or during the big Ras Mahotsav Festival (hNov), in celebration of the birth, life and feats of Krishna.
Majuli Tourism (%9435657282; jyoti24365@gmail.com; full-day tour ₹500, bicycle hire per

8 Getting There & Away Ferries (adult/4WD ₹20/600, 1½ hours) leave Nimatighat in Jorhat for Majuli Island at 8.30am, 10.30am, 1.30pm and 3pm; return trips are at 7.30am, 8.30am, 1.30pm and 3pm. Departures depend on tidal conditions and season.
8 Getting Around Jam-packed buses/vans (₹20/30) meet arriving ferries at the pier then drive to Garamur via Kamalabari. For long stays, consider arranging a bicycle (₹100) through Majuli Tourism.
SATRAS
A satra is a monastery for Vishnu worship, Assam’s distinctive form of everyman Hinduism. Formulated by 15th-century Assamese philosopher Sankardev, the faith eschews the caste system and idol worship, focusing on Vishnu as God, especially in his Krishna incarnation. Much of the worship is based around dance and melodramatic play- acting of scenes from the holy Bhagavad Gita. The heart of any satra is its namghar (a large, simple, prayer hall), housing an eternal flame, the Gita and possibly a horde of instructive (but not divine) images. Traditionally, satras have also patronised the elegantly choreographed Satriya dance form and the folk-performing-arts tradition of Ankiya Bhawna, in which masked dancers play out tales from Hindu mythology.

%03772 / Pop 53,800
Once the capital of the Ahom dynasty, sleepy Sivasagar (literally ‘waters of Shiva’) takes its name from the graceful central reservoir in the heart of town, commissioned by the Ahom Queen Ambika in 1734. Three typical Ahom temple towers rise proudly above the tank’s partly wooded southern banks – to the west Devidol, to the east Vishnudol and in the centre, the 33m-high Shivadol Mandir.
Around 500m from Shivadol, a gaggle of hotels line AT Rd, the most appealing of which is the freshly renovated Hotel Shiva Palace (%03772-
222629; hotelshivapalace.1811@rediffmail.com; AT Rd; s/d from ₹900/1000; a), incorporating a
decent restaurant, the Sky Chef Restaurant (AT Rd; mains ₹160).
About 1.5km along Bhuban Gogoi (BG) Rd stands Hotel Siddhartha

Rang Ghar & Talatalghar
The famous Ahom ruins of Sivasagar are located about 4km down AT Rd from Sivasagar. First up along your way is the elegant Rang Ghar (Indian/foreigner₹5/100; hdawn-dusk), a two-storey oval-shaped pavilion from where Ahom monarchs once watched buffalo and elephant fights in an arena that’s now been converted into a manicured garden.
Past Rang Ghar along AT Rd, a left turning passes the barrack-shaped Golaghar (Ahom ammunition store). Beyond are the ruins of Talatalghar (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; hdawn-dusk), an expansive, two-storey Ahom palace built by Ahom King Rajeswar Singha in the mid-18th century.

PALACE
Dramatic if largely unadorned, this 1752 brick palace is the last remnant of the Ahom’s pre-Sivasagar capital. The unique four-storey structure rises like a sharpened, stepped pyramid above an attractive forest-and-paddy setting. It’s about 15km along the Sivasagar–Sonari highway down a village road: turn left just before Gargaon.
Dibrugarh
%0373 / Pop 137,600
Cheerful and clement Dibrugarh, Assam’s original tea city, usefully closes a loop between Kaziranga National Park and the Ziro–Along–Pasighat route in Arunachal Pradesh. It is also the terminus (or starting point) for the fascinating ferry ride along the Brahmaputra River to Pasighat.
Hotel Little Palace (%0373-2328700; www.hotellp.com; AT Rd; s/d from ₹800/950;

From Mohanbari airport, 16km northeast of Dibrugarh and 4km off the Tinsukia road, Air India and Jet Airways fly to Guwahati, Kolkata and Delhi, while IndiGo flies to Guwahati.
From the main bus station (Mancotta Rd), both ASTC and private buses depart for Sivasagar (₹90, two hours, frequent 6am to 9am), Jorhat (₹170, three hours, frequent 6am to 9am), Tezpur (₹390, six hours, hourly 6am to 6pm) and Guwahati (₹490, 10 hours, hourly 6am to 8am and 8pm to 10pm). There’s also an AC Volvo service to Guwahati (₹690, eight hours, 9.45pm).
From the train station in the town centre, the overnight 12423 Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express leaves for Guwahati (3AC/2AC ₹1150/1560, 10 hours) at
8.35pm.
Rough-and-ready ferries (per person ₹60, vehicle ₹1000; hhourly 9am to 3pm) cruise
daily to Bogibil Ghat on the Arunachal side of the Brahmaputra River, where they are met by a bus to Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh. Cheekily challenging the basic laws of floatation, the rickety steamboats carry two 4WDs, a few dozen motorcycles and an army of humans. There’s little shelter and the journey takes around 1½ hours, so bring shades, water and sunscreen. Exact departure times depend on the Brahmaputra’s water level. During the dry season, ferries cruise further upstream to Majer Ghat or Oiram Ghat, which can take up to five hours. Many hotels in Dibrugarh sell 4WD-ferry-4WD combination tickets (per person ₹300) for travel to Pasighat.
NORTHEAST PERMITS & TOURS
The Northeast States are a fascinating melting pot of tribal cultures, but currently foreigners can only access Arunachal Pradesh with a Protected Area Permit (PAP) from the Indian government, which is usually only granted if you are travelling in a group. Permits are only issued through registered travel agents, meaning that even if you plan to travel independently, you will have to approach a tour operator to process the PAP for you. In practice, almost everyone joins a tour because of the difficulties of dealing with local officials and avoiding political unrest and insurgent groups without a guide who speaks the local language.
Th      l     i     th    N   th      t         t  t       h
llN      ldMi           dThe rules in other Northeastern states change regularly. Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram enjoy 'permit free’ status as of 2015, but the situation can easily change. Check ahead before you travel to any of the Northeast States.
Here is an overview of the regulations at the time of writing: Minimum group size Permit applications need a two-person minimum group. It’s possible for single travellers to get a permit, but only if you use a tour company, who will add staff to make up the numbers.
Permit requirements An application for a permit must be accompanied by a cover letter, photocopies of passport and valid visa, two passport-size photographs and a
US$50 processing fee.
Validity Permits are valid for 30 days from a specified starting date. If you wish to overstay, you have to apply for a fresh permit. Permits only allow you to visit specified districts between specified dates; plan your itinerary carefully. Make multiple photocopies of your permit to hand in at each checkpoint, police station and hotel.
Where to apply Permits are issued at the state secretariat in Itanagar, which accepts applications only from reputed and registered travel agencies. Ergo, you must go through a tour operator even if you plan to travel independently in the region afterward. Some agents nowadays offer to secure permits for independent travellers for an additional fee.
Registration In every state, foreigners are technically required to register at the nearest police station upon their arrival in any state capital.
TOUR COMPANIES
While joining a tour might seem restrictive, tour agents are highly experienced in dealing with permit red tape and negotiating with local officials, and will also help you bridge language barriers in a way that would be almost impossible if you were travelling independently. Indeed, it would be very difficult to have any meaningful encounters with tribal people without a local go-between to explain the proper etiquette. A tour agent will also help you steer clear of insurgent hotspots.

ARUNACHAL PRADESH
The final frontier of Indian tourism, virginal Arunachal Pradesh shows up as a giant patch of unexplored green on the country’s map. India’s wildest and least explored state, Arunachal (literally the ‘Land of Dawn-lit Mountains’) rises abruptly from the Assam plains as a mass of densely forested, and impossibly steep, hills, which eventually top off as snow-capped peaks along the Tibetan border. Home to 26 indigenous tribes, Arunachal is perhaps the last sanctuary for India’s natural and anthropological heritage. Much of the state still remains beyond tourism’s reach, but new areas (comprising lush river gorges and craggy mountainscapes) are slowly being opened to visitors.
China has never formally recognised Indian sovereignty here and it took theChina has never formally recognised Indian sovereignty here, and it took the surprise Chinese invasion of 1962 for Delhi to really start funding significant infrastructure (the Chinese voluntarily withdrew). These days, border passes are heavily guarded by the Indian military but the atmosphere is generally calm. Compared to its neighbours, Arunachal has been relatively untouched by political violence, but Naga rebels continue to be active in the far northeast of the state, along the borders with Nagaland and Myanmar.

NAMDAPHA NATIONAL PARK
The staggering Namdapha National Park (%03807-222249;
www.changlang.nic.in/namdapha.html; Indian/foreigner ₹10/50, camera ₹75-400, video ₹750), spread over 1985 sq km of dense forest in far eastern Arunachal Pradesh, is an ecological hotspot with a mind-boggling array of animal and plant species and habitats ranging from warm tropical plains to icy Himalayan highlands. Namdapha is famous for being the only park in India to have four big cat species (leopard, tiger, clouded leopard and snow leopard). It’s also a birdwatcher’s delight, with around 500 recorded species.
The park is a long haul from anywhere, and visiting can be a pain unless you’re travelling with a tour operator. Aborcountry Travels & Expeditions has a good grasp of these jungles.
The gateway to Namdapha is Dibrugarh in Assam, from where you need to travel about 150km to get to the small town of Miao. From here it’s a 26km drive to Deban, where the park headquarters are located. Simple accommodation is available in Miao at the Eco- Tourist Guest House (%03807-222296; Miao; per person Indian/foreigner ₹400/600), or in Deban at the Forest Rest House (%03807-222249; Deban; d Indian/foreigner ₹190/380).
Itanagar
%0360 / Pop 35,000
Arunachal’s capital takes its name from the mysterious Ita Fort, the brick ruins of which crown a hilltop above the rapidly booming town. A concrete-fest of sorts, this somewhat characterless urban hub merely serves as the state’s power centre (your travel permits for Arunachal are issued here). There’s a stack of ATMs and internet cafes along Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Marg.
The few sights in town include the decent but shoddily curated JawaharlalNehru State Museum (Indian/foreigner ₹10/75, camera/video ₹20/100; h9.30am-4pm Sun-
Thu), and the brightly coloured gompa (Tibetan Buddhist monastery) of the Centre for Buddhist Culture set in the gardens nearby.

A new railway line now connects Naharlagun, about 12km east of Itanagar, to the rest of Northeast India, but regular services may only begin by late 2015.
Itanagar is also serviced by the Naharlagun helipad, which has daily flights (except Sunday) to Guwahati (₹4000). Ask your hotel reception or tour operator for tickets.
Central Arunachal Pradesh
For intrepid types, Central Arunachal Pradesh promises some great adventures, from tribal encounters in the picturesque Ziro Valley to rafting on the Siang River and thrilling treks to remote settlements, such as Mechuka.
ARUNACHAL’S TRIBAL GROUPS
An astonishing patchwork quilt of ethnic populations, Arunachal is home to some 26 different tribal groups, including the Adi (Abor), Nishi, Tagin, Galo, Apatani and Monpapeople. Many tribes are related to each other, while some consider themselves unique. Modernity is slowly making inroads into the local society, but most tribes straddle the
boundary between old and new – it’s not uncommon to see a modern concrete building outfitted with a traditional open-hearth kitchen over stilted bamboo flooring.
The traditional animistic religion of Donyi-Polo (sun and moon worship) is still prevalent in the region, although Christian missionaries have had a significant impact on the religious beliefs and way of life in this area. For ceremonial occasions, village chiefs typically wear scarlet shawls and a bamboo wicker hat spiked with porcupine quills or hornbill beaks. Women favour hand-woven wraparounds like Southeast Asian sarongs, while some of the older men still wear their hair long, with a topknot above their foreheads. The artistic traditions of weaving and wickerwork are very much alive in these hills.
Architecture varies from tribe to tribe – traditional Adi villages are generally the most photogenic, with luxuriant palmyra-leaf thatching and wobbly bamboo suspension bridges strung across river gorges.
Ziro Valley
%03788
One of the prettiest landscapes in all of India, the fertile Ziro Valley nestles within Arunachal's formidable mountainscape like a mythical kingdom. A layered landscape of rice fields, rivers and picture-postcard villages of the Apatani tribe, it is an undisputed high point of any trip to Arunachal.
Scenery and village architecture apart, the main attraction here is meeting the friendly older Apatani folk who sport facial tattoos and nose plugs to rival any tattoo artist back home. The most authentic Apatani villages are Hong (the biggest and best known), Hija (more atmospheric), Hari, Bamin and Duta; none of which are more than 10km apart. It’s vital to have a local guide to take you to any of these villages, otherwise you won’t see much and might even be made to feel quite unwelcome.
For four days in September, Ziro is invaded by thousands of music lovers who come to attend the Ziro Music Festival (www.zirofestival.com; hSep), which showcases the best of regional music as well as a great selection of bands from across India.
Sprawling Hapoli (New Ziro), about 7km south of Ziro, has basic urban infrastructure and road transport. Just below the Commissioner’s Office, on abend in MG Rd, is an SBI ATM.

It runs a string of comfortable and thoroughly atmospheric homestays with friendly and hospitable hosts – an evening treat of local rice beer and smoked beef often comes free. Ngunu Ziro also provides guides (₹1000) and bicycles (₹500) for village tours.
For a memorable homestay experience (and a sampling of superb home cooked food), you could also consider a night or two at the lovely Abasa
Homestay (%9402709164; Siiro Village; per person incl half board ₹1000), run by the friendly

Sumos depart from Hapoli, on MG Rd near the SBI ATM, for Itanagar (₹320, five hours, 5am and 11am), Lakhimpur (₹310, four hours, hourly 7am to 9am) and Daporijo (₹420, six hours, around 9.30am). A new airport, if completed by its 2016 deadline, should handle flights to Guwahati and Dibrugarh.
MEET THE APATANI
Numbering around 25,000 and native to the Ziro Valley, the Apatani are one of Northeast India’s most intriguing tribes. Believed to have migrated to the valley from the less hospitable northern highlands, the Apatanis are strongly rooted to their ancient culture. Most people are adherents of the animistic Donyi-Polo (sun-and-moon worship) religion, and continue to live in traditional houses fabricated out of bamboo and wood (the interiors are considerably modern though). Apatani villages are immensely photogenic, with T-shaped totem poles called babos towering over rows of huts that line every thoroughfare. Farmers by occupation, the Apatani practice a unique system of agriculture, where terraced rice fields are flooded with water to double as shallow fish farms. Apatanis also excel in arts such as weaving and wicker work.
Historically famous for their beauty, Apatani women were often kidnapped by warriors of the neighbouring Nishi tribes. As a ‘defence’, Apatani girls were deliberately defacedwith facial tattoos and extraordinary nose plugs known as dat, fitted into holes cut in their upper nostrils. Peace with the Nishis in the 1960s meant an end to the brutal practice, and only a few surviving locals from the older generations can now be seen wearing dat. Photography is a sensitive issue, so always ask first.
Ziro to Pasighat
Passing through a most pristine landscape marked by forested hills and tribal settlements, the highway linking Ziro to Pasighat via Along offers great photo- ops of dizzying suspension footbridges and thatched Adi villages. Tourism is low key in this rough and remote area and villagers are likely to be more welcoming if you visit with a local tour guide.
Daporijo
%03792 Pop 15,700 Elev 700m
A necessary stopover midway along the long drive from Ziro to Pasighat, Daporijo is dirty, characterless and unsophisticated. However, its riverside location on the banks of the Subansiri River gives you the option of a few walks and hikes. Start early from Itanagar, and you’ll be here by lunch. Hotel
Singhik (%03792-223103; singhikhotel@gmail.com; d from ₹1700; aW), a new and
surprisingly comfortable hotel with colourful interiors, an excellent restaurant and free wi-fi, is the best place to stop for the night. Otherwise, you could spend the night in the traditional thatched village of Ligu (coming from Ziro take the left turning just before the bridge at the entrance to Daporijo), where you’ll find the basic but delightful Ligu Tourist Resort (%03792-223114; r ₹1000). The proprietor’s family cooks up fantastic meals.
Sumos leave New Market in the town centre at 6am for Itanagar (₹570, 12 hours) and Ziro (₹320, six hours).

Eastern Infotech Cyber Cafe (Nehru Chowk; per hr ₹50; h8am-6pm Mon-Sat) opposite
the APST bus station and an SBI ATM (Main Rd). Next to the Circuit House, also on Main Rd, is an informative little district museum (h10am-4pm Mon-Fri).
The saving grace of Along is the well-kept Hotel West (%03783-222566;

comfortable rooms, good service and a central location. Hotel Toshi Palace
(%9436638196; Rime Market; d from ₹700; a), opposite the APST bus station, has clean
rooms and a pleasant terrace restaurant where beers flow freely after sundown. There are Sumos to Itanagar (₹610, 14 hours, 5.30am) and Pasighat (₹270,
five hours, 5.30am and 11.30am).
Of the many Adi villages around Along, Kabu and Pobdi (2km and 7km north of town respectively) are best known and most easily accessible. It’s easier to secure entry in the company of a local guide, and you can observe the Adis slowly warming to modernity (heralded by zippy cars and the ubiquitous satellite TV dish outside most huts) from a much closer range.
There are many more interesting and less-visited Adi villages along the onward journey to Pasighat. The top sight, however, is a wobbly, cable-trussed bamboo-decked suspension bridge running almost 200m across the Siang River.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
MECHUKA
For intrepid travellers, the drive from Along to Mechuka – a remote outpost very close to the Tibetan border – qualifies as one of the most enthralling road trips in Arunachal Pradesh. Recently opened for tourism by the government, Mechuka often goes by the moniker of ‘forbidden valley’ or the ‘last Shangri La’ – indeed, until recently, the only way to reach the village was on foot. Populated by the Buddhist Memba tribe, this tiny village sitting on the banks of the Siang River is notable for both the 400-year-old Samten Yongcha Monastery and the stunning landscapes surrounding the town, which culminate in a massive hulk of snow-draped mountains running along the border.
Sumos ply the 180km from Along (₹470, seven hours, 5.30am). Unless you are able to find accommodations with a local family, the only accommodation is the government Circuit House, which rents out rooms on an ad hoc basis (and tariff). Remember that bookings can be overriden by visiting government officials.Pasighat
%0368 / Pop 21,900
Laid out along forested plains by the banks of the Siang River, Pasighat feels more like Assam than Arunachal Pradesh. The town hosts the interesting Adi festival of Solung (h1-5 Sep), marked by rituals performed to seek agricultural prosperity and protection from evil spirits. Through the rest of the year, the most interesting sight around here is the sunrise over the Siang.
Most tourists passing through Pasighat sleep at Hotel Aane (%0368-2222777; MG Rd; d from ₹1400; a), which has floral shades adorning its walls, clean sheets, and a good in-house restaurant. The friendly and centrally located Hotel Oman (%0368-2900430; Main Market; d/tr ₹1050/1600) is a tad cheaper, but there’s no hot water and you’ll have to traipse to the market for meals.
For a more rewarding stay, head 25km south of Pasighat along NH52 to Oyan village, where you can spend a few days lounging amid lush tea gardens at the
Siang Tea Garden Lodge (%9436675824; Oyan Village; per person incl full board ₹2500;
W), which has simple but comfy rooms with ethnic decor, garden-fresh tea and awesome food prepared by Babul, the in-house chef. Contact Aborcountry Travels & Expeditions for bookings.
There’s an internet cafe (MG Rd; per hr ₹60; h7.30am-8pm) 50m from Hotel Aane
and an ATM near the Sumo stand in the central market area.
Sumos run to Along (₹270, five hours, 6am and noon) and Itanagar (₹370, eight hours, 6am), as well as Tuting (₹980) when demand warrants it. Ferries (per person/vehicle ₹60/1000) drift lazily down the Brahmaputra to Dibrugarh in Assam from Bogibil Ghat, and from Oiram Ghat and Majerbari Ghat during the dry season (Sumos take one hour from Pasighat, depart at 6am and cost ₹140). Ferry tickets are sold by agents at the Sumo stand in town.

TUTING & PEMAKO
In the far north of Arunachal lies the isolated region of Tuting, visited yearly by a handful of pilgrims and hardcore adventure seekers. Accessible from Pasighat by a long rough road, it sits near the Tibetan border, where the Tsang Po River, having left the Tibetang
g
Plateau and burrowed through the Himalayas via a series of spectacular gorges, enters the Indian subcontinent and becomes the Siang (which in turn becomes the Brahmaputra in Assam). Steadily gaining a reputation as a thrilling white-water rafting destination, the perilous 180km route is littered with grade 4 to 5 rapids, strong eddies and inaccessible gorges. Needless to say, this is the stuff of pros.
Tuting also serves as the launchpad for the fabulous land of Pemako, known in Buddhist legend as a hidden earthly paradise and the earthly representation of Dorje Pagmo (a Tibetan goddess). This isolated mountain valley is populated by Memba Buddhists, who are almost completely isolated from the rest of the world. Pemako is accessible to those willing to endure days of incredibly tough hiking (and permit hassles) – in practice, most visitors are Buddhist pilgrims.
If you do manage to get here, consider kicking back for a few nights at Yamne Abor (%9436053870; Damro Village; per person incl full board ₹2500), a lovely resort comprising a mix of luxury tents and eco-cottages in the remote Yamne valley amid pretty Adi villages, rice fields and verdant forests.

Western Arunachal Pradesh
After two full days of hobbling along what could easily be called the worst road in the world, you will emerge into a humbling landscape of magnificent blue mountains guarding the ancient city of Tawang, the archetypal Shangri La. The most important sight in Western Arunachal Pradesh, Tawang is inhabited by the Monpa, a tribal people who are culturally closer to Tibet than to their neighbours in the lowlands of Arunachal. Ideally budget at least one week for a return trip from Guwahati (or Tezpur), breaking the journey each way with a full day in Dirang or Bomdila. Be prepared for intense cold and snow in winter, and vehicular breakdowns and roads being blocked by landslides at any time of the year.

stone village. The main road separates its rocky mini citadel from a huddle of
picturesque streamside houses above which rises a steep ridge topped by a
timeless gompa (Tibetan Buddhist monastery). Heading the other way, just
north of New Dirang, the valley opens out and its floor becomes a patchwork of
rice and crop fields through which gushes the icy blue Dirang River.
All of Dirang’s commercial services are in New Dirang, with a strip of cheap
eateries and Sumo counters around the central crossroads. Hotel Pemaling

zigzags which cross several army camps and landslide zones to finally top off at
Se La, an icy 4176m pass that breaches the mountains and provides access to
Tawang. From here, the road plummets down the mountainside into the belly of
Tawang Valley.
Tawang Valley%03794 / Elev 3050m
A mighty gash in the earth fringed by hulking mountains, the Tawang Valley works a special magic on the minds of travellers. The valley is a gorgeous patchwork of mountain ridges, vast fields and clusters of Buddhist monasteries and Monpa villages. Autumn is a particularly beautiful season for travelling this route, when waterfalls are in spate and cosmos shrubs lining the tarmac come alive with a riotous blossom of red and pink.
Tawang town is a transport hub and service centre for the valley’s villages, plus there are a number of small hotels, but the setting is more beautiful than the town itself. Nonetheless, murals of auspicious Buddhist emblems and colourful prayer wheels add interest to the central old market area. The prayer wheels are turned by a stream of Monpa pilgrims, many of whom sport traditional black yak-wool gurdam (skullcaps that look like giant Rastafarian spiders).

Tawang Gompa
(camera/video ₹20/100; hdawn-dusk)
MONASTERY
Tawang’s biggest attraction is the magical Tawang Gompa, backdropped by snow-speckled peaks. Founded in 1681, this medieval citadel is reputedly the world’s second-largest Buddhist monastery complex after Lhasa’s Potala Palace and famed in Buddhist circles for its library. Within its fortified walls, narrow alleys lead up to the majestic and magnificently decorated prayer hall containing an 8m-high statue of Buddha Shakyamuni. Across the central square is a small but interesting museum containing images, robes, telescopic trumpets and some personal items of the sixth Dalai Lama.
Come here at dawn (4am to 5am) to see monks performing their early- morning prayers. Spectacular masked chaam dances are held in the monastery courtyard during the Torgya, Losar and Buddha Mahotsava festivals.

NAGALAND
The uncontested ‘wild east’ of India, Nagaland is probably one of the reasons you came to the Northeast in the first place. A place of primeval beauty,Nagaland’s dazzling hills and valleys – right on the edge of the India–Myanmar border – are an otherworldly place where, until very recently, some 16-odd headhunting Naga tribes valiantly fought off any intruders. Of course, Nagaland today is a shadow of its once savage self, and much of the south of the state is fairly developed. In the north, however, you still stand a good chance of meeting tribesmen in exotic attire who continue to live a lifestyle that is normally only seen within the pages of a National Geographic magazine. Note that a number of insurgent groups are active in the state and you should check the political situation before you travel.
DRY STATES
Nagaland is officially a dry state (as are Manipur and Mizoram) – the sale and purchase of alcohol is prohibited by law, at least on paper. Authorities don’t seem to mind minor amounts of booze being brought in for personal consumption.
Dimapur

Of the central hotels, the new Hotel Acacia (%8415935254; www.hotelacacia.in; d from ₹1200; aW) is the smartest option, with mint-fresh rooms, speedy wi-fi, prompt service and good in-house food. You’ll find it opposite East Police Station.

THE HISTORY OF HEADHUNTING
Long feared for their ferocity in war and their sense of independence, Naga tribes considered headhunting a sign of strength and machismo. Every intervillage war saw the victors lopping off the heads of the vanquished and instantly rising in social stature (as well as in the eyes of women). Among certain tribes such as the Konyaks of Mon, men who claimed heads were adorned with face tattoos and V-shaped marks on their torsos, in addition to being allowed to wear brass pendants called yanra denoting the number of heads the wearer had taken.
Headhunting was outlawed in 1953 (the last recorded occurrence was in 1963). Much of the credit for the change, however, goes to Christian missionaries in the region who preached non-violence and peaceful coexistence over decades. Almost 90% of the Nagas now consider themselves Christian, their unshakeable faith marked by behemoth- like churches that are a prominent landmark in any settlement. Now seen as immoral possessions, most hamlets have gotten rid of their grisly human trophies.

Around Kohima
Kisama
Kisama Heritage Village
AREA
 
Kisama Heritage Village has a representative selection of traditional Naga houses and morungs (bachelor dormitories) with full-size log drums. Nagaland’s biggest annual festival, the Hornbill Festival is celebrated here. Within the premises is the WWII Museum (admission ₹10; h10am-4pm), which has a collection of war memorabilia. Kisama is 10km from central Kohima along the Imphal road.Kigwema
A 10-minute drive past Kisama along Imphal road brings you to Kigwema, an
Angami village of historic importance where Japanese forces arrived and set up
camp before the final showdown with Allied Forces in 1944. Several households
here welcome tourists (preferably accompanied by local guides) and you can get
a peek into the daily lives of resident tribespeople.
Khonoma
This historic Angami-Naga village was the site of two major British–Angami
siege battles in 1847 and 1879. Built on an easily defended ridge, Khonoma
looks beautifully traditional, with emerald paddy patchworks carpeting valley
floors between towering ridges. There are a few simple homestay options in the
village.
Tuophema
Forty-five kilometres north of Kohima is the village of Tuophema, en route to Mon. The highlight here is the Tuophema Tourist Village (%9436005002; d ₹1500), where you sleep in comfortable traditionally styled Naga thatched huts, and eat traditional food in a glass-paned cafeteria (meals ₹200). Notify them of your arrival in advance or it will probably be closed.
Kohima to Mon
The scenic but but insufferably bumpy road from Kohima to Mon passes through beautiful forested hills, at one point briefly entering Assam. A convenient stopover en route is Mokokchung, a laid-back town with a spectacular hillside
setting. The spiffy Hotel Metsuben (%0369-2229343; metsuben@yahoo.com; off Kohima
Rd; d from ₹850; aiW) is the best place to look for a bed, and a range of hearty and fiery Naga dishes.
Northern NagalandNo t  e     Naga a  d
The most unspoiled part of the state, Northern Nagaland is a rugged and divinely beautiful country where antiquity still thrives in tribal villages composed of thatched longhouses, many of whose inhabitants continue to live a fairly traditional hunting and farming lifestyle. The most accessible villages are the Konyak settlements around Mon (where traditional houses abound). Some villages still have morungs and religious relics from pre-Christian times. Village elders may wear traditional costumes and Konyaks of all ages carry the fearsome-looking dao – a crude machete (originally used for headhunting) as a standard accessory.
Visiting a Naga village without a local guide is hopelessly unproductive. You’d also do well to have your own sturdy vehicle, as there’s virtually no public transport and roads are atrocious.
Mon & Around
The haggard hill town of Mon merely serves as an access point for the many Konyak villages in the area. There’s an SBI ATM in town which rarely works.
Of the numerous tribal villages in the area, the most popular is Longwa, about 35km from Mon, where the headman’s longhouse spectacularly straddles the India–Myanmar border and contains a fascinating range of weapons, dinosaur- like totems and a WWII metal aircraft seat salvaged from debris scattered in nearby jungles. You can spend some time at a local house here and several tattooed former headhunters can be photographed for a fairly standard ₹100 fee. Tribal jewellery, carved masks and other collectibles (₹200 to ₹1000) can also be bought from many households. In the high season, the village charges a per person entry fee of ₹200.
Other villages that can be visited from Mon include Old Mon (5km), with countless animal skulls adorning the walls of the headman’s house; Singha Chingnyu (20km), which has a huge longhouse decorated with animal skulls and three stuffed tigers; and Shangnyu (25km), with a friendly headman and a wooden shrine full of fertility references.
The only decent hotel in Mon itself is the scrappy but friendly Helsa Cottage (%9862345965; d from ₹1000) run by the influential, affable Aunty.Running water and electricity are seldom your companions here, but the food is tasty. Aunty also co-manages the Helsa Resort (%9436000028; d from ₹1000), slightly out of town en route to Longwa, which has six traditional thatched Konyak huts with springy bamboo floors, sparse furnishings and hot water by the bucket. Meals can be arranged upon prior request.
Shared 4WDs bounce painfully to Dimapur (₹380, 12 hours, 3pm) and Sonari in Assam (₹90, 6am and 9am), where you can change for Jorhat. No public transport leaves Mon on the weekend.
SAFE TRAVEL IN THE NORTHEAST STATES
In recent decades, many ethno-linguistic groups in the Northeast have jostled – often violently – to assert themselves in the face of illegal immigration from neighbouring countries, governmental apathy and a heavy-handed defence policy. Some want independence from India, others autonomy, but most are fighting what are effectively clan or turf wars. While peace mostly prevails, trouble in these regions can flare up suddenly and unpredictably. In 2010 bombings hit parts of Assam and the Garo Hills area of Meghalaya. Ethnic violence erupted in Assam, while a bomb blast and curfews shattered the veneer of peace in Manipur in late 2012. In December 2014, strikes by Bodo groups killed more than 70 people across Assam. To make things worse, Assam and Manipur are often paralysed by strikes and shutdowns. It pays to keep abreast of the latest headlines on TV and in local papers. If you’re with a tour group, talk to the operators to make sure your guide is up to date with the latest situation.
MANIPUR
A breeding ground for graceful classical dance traditions, intricate art forms, sumptuous cuisine and (supposedly) the sport of polo, Manipur sits pretty amid rolling hills along India’s border with Myanmar. This ‘Jewelled Land’ is home to Thadou, Tangkhul, Paite, Kuki, Mao Naga and many other tribal peoples, but the predominant community is the Hindu Meitei tribe, who adhere to a neo- Vaishnavite order. Much of the state is carpeted with dense forests which provide cover for rare birds, drug traffickers and guerrilla armies, making it by far the Northeast’s most dangerous state.
Foreign travellers are currently restricted to Imphal and its outskirts, an area which is deemed ‘safe’. Most foreigners fly into Imphal; it is also possible to d i    i  f       K hi     (N     l   d)     Sil h    (A       ) if       h             iddrive in from Kohima (Nagaland) or Silchar (Assam) if you have a guide.
Travelling east of Kakching towards the Myanmar border is not permitted.
REGISTERING ON ARRIVAL IN MANIPUR
On arrival at Imphal airport, all foreigners must register with the police stationed next to the luggage collection point. You must then register again with the CID at the main police station (%0385-2220002; Thangal Bazaar) in Imphal town. In both cases it’s a fairly painless affair (assuming your passport and visa are in order). If you’re travelling by road, you must register at the security checkpoint on the state border.

LOKTAK LAKE
A most intriguing and picturesque ecosystem if there ever was one, the fascinating Loktak Lake is one of the few places a foreigner is allowed to visit outside Imphal. A shimmering blue lake broken up into small lakelets by (rapidly vanishing) clumps of thick matted weeds called phumdis, the lake is inhabited by local villagers who build thatched huts on these floating ‘islands’ and make their way about the lake in dugout canoes. More peculiar than floating villages are the large, perfectly circular fishing ponds created out of floating rings of weeds. The best view is atop Sendra Island (admission ₹15). You can embark on a boat ride (per person ₹20) in order to get a closer look at lake life. The lake is 45km by road from Imphal; a return taxi costs about ₹2200.
MIZORAM
Seated precariously along rows of north–south-running mountain ridges, pristine Mizoram is more of an experiential journey than a tourist destination. Ethnically, the majority of the local population shares similarities with communities in neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Myanmar (Burma), and the predominant religion is Christianity. Mizo culture is liberated from caste or gender distinctions: in Aizawl girls smoke openly, wear modern clothes and hang out in unchaperoned posses meeting up with their beaus at rock concerts.
Mizoram runs to its own rhythm. Most businesses open early and shut by 6pm; virtually everything closes tight on Sunday. Upon arrival, you must register at the Office of the Superintendent of Police (%0389-2335339; CID
Office, Bungkawn; h10am-4pm Mon-Sat) in Aizawl. Domestic tourists require a

TRIPURA
Far from India’s popular tourist circuits, Tripura is a culturally charming place which thrives on the hope that its handful of royal palaces and temples will draw the world's attention some day. For the moment, though, foreign travellers remain very rare, despite the fact that no permit is currently required. The state can be accessed by land from Meghalaya or Bangladesh; if you fly in, you must register with the police on arrival at the airport.Agartala
%0381 / Pop 189,900
Tripura’s only ‘city’, this low-key settlement with its semi-rural atmosphere feels like an India of yore. It’s a congested but relaxed place, and in many ways feels more like a small town than a state capital. The pace of life is slow, and the people are friendly.Agartala

Around Agartala
Udaipur
%03821
Udaipur was Tripura’s historic capital and remains dotted with ancient temples and tanks. The main sight here is the Tripura Sundari Mandir (Matabari;
h4.30am-1.30pm & 3.30-9.30pm), a 1501 Kali temple where a steady stream of
pilgrims make almost endless animal sacrifices that leave the grounds as bloody as the temple’s vivid-red sikhara (spire). Even more people come here during the Diwali festival (October/November) to bathe in the fish-filled tank by the temple. The temple is 100m east of the NH44, 4km south of Udaipur, which has bus connections to Agartala (₹50, two hours) and Melaghar (₹30, 45 minutes). An autorickshaw from Udaipur costs ₹50.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK UNAKOTIUNAKOTI
Located about 150km from Agartala, the archaeological site of Unakoti is one of Northeast India’s best-kept travel secrets. Massive rock-cut sculptures of Hindu gods and goddesses (some dating back to the 7th century) adorn the faces of hillocks at the site, including a 10m-tall face of Shiva sculpted on a monolithic rock, and a trio of Ganeshas hewn in stone beneath a waterfall. To get here, it’s best to hire a taxi from Agartala (₹2800) and organise a day trip. Bring your own food and water.
Neermahal & Melaghar
%0381
Tripura’s most iconic building, the Neermahal (admission ₹5, camera/video ₹10/25;
h8.30am-4pm, to 4.30pm Apr-Sep), is a gorgeous red-and-white water palace, empty but shimmering on its own boggy island in the lake of Rudra Sagar. Like its counterpart in Rajasthan’s Udaipur, this was a princely exercise in aesthetics; Tripuran king Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman hired the finest craftsmen to construct his lavish summer palace in a blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles. The pavilion was christened by the Bengali Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in 1930.
The delightful waterborne approach by speed boat (passenger/boat ₹20/400) or fancy rowboat (passenger/boat ₹20/100) is the most enjoyable part of visiting. Boats leave from a pier beside the remarkably decent Sagarmahal Tourist Lodge (%9436185313; d from ₹900; a), where most rooms have lake-facing balconies, and there's a good restaurant presiding downstairs.
Melaghar has bus connections to Agartala (₹50, two hours) through the morning and afternoon.
MEGHALAYA
Separating the Assam valley from the plains of Bangladesh, hilly Meghalaya – the ‘abode of clouds’ – is a cool, pine-fresh mountain state set on dramatic horseshoes of rocky cliffs. Cherrapunjee and Mawsynram are statistically among the wettest places on earth; most of the rain falls between June and September, creating very impressive waterfalls and carving out some of Asia’s longest caves.The state's population predominantly comprises the Jaintia, Khasi and Garo tribes, who live in the eastern, central and western parts respectively. A good time to be in Meghalaya is during the Wangala festival in the Garo Hills in autumn. No permits were required for Meghalaya at time of writing.
Shillong
%0364 / Pop 267,600
Irreverent Shillong was the capital of British-created Assam until 1972. Since becoming the state capital of Meghalaya, it has rapidly developed into a typical modern Indian town, but still retains some its colonial-era charm in certain pockets. Overhauled cars are all the rage here – take a ride in one of Shillong's many taxis and you'll know.Shillong

GARO & JAINTIA HILLS
Far from well-trodden tracks, lush Garo Hills in the far west of Meghalaya is worth exploring if you have a few days (and a sense of adventure) to spare. Easier to reach from Guwahati than Shillong, its main urban hub is the tiny settlement of Tura, where the friendly tourist office (%03651-242394; h10am-4pm Mon-Fri) can arrange local guides. Buses run here from Guwahati and accommodation is available at the Rikman Continental (%03651-220744; www.hotelrikman.com; Circular Rd; s/d incl breakfast from
₹1200/1500; aW), which has a mix of standard and semi-luxury rooms.
For most people, a visit to Garo Hills involves an encounter with the endangered Hoolock gibbon, a friendly primate that lives in the forests of the Nokrek Biosphere Reserve. The other highlight of the region is an excursion to tribal villages deep in the mountains, where you can see villagers practise the ancient slash-and-burn method of jhum cultivation. Intriguing borangs (traditional tree houses) dot the lush landscape around here. If you're with a reliable local guide, it's also possible to visit a traditional Garo village and sample their rice-beer-soaked hospitality. Remember to leave a tip in return. In autumn Garo Hills hosts the four-day Wangala festival (hOct/Nov), renowned for its impressive tribal dancing and traditional drum recitals.
The Jaintia Hills, meanwhile, is home to the village of Nartiang, where you can visit an intriguing complex of stone monoliths erected by different clans between the 16th and 19th centuries. It's unattended and overgrown – beware of snakes in the undergrowth. Nartiang is located 62km southeast of Shillong, and can be visited on a day trip by hiring a taxi (₹1600).
Cherrapunjee (Sohra)
%03637 / Pop 10,100
Laid out along razorlike ridges of a high mountain wall, Cherrapunjee sits on the edge of the Himalayas, overlooking the pancake-flat plains of Bangladesh. The village was once feted as the wettest place on earth because of the prodigious monsoon rainfall. The road from Shillong to this tiny village passes through pretty scenery that becomes dramatic at the Dympep viewpoint, where a photogenic V-shape valley slits deeply into the plateau.
The grassy moors surrounding Cherrapunjee justify Meghalaya’s over-played ‘Scotland of the East’ tourist-office soubriquet, although they’re dotted withmonoliths and scarred by quarrying. The Nohkalikai Falls are particularly dramatic, especially in the monsoon when their capacity increases 20-fold. You
can see them from the viewpoint (admission ₹10, camera/video ₹20/50; h8am-5pm)
located on a plateau at the end of a mountain ridge 4.4km from Sohra market. Local taxis (₹50) shuttle passengers to the viewpoint. Much more impressive, however, is the series of ‘grand canyon’ valleys around the region, which plunge into deep lush chasms of tropical forest.
The most fascinating sight around Cherrapunjee are the incredible root bridges – living rubber fig-tree roots which ingenious Khasi villagers have, over decades, trained across streams to form natural pathways. Three of these root bridges (including an amazing ‘double-decker’) are near Nongriat. Access is via the pretty village of Tyrna, 2km from Mawshamok. The round trip into the canyon where these root bridges stand is an eight-hour slog from Tyrna, involving a 2000-step ascent and descent through very steep terrain.
Although straggling for several kilometres, Cherrapunjee (known locally as Sohra) has a compact centre. Huddling beside the marketplace is the Sumo stand, with connections to Shillong (₹250, three hours).

OdishaWhy Go?
Odisha (Orissa) slipped off the tourist radar once Puri’s hippy-hangout days began to fade, but it’s beginning to reestablish itself as an off-the-beaten-track favourite for more adventurous types. Those who make the effort are rewarded with an intricate patchwork of history, culture and natural beauty, along with an old-fashioned sprinkling of sun and sand.
The forested hills of the southwest (and overly officious bureaucracy) keep Adivasi (tribal) groups hidden from mainstream tourism, but it is still possible to visit their fascinating weekly markets. Forests elsewhere – both inland and along the coast – are home to some of Odisha’s wonderful nature reserves, where you can spy on 6m-long crocs, rare dolphins, endangered sea turtles and thousands of nesting birds.
Foodies will relish a whole new set of regional flavours cooked up in Odishan kitchens, while history buffs will be left salivating over long-lost Buddhist universities, ancient Jain rock carvings and centuries-old Hindu relics, including Konark’s unparalleled Sun Temple.

History Formerly known as Kalinga, Utkala and more recently Orissa, Odisha (per a long-standing name-change campaign that finally received government approval in 2010) was once a formidable maritime empire that had trading routes leading down into Indonesia, but its history is somewhat hazy until the demise of the Kalinga dynasty in 260 BC at the hands of the great emperor Ashoka. Appalled at the carnage he had caused, Ashoka forswore violence and converted to Buddhism.
Around the 1st century BC Buddhism declined and Jainism was restored as the faith of the people. During this period the monastery caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri (in Bhubaneswar) were excavated as important Jain centres.
By the 7th century AD Hinduism had supplanted Jainism. Under the Kesari and Ganga kings, trade and commerce increased and Odishan culture flourished – countless temples from that classical period still stand. The Odishans defied the Muslim rulers in Delhi until finally falling to the Mughals during the 16th century, when many of Bhubaneswar’s temples were destroyed.
Until Independence, Odisha was ruled by Afghans, Marathas and the British. Since the 1990s a Hindu fundamentalist group, Bajrang Dal, has undertaken a
violent campaign against Christians in Odisha in response to missionary activity. The often illiterate and dispossessed tribal people have suffered the most from the resulting communal violence, which has been as much about power, politics and land as religious belief.
Violence flared up again in 2008 after the killing of a Hindu leader in Kandhamal district, and thousands of Christians were moved to governmentrelief camps outside the district after their homes were torched.
The creation of the neighbouring states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh has prompted calls for the formation of a separate, tribal-oriented state, Koshal, in the northwest of Odisha, with Sambalpur as the capital. A separatist political party, the Kosal Kranti Dal (KKD), fielded candidates in the 2009 state election and took to disruptive transport protests in 2010.
The last few years have seen something of an industrial boom in Odisha, with an influx of big steel plants and controversial mining projects.
ODISHA’S INDIGENOUS TRIBES
Sixty-two Adivasi (tribal) groups live in an area that encompasses Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. In Odisha they account for one-quarter of the state’s population and mostly inhabit the jungles and hilly regions of the centre and southwest. Their distinctive cultures are expressed in music, dance and arts.
Of the more populous tribes, the Kondh number about one million and are based around Koraput in the southwest, Rayagada and the Kandhamel district in the central west. The 500,000-plus Santal live around Baripada and Khiching in the far north. The 300,000 Saura live near Gunupur near the border with Andhra Pradesh. The Bonda, known as the ‘Naked People’ for wearing minimal clothing but incredibly colourful and intricate accessories, have a population of about 5000 and live in the hills near Koraput.
As of 2012, permission from the District Collector was required to visit specific areas designated as home to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and bans on overnight lodging, private home visits, photographs and video had all been put in place. It is possible to visit tribal regions independently, but most travellers choose a customised tour, organised through private tour agencies in Bhubaneswar or Puri.
1 Climate Monsoonal rains and cyclones from July to October can seriously affect transport. Particularly devastating monsoonal disasters struck Odisha in 1999 and 2008, causing significant damage, loss of life and massive flooding.

o Lingaraj Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
The 54m-high Lingaraj Mandir, dedicated to Tribhuvaneswar (Lord of Three Worlds), dates from 1090 to 1104 (though parts are over 1400 years old) and is surrounded by dozens of smaller temples and shrines. The granite block, representing Tribhuvaneswar, is bathed daily with water, milk and bhang (marijuana). The main gate, guarded by two moustachioed yellow lions, is a spectacle in itself as lines of pilgrims approach, prasad (temple-blessed food offering) in hand.
Because the temple is surrounded by a wall, and closed to non-Hindus, foreigners can see it only from a viewing platform (this can also include foreign Hindus). Face the main entrance, walk right, then follow the wall around to the left and find the viewing platform on your left, just before you reach Chitrakarini Temple. There have been reports of aggressive hassling for ‘donations’ at the viewing platform. The money will not go to the temple; stand your ground and do not pay.
Bus 333 goes here from Master Canteen bus stand.
Mukteswar Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
The small but beautiful 10th-century Mukteswar Mandir is one of the mostornate temples in Bhubaneswar; you’ll see representations of it on posters and brochures across Odisha. Intricate carvings show a mixture of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu styles – look for the Nagarani (Snake Queen), easily mistaken by Westerners for a mermaid, who you’ll also see at the Raja Rani Mandir. The ceiling carvings and stone arch are particularly striking, as is the arched torana (architrave) at the front, clearly showing Buddhist influence.
Siddheswar Mandir (

 ), in the same compound, is a
later but plainer temple with a fine red-painted Ganesh. Over the pathway is the
whitewashed Kedargauri Mandir (

 ), one of the oldest
temples in Bhubaneswar, although it has been substantially rebuilt. Bus 225 goes past here en route to Dhauli.
Vaital Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
This 8th-century temple, with a double-storey ‘wagon roof’ influenced by Buddhist cave architecture, was a centre of tantric worship, eroticism and bloody sacrifice. Look closely and you’ll see some very early erotic carvings on the walls. Chamunda (a fearsome incarnation of Devi), representing old age and death, can be seen in the dingy interior, although her necklace of skulls and her bed of corpses are usually hidden beneath her temple robes.
Parsurameswar Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
Just west of Lewis Rd lies a cluster of about 20 smaller but important temples. Best preserved is Parsurameswar Mandir, an ornate Shiva temple built around AD 650. It has lively bas-reliefs of elephant and horse processions, and Shiva images.
Raja Rani Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE

 ; Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, camera ₹25; hdawn-dusk)
Built around 1100, this temple surrounded by manicured gardens is famous for its ornate deul (temple sanctuary) and tower. Around the compass points are pairs of statues representing eight dikpalas (temple guardians). Between them,nymphs, embracing couples, elephants and lions peer from niches and decorate the pillars.
Brahmeswar Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE

Standing in well-kept gardens, flanked on its plinth by four smaller structures, this 9th-century temple is a smaller version of Lingaraj Mandir. It’s notable for its finely detailed sculptures with erotic elements. Turn right at the 13th-century Bhaskareswa Temple.
o Udayagiri & Khandagiri Caves
HISTORIC SITE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 ; admission both sites Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk)
Six kilometres west of the city centre are two hills riddled with rock-cut shelters. Many are ornately carved and thought to have been chiselled out for Jain ascetics in the 1st century BC.
Ascending the ramp at Udayagiri (Sunrise Hill), note Swargapuri (Cave 9) to the right with its devotional figures. Hathi Gumpha (Cave 14) at the top has a 117-line inscription relating the exploits of its builder, King Kharavela of Kalinga, who ruled from 168 BC to 153 BC.
Around to the left you’ll see Bagh Gumpha (Tiger Cave; Cave 12), with its entrance carved as a tiger mouth. Nearby are Pavana Gumpha (Cave of Purification) and small Sarpa Gumpha (Serpent Cave), where the tiny door is surmounted by a three-headed cobra. On the summit are the remains of a defensive position. Around to the southeast is the single-storey elephant-guarded Ganesh Gumpha (Cave 10), almost directly above the two-storey Rani ka Naur (Queen’s Palace Cave; Cave 1), carved with Jain symbols and battle scenes.
Continue back to the entrance via Chota Hathi Gumpha (Cave 3), with its carvings of elephants, and the double-storey Jaya Vijaya Cave (Cave 5), with a bodhi tree carved in the central area.
Across the road, Khandagiri offers fine views over Bhubaneswar from its summit. The steep path splits about one-third of the way up the hill. The right path goes to Ananta Cave (Cave 3), with its carved figures of athletes, women,elephants and geese carrying flowers. Further along is a series of Jain temples; at the top is another (18th-century) Jain temple.
Buses don’t go to the caves, but some go close (Bus 801 to Baramunda bus stand, for example). A shared/private autorickshaw shouldn’t cost much more than ₹20/200.

HERITAGE HOTEL
Located a mere 3km from the Dhenkanal train station (an easy train ride from Bhubaneswar), the wonderful Gajlaxmi Palace, tucked away amid stunning scenery in the untapped forests of the Dhenkanal district, dates back to 1935. The palace belonged to Rajkumar Shri Shesh Pratap Singh Deo, a member of the Dhenkanal royal family. Today, his grandson, JP Singh Deo, and Navneeta, his lovely wife, have opened up two rooms inside their tranquil slice of royal history to guests.
Sleeping here is like overnighting in a museum – the whole place is chock full of Singh Deo’s antiques collected around the world and the whole place lives and breathes of decadent days gone by. The surrounding forest hides at least 22 wild elephants, a common sight on JP’s morning and evening nature walks Wild boar jungle fowl andcommon sight on JP’s morning and evening nature walks. Wild boar, jungle fowl and barking deer also roam freely outside the palace doors. JP grew up here and is ever too pleased to take you to rarely visited Sabara tribal villages or nearby Joranda Temples, or tell tales of elephant and tiger kills in crazier days over wonderful meals sourced from their own organic gardens. Paradise found.

ODIA CUISINE
Mustard is the staple in Odishan kitchens, used ubiquitously in seed, paste and oil forms, giving many Odia dishes a distinct pungent flavour. A typical meal consists of bhata (rice) served alongside a variety of tasty side dishes such as kaharu phula bhaja (fried pumpkin flower); dalma (dhal cooked with pumpkin, potato, plantains and eggplant, then fried in a five-spice oil of fenugreek, cumin, black cumin, anise and mustard, topped with grated coconut); and besara (vegetables or river fish with mustard-paste gravy). Saga bhaja – leafy greens lightly fried with garlic paste and a five-seed mixture called pancha phutan (cumin, mustard, anis, black cumin and chilli) – is also a treat here. On the coast, fish and prawns are omnipresent: sarison macha is a superb favourite fish dish cooked in a mustard-based curry.

BUS
Bhubaneswar has a relatively foreigner-friendly numbered city-bus system that runs between 7am and 9pm from the bus stand known as Master Canteen, right by the train station. Double check your bus is going where you want it to, as some bus numbers run along more than one route.
Note that for Puri, it’s cheaper to catch a private bus (₹40) from outside the State Museum.

TAXI/AUTORICKSHAW
An autorickshaw/taxi to the airport costs ₹50/250. There’s a prepaid taxi stand at the airport. Autorickshaws are allowed to drop-off passengers at the airport, but they’re not really supposed to pick-up from there, so you may have to walk to the main road to hail one.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
SATKOSIA GORGE SANCTUARY
This 525-sq-km forested sanctuary (%8763102681; www.satkosia.org; per day Indian/foreigner ₹20/1000; h6am-6pm) is straddled by a breathtaking gorge, cut by the mighty Mahanadi River, and is one of the most beautiful natural spots in Odisha. The sanctuary as a whole is home to significant populations of gharial and mugger crocodiles, plus 38 species of mammal, including elephants, leopards, sambar deer, wild dogs, jackals, giant squirrels and around a dozen tigers. However, this is not a place to come for a wildlife safari; tourists are not allowed inside the park’s core zone, where most of the wildlife is found, and 4WD safaris are not on offer. The main appeal of coming here is the opportunity to spend some time deep inside the protected forests of a stunning national park. The setting is gloriously peaceful and you can spot crocs in the crocodile sanctuary or on the riverbank if you take a boat trip from Tikarpada.
The main entry gate of the reserve is at Pampasar, 30km southwest of Angul. Satkosia Wildlife Division (%8763102681; www.satkosia.org; Hakimpada, Angul) manages four or five sets of accommodation that are run by local communities. The nicest is the new Nature Camp Chhotkei (www.satkosia.org; s/d incl meals, guide & nature hike ₹3000/3500), where you’ll find five spacious eco-cottages. Meals are simple but tasty and served proudly and substantially by villagers. Simpler cottages and tents are available at Nature Camp Purunakote (www.satkosia.org; tent/cottage per person ₹1000/1200). Meals here cost an extra ₹500 per person per day, although there are cheaper restaurants in the village. Nature Camp Tikarpada (www.satkosia.org; tent incl meals & nature hike ₹1800-2200; hDec-Mar) has the most spectacular setting, perched above the golden-sand beaches of the Mahanadi River with the gorge as a scenic backdrop. Tented accommodation here is basic – even the ‘deluxe’ tents have outhouse bathrooms, albeit private ones, and the standard tents have no showers. As at Chhotkei, rates include meals and a morning nature hike, which here includes a visit to the nearby crocodile sanctuary. Boat rides (₹1000) along the river are also available.You’ll need to stop by Satkosia Wildlife Division in Angul for permissions and reservations – a mere formality, but bring a copy of your passport and visa. The office is a 1km walk from the bus stand; turn left at the restaurant called Hotel Sagar, then left at the green cavalryman statue, keep walking to the end of the road, turn left and the office is on your right. From the train station it costs ₹100 in an autorickshaw. If you get stuck in Angul, Hotel Santi (%06764-230386; www.santihotels.com; Bus Stand, Angul; s/d ₹750/1000, with AC ₹1500/1800; aW), overlooking the bus stand, has comfortable rooms, a good restaurant and free wi-fi. It can also arrange a car and driver for you to visit Satkosia; expect to pay around ₹2000, leaving one day and returning the next.
Four buses go from Angul bus stand to Tikarpada (₹35, 2½ hours, 6am, 9.30am,
3.30pm and 5pm), via the park gate at Pampasar, where you’re supposed to pay your park fees (travellers sometimes get away without paying this if travelling by bus), the turn-off for Chhotkei (5km from the main road) and Purunakote. Return buses leave Tikarpada at 6.30am, 10.30am and 1pm.
From Angul bus stand there are frequent buses to Bhubaneswar (₹100/140, four hours) and Cuttack (non-AC/AC ₹80/110, three hours) between 6am and 6pm.
The quickest way to get to Angul from Bhubaneswar is on either the 12893 Bhubaneswar–Balangir Express (2nd class/AC chair ₹70/222, 2¼ hours, 6.45am) or the 18106 Bhubaneswar–Rourkella Express (2nd class/AC chair ₹70/222, 2¼ hours,
1.40pm). There are at least four other slightly slower daily trains. Returning, the Bhubaneswar–Balangir Express (now numbered 12894) leaves Angul for Bhubaneswar at 7.35pm.
AROUND BHUBANESWAR
Chausath Yogini
Rediscovered in the 1950s among rice fields 15km south of the city, this small but serene 9th-century open-roofed temple is dedicated to yoginis (female goddess attendants) and is one of only four of its kind in India. The temple – no larger than a village hut – contains 64 (chausath) carved yoginis, each shown standing on top of her vaharna (vehicle; often in animal form). Few tourists make it out here, which adds to the tranquility of the location, beside a large pond and surrounded by farmland.
While you’re here, don’t miss visiting the fascinating Soumya Handicraft (Chausath Yogini, Hirapur; h8am-5pm), the small workshop-gallery of a local artist who paints, carves and sells his work from his home, close to the temple. On displayare fabulously detailed patachitra (₹500 to ₹2000), quirky brightly painted whiskey and beer bottles (₹200 to ₹800) and some stunning palm-leaf scroll carvings (₹200 to ₹8000). Some pieces are distinctly tribal Odishan in design, others have Buddhist influences or a Hindu tantric flavour. His palm-leaf representations of the yoginis make wonderfully unique souvenirs.
No buses come out this way, so you’ll have to take an autorickshaw. Expect to pay around ₹100 to ₹150 one-way from Tankapani Rd, and more like ₹200 from Cuttack Rd. Note that not everyone has heard of this place, so you may have to ask more than one driver before you get a response. The temple is pronounced ‘chorsat jorgini’ in Odia.
Dhauli
In about 260 BC, 11 of of Ashoka’s 14 famous edicts were carved onto a large rock at Dhauli, 8km south of Bhubaneswar. The rock, now a small tourist attraction called the Ashokan Rock Edicts, is protected by a grill-fronted facade. A large sign offers English translations of each edict. Above the edicts, on top of a mound, is a carved elephant, representing Buddha, seemingly emerging from a small rock.
Just beyond the rock edicts is the huge white Shanti Stupa (Peace Pagoda), built by Japanese monks in 1972 on a hill to the right. Older Buddhist reliefs are set into the modern structure, and there are great views of the surrounding countryside from the top.
Bus 225 goes to Dhauli (₹10, 30 minutes) from Bhubaneswar’s Master Canteen bus stand. From the turn-off, it’s a pleasant, largely tree-shaded 3km walk to the rock edicts (on your left), and then a short, steep walk to the stupa (slightly further along on your right). Alternatively take a shared/private autorickshaw (₹5/50 one-way) from the turn-off. You can continue on to Puri from the turn-off, flagging down any bus that passes.
Pipli
This colourful town, 16km southeast of Bhubaneswar, is notable for its brilliantappliqué craft, which incorporates small mirrors and is used for door and wall hangings and the more traditional canopies hung over Jagannath and family during festival time. Lampshades and parasols hanging outside the shops turn the main road into an avenue of rainbow colours. The work is still done by local families in workshops behind the shops; you may be able to go back and have a look. During Diwali, it’s particularly vibrant. Pipli is easily accessible by any bus between Bhubaneswar and Puri or Konark.
SOUTHEASTERN ODISHA
Southeastern Odisha hugs the coast of the Bay of Bengal and is home to the state’s most visited spots, including the backpacker outpost of Puri and the Unesco-protected Sun Temple at Konark.
Puri
%06752 / Pop 158,000
Hindu pilgrims, Indian holidaymakers and foreign travellers all make their way to Puri, setting up camp in different parts of town. For Hindus, Puri is one of the holiest pilgrimage places in India, with religious life revolving around the great Jagannath Mandir and its famous Rath Yatra (Car Festival). The town’s other attraction is its long, sandy beach – better for strolling than swimming.
In the 1970s, travellers on the hippie trail through Southeast Asia were attracted here by the sea and bhang (marijuana), which is legal in Shiva’s Puri. There’s little trace of that scene today (though the bhang hasn’t departed); travellers come just to hang out and recharge their backpacking spirit.
The action is along a few kilometres of coast. The backpacker part of town is bunched up towards the eastern end of Chakra Tirtha (CT) Rd, while Bengali holidaymakers flock to busy New Marine Rd, where there is lots of hangout action on the long esplanade.
8 Dangers & Annoyances Muggings and attacks on women have been reported along isolated stretches of beach, even during theday, so take care. Ocean currents can become treacherous in Puri, and drownings are not uncommon, so don’t venture out beyond your depth. Ask one of the nolias (fishermen/lifeguards), with their white-painted, cone-shaped wicker hats, for the best spots and keep a look out for Sea Riders, a group of traditional fishermen turned lifeguards through an initiative of a local NGO.

Jagannath Mandir
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
This mighty temple belongs to Jagannath (Lord of the Universe), an incarnation of Vishnu. The jet-black deity with large, round, white eyes is hugely popular across Odisha; figures of Jagannath are tended and regularly dressed in newclothes at shrines across the state. Built in its present form in 1198, the temple (closed to non-Hindus) is surrounded by two walls, but you can spot its 58m- high sikhara (spire) topped by the flag and wheel of Vishnu.
Guarded by two stone lions and a pillar crowned by the Garuda that once stood at the Sun Temple at Konark, the eastern entrance (Lion Gate) is the passageway for the chariot procession of Rath Yatra.
Jagannath, brother Balbhadra and sister Subhadra reside supreme in the central jagamohan (assembly hall). Priests continually garland and dress the three throughout the day for different ceremonies. The temple employs about 6000 men to perform the complicated rituals involved in caring for the gods. An estimated 20,000 people – divided into 36 orders and 97 classes – are dependent on Jagannath for their livelihood.
Non-Hindus can spy from the roof of Raghunandan Library (

‘donation’, while not officially compulsory, is expected (₹10 is fine, though they will ask for more). The library is closed on Sunday, so touts who will help you to a nearby rooftop prey on tourists and demand ₹100 – easily negotiated down to ₹50. Enter around the back of the building to the right-hand side and follow the arrows and signs through a fascinating ruined monastery.

Puri is no palm-fringed paradise – the beach is wide, shelves quickly with a nasty shore break and is shadeless – but the newly crowned Model Beach, part of a sustainable, community-run beach tourism initiative, offers a 700m stretch of sand that’s easily Puri’s finest and cleanest. Palm umbrellas provide shade and cabana boys/lifeguards, known as Sea Riders, hawk fixed-price beach chairs (₹20) and massages (₹50 to ₹200) and are responsible for keeping the beach clean.

Bubu is a tribal and cultural tourism veteran whose tour company focuses on rural and special-interest ethnic tourism. In addition to multiday tribal tours and car hire, Heritage also offers cycle-rickshaw tours (two hours ₹300) around the backstreets of old Puri, and Odishan-cuisine cookery classes (half-day ₹500) at the excellent Wildgrass Restaurant, also owned by Bubu.
Heritage is also interesting for its ‘Green Riders’ program, in which 75 cycle- rickshaw riders are trained in fixed pricing, self-respect and why spiking prices for foreign tourists is uncool. That said, we still found we still had to negotiate fares with them!
Bubu’s latest venture is the beautiful tribal-region countryside retreat, Desia.

LOCAL KNOWLEDGECOASTAL RETREATS
For an idyllic getaway that’s still within shouting distance of both Puri and Konark, consider one of these coastal retreats.
o Nature Camp, Konark Retreat
(%9437029989; www.naturecampindia.com; s/d incl breakfast ₹2000/3000)
RESORT
Plopped down on the banks of the Ramchandi River, just across from a sandy Bay of Bengal beach, and only 10km south of Konark, this friendly, laid-back tented camp has a shanty feel to it with tented rooms dotted around a slightly unkempt forest clearing. The tents are fan-cooled only, and are comfortable rather than luxurious, but come with cute attached shower rooms with sit-down flush toilets.
The food comes in the form of two sumptuous Odia thalis (veg ₹250, nonveg ₹350), both cooked in a traditional charcoal-fired chulha (stove) and served on a banana leaf.
The camp is about 500m off the main Puri–Konark road; there’s a big sign on the main road so you can take any bus (Puri ₹20, Konark ₹5) and jump off when you see it.

Each cottage has TV, AC and a modern bathroom, but there’s no internet. To get here take any bus between Puri (₹20) and Konark (₹5) and look for the big sign on the main road.

The narrow lanes of Puri’s holy quarter are full of makeshift sweet shops, perhaps none more famous than Puri Cheesecake. Bikram Sahoo and his six brothers have been churning out this unique Odishan delight, known as chhena poda (burnt cheese), for 45 years. It’s cottage cheese, sugar and cardamom cooked in an iron pan over an open flame – a real treat. Though it’s more like a flan than traditional cheesecake, it’s off the mark by name only.
To find it, walk down Temple Rd from Jagganath Mandir, pass a small public square about 300m on the right, and it’s another 100m on your right next door to Jagganath Pump House.

The easiest way to Bhubaneswar is Bus 171 (₹100, two hours), which leaves
from Medical Sq ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) on Grand Rd every 30 to 45 minutes
between 7.45am and 5.30pm and will drop you at the Master Canteen bus stand, next to Bhubaneswar’s train station. But private buses, leaving from the same place, are cheaper (₹40, two hours).
Frequent buses to Konark (₹25, 45 minutes) leave from the Konark bus
stand ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ). The last bus back is at 6.30pm.
Next to the Konark bus stand is the sprawling main bus stand (
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %224461), where frequent buses head to Bhubaneswar (₹40, two
hours), Cuttack (₹50, 2½ hours) and Satapada (₹33, two to three hours), as well as AC (seat/sleeper ₹550/580, 13 hours, 6pm to 8pm) and non-AC (seat ₹350, 13 hours, from 3pm) buses to Kolkata.
For Pipli and Raghurajpur, take a Bhubaneswar bus.
TRAIN
At least a dozen daily trains go to Bhubaneswar (2nd-class unreserved seat ₹10 to ₹50, two hours, from 6am to 11.50pm). The daily 58417 Puri-GNPR Express goes to Brahmapur (2nd-class seat ₹40, 4½ hours) at 8am. The 12801 Purushottam Express heads to Delhi (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹715/1860/2720, 31 hours) at 9.45pm, while the 18410 Sri Jagannath Express leaves for Kolkata (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹300/805/1150, 10 hours) at 10.30pm.
8 Getting Around A few places along CT Rd rent bicycles (per day ₹50), mopeds (per day ₹250) and motorbikes (per day ₹350).
From CT Rd, cycle-rickshaws charge about ₹30 to the train station and ₹40 to ₹50 to the bus stands or Jagannath Mandir.
Raghurajpur
The fascinating artists’ village of Raghurajpur, 14km north of Puri, is two streets and 120 thatched brick houses adorned with murals of geometric patterns and mythological scenes – a traditional art form that has almost died out in Odisha.The village is most famous for its patachitra (Odishan cloth paintings). With eye-aching attention and a very fine brush, artists mark out animals, flowers, deities and demons, which are then illuminated with bright colours. It makes for very beautiful and unique souvenirs.
Take the Bhubaneswar bus from Puri and look for the ‘Raghurajpur The Craft Village’ signpost 11km north of Puri, then walk the last 1km. Don’t get cornered by the few shops that have set up first but which are technically outside the village itself.
Konark
%06758 / Pop 15,000
The iconic Sun Temple at Konark – a Unesco World Heritage Site – is one of India’s signature buildings and Odisha’s raison d’être. Most visitors are day- trippers from Bhubaneswar or Puri, which makes sense, as Konark isn’t a particularly nice place to stay. However, you might want to consider staying a bit closer, at one of the excellent coastal retreats located just a few kilometres away, between here and Puri.
Originally nearer the coast (the sea has receded 3km), Konark was visible from far out at sea and known as the ‘Black Pagoda’ by sailors, in contrast to Puri’s whitewashed Jagannath. The inland lighthouse near Chandrabhaga Beach is an odd testament to that fact.

DON'T MISS SUN TEMPLESun Temple
(Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video ₹25, guide per hr ₹150; hdawn-8pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
The massive Sun Temple was constructed in the mid-13th century, probably by Odishan king Narashimhadev I to celebrate his military victory over the Muslims, and was in use for maybe only three centuries. In the late 16th century the 40m-high sikhara (spire) partially collapsed: speculation about causes ranges from marauding Mughals removing the copper over the cupola to a ransacking Kalapahad displacing the Dadhinauti (arch stone), to simple wear and tear from recurring cyclones – the truth was apparently lost with Konark’s receding shoreline.
The entire temple was conceived as the cosmic chariot of the sun god Surya. Seven mighty prancing horses (representing the days of the week) rear at the strain of moving this stone leviathan on 24 stone cartwheels (representing the hours of the day) that stand around the base. The temple was positioned so that dawn light would illuminate the deul (temple sanctuary) interior and the presiding deity, which may have been moved to Jagannath Mandir in Puri in the 17th century – the interior of the temple was filled in with stone in 1903 'in order to preserve this superb specimen of old Indian architecture’.
The gajasimha (main entrance) is guarded by two stone lions crushing elephants and leads to the intricately carved nritya mandapa (dancing hall). Steps, flanked by straining horses, rise to the still-standing jagamohan (assembly hall). Behind is the spireless deul, with its three impressive chlorite images of Surya aligned to catch the sun at dawn, noon and sunset.
The base and walls present a chronicle in stone of Kalinga life; you’ll see women cooking and men hunting. Many are in the erotic style for which Konark is famous and include entwined couples as well as solitary exhibitionists.
Guides can be useful here as the temple’s history is a complicated amalgam of fact and legend, and religious and secular imagery, and the guides’ explanations can be thought provoking. But make sure you get a government-approved one; the tourist office at Yatrinivas hotel, beside the Archaeological Museum, can help.

INDIAN
A busy, friendly, AC restaurant with a big range of Indian veg and nonveg dishes, as well as traveller favourites such as chips and banana pancakes. Also has a few simple rooms (₹400 to ₹500, with AC ₹800) out back if you get stuck here. It’s right by the bus drop-off, two minutes walk from Sun Temple.
8 Information There’s an ATM and a couple of internet cafes in the dusty lane leading to Sun Temple. Restaurants and cheap hotels cluster the main road by the bus drop-off. The bus stand is set back from the main road, 200m further away from the temple.
8 Getting There & Away Bus 441 is the most comfortable to Puri (₹40, one hour), but cheaper, more frequent private buses (₹25) also ply the route. There are also frequent departures to Bhubaneswar (₹45, two hours).
Chilika Lake
Chilika Lake is Asia’s largest brackish lagoon. Swelling from 600 sq km in April and May to 1100 sq km in the monsoon, the shallow lake is separated from the Bay of Bengal by a 60km-long sand bar called Rajhansa.
The lake is noted for the million-plus migratory birds – including grey-legged geese, herons, cranes and pink flamingos – that flock here in winter (from November to mid-January) from as far away as Siberia and Iran and concentrate in a 3-sq-km area within the bird sanctuary on Nalabana Island.
Other attractions are rare Irrawaddy dolphins near Satapada, the pristine beach along Rajhansa, and Kalijai Island temple where Hindu pilgrims flock for the Makar Mela festival in January.
Satapada
%06752Little more than a bus stand, a hotel, and a cluster of road-shack restaurants beside a jetty, the tiny village of Satapada, on a headland jutting southwestwards into Chilika Lake, is the starting point for dolphin-spotting boat trips; the boats usually cruise towards the new sea mouth for a paddle in the sea and some dolphin-and bird-spotting en route. Travellers have reported dolphins being (illegally) herded and otherwise harassed; make it clear you don’t want this.
OTDC (%262077; Yatrinivas Hotel; per person ₹180-250, depending on the number of people)
runs a three-hour tour of the lake which leaves from between 9.30am and 10am each morning.
Dolphin Motor Boat Association (%7377653372; Satapada Jetty; 1½hr/3hr/4hr/8hr
trips per boat ₹1900/2100/2400/3700), a cooperative of local boat owners, has set-price trips that include dolphin sightseeing, Nalabana Bird Sanctuary and Kalijai Island temple. Note, there are two rival associations running under the same name; they run similar tours, but we feel the one to the left of the jetty is more trustworthy, albeit slightly more expensive. Don’t forget to take water on your boat trip.
The grandly named Chilika Ecopark (Satapada Jetty) is a small but pleasant palm-tree-shaded park by the jetty which has on display the 12m-long skeleton of a baleen whale that was washed up on the shore near here in 2007.
Considering the potential storybook lakeside setting, Yatrinivas (%262077; d ₹550, with AC ₹1500; a) is surprisingly uninspired. Its three ageing non-AC rooms have seen better days, but are very spacious and, like the more modern AC rooms, have balconies with lake views. The restaurant (mains ₹50 to ₹150) is decent value.
The daily ferry crossings to Barkul stopped some time ago. However, there is one daily ferry to Balugaon (₹50, five hours), a few kilometres north of Barkul. It leaves Satapda at around 1.30pm. The return leaves Balugaon at 6.30am. An autorickshaw from Balugaon to Barkul is around ₹100.
If you want to charter your own boat from Satapada, expect to pay at least ₹3000 for a trip across the lake to Barkul.
More frequent ferries (pedestrians/bicycles/motorbikes/cars ₹4/5/15/300, 30 minutes) ply between Satapada and the Janhikuda jetty just to the west, where vehicles can then head west, and around to the north side of the lake. It’s awonderfully scenic route. Daily departures are at 7.30am, 10am, 1pm and 4pm, returning at 8am, 10.30am, 1.30pm and 4.30pm.
A bus to Berhampur (₹75, 3½ hours), near Gopalpur-on-Sea, travels on the
7.30am ferry before following the beautiful countryside road for two hours until it meets up with the main highway. Wait for the bus on the ferry, then jump on as it drives off. It will already be full of villagers by the time it reaches Satapada so don’t expect a seat, but passengers get off along the way so you won’t have to stand for long. The bus will drop you at the turn-off for Gopalpur-on-Sea, if you ask, from where you can wave down any passing bus (₹11, 20 minutes). The return bus leaves Berhampur at 12.40pm and crosses Chilika Lake on the
4.30pm ferry to Satapada.
Pretty much every hotel and travel agent in Puri does day trips to Chilika Lake, but it’s easy to come here independently by bus (₹33, two to three hours). The last bus back to Puri leaves Satapada at around 6pm.
Barkul
%06756
On the northern shore of Chilika, Barkul is just a scattering of houses, small guesthouses and food stalls on a lane which runs from the main highway down to the government-run hotel property Panthanivas Barkul. From here boats make trips to Nalabana Island (full of nesting birds in December and January) and Kalijai Island (which has a temple on it), though you could charter you own boat to anywhere; deal directly with the boat hands.
Panthanivas Barkul hotel runs two-hour round trips to Kalijia for ₹955 per boat (up to seven passengers), including some time on the island. The four-hour trip to Kalijia and Nalabana costs ₹2865 per boat, but tends only to be done in December and January when the birds are on Nalabana. You can also get out on the lake on a pedal boat (₹40 to ₹60).
Panthanivas Barkul (%227488; pns.barkul@gmail.com; d ₹900, with AC ₹2250, AC cottage
₹2600, all incl breakfast; ai) has a great setting, and is one of the best government- run hotels in Odisha, with comfortable rooms overlooking the lake. The AC rooms and cottages are newer and cleaner but all rooms are good here. Therestaurant does decent Indian and Chinese food (mains ₹50 to ₹170), including some seafood. And there’s a bar (open from 11am to 10pm), which is dimly lit and has plastic chairs, but sells large bottles of Kingfisher Light (₹130) and is run by a friendly old guy.
There’s a handful of cheaper guesthouses on the lane leading to Panthanivas Barkul.
Frequent buses dash along National Hwy 5 between Bhubaneswar (₹80, 1½ hours) and Berhampur (₹60, 1½ hours). You can get off anywhere en route.
Panthanivas Barkul is at least 2km walk from the main highway. If you don’t have much luggage it’s a lovely, signposted walk past village homes. Alternatively, hop in a passing autorickshaw (shared/private ₹10/50).
A ferry for Satapada (₹50, five hours) leaves from nearby Balugaon at
6.30am. It’s about ₹100 to get to Balugaon in an autorickshaw.
Rambha
%06810
The village of Rambha, on the northwestern shore of Chilika Lake, is the nearest place to stay for turtle-watching on Rushikulya beach.
Panthanivas Rambha (%278346; rabi.dash09@gmail.com; dm ₹200, d ₹800, with AC ₹1560, AC cottage ₹3150, all incl breakfast; a) is a fine government-run property with
good-value non-AC rooms with balconies and lake views. The AC rooms are more modern, but not worth the extra money. The huge eight-bed dorm is extremely spartan, but does have its own bathroom. The restaurant (mains ₹50 to ₹170) is decent, and there’s also a bar here. Speedboat (per hour ₹2000) or motorboat (per hour ₹700) tours of the lake are available. If you want to charter your own boat across the lake, it costs around ₹2000 for Satapada.
The hotel is a 1km walk from the main highway (ignore the sign that says 5km), or hop in a passing autorickshaw (₹10).
From the highway you can easily wave down buses to Barkul (₹30, 30 minutes), Berhampur (₹30, one hour) and Bhubaneswar (₹110, two hours).
ODISHA’S OLIVE RIDLEY MARINE TURTLESOne of the smallest sea turtles and a threatened species, the olive ridley marine turtle swims up from deeper waters beyond Sri Lanka to mate and lay eggs on Odisha’s beaches. The main nesting sites are Gahirmatha (in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary), Devi River mouth near Konark, and Rushikulya River mouth by Chilika Lake.
Turtle deaths due to fishing practices are unfortunately common. Although there are regulations, such as requiring the use of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) on trawl nets and banning fishing from certain prohibited congregation and breeding areas, these laws are routinely flouted in Odisha.
Casuarina trees have been planted to help preserve Devi beach but they occupy areas of soft sand that are necessary for a turtle hatchery. Other potential threats include the upcoming Astaranga Seaport and Thermal Power Plant and the proposed Palur port, which is planned right next to the Rushikulya River mouth nesting site (which it would destroy if allowed to continue as planned).
In January and February the turtles congregate near nesting beaches and, if conditions are right, come ashore. If conditions aren’t right, they reabsorb their eggs and leave without nesting.
Hatchlings emerge 50 to 55 days later and are guided to the sea by the luminescence of the ocean and stars. They can be easily distracted by bright lights; unfortunately National Hwy 5 runs within 2km of Rushikulya beach. Members of local turtle clubs in Gokharkuda, Podampeta and Purunabandha village gather up disoriented turtles and take them to the sea. It’s best to visit the nesting beach at dawn when lights are not necessary.
The best place to see nesting and hatching is on the northern side of Rushikulya River, near the villages of Purunabandha and Gokharkuda, 20km from the nearest accommodation in Rambha. During nesting and hatching, activity takes place throughout the night: don’t use lights.
Ask staff at Panthanivas Rambha what conditions are like, or contact the Wildlife Society of Odisha (%6712311513; www.wildlifeorissa.org; Shantikunj, Link Rd, Cuttack). Rickshaws between Rambha and Rushikulya cost ₹400 return for a half day and ₹800 for the full day.
Gopalpur-on-Sea
%0680 / Pop 6660
If you dig nosing about decaying seaside resorts, Gopalpur-on-Sea, a seaside town the British left to slide into history until Bengali holidaymakers rediscovered its attractions in the 1980s, could be just your thing. Prior to this, it had a noble history as a seaport with connections to Southeast Asia, the evidence

It’s no paradise, but the peaceful and relatively clean beach is great for a stroll or a paddle, and it’s oddly charismatic in its own strange, antiquated way. And, unlike Puri, there’s proper seaside accommodation right on the beach.
The main village is a couple of hundred metres back from the beach, along the road to Berhampur. Here you’ll find the turn-off for Mayfair Palm Beach as well as a couple of internet cafes (per hour ₹20), a post office and a police station. For cash, there’s an ATM on the seafront.

SOUTHWESTERN ODISHASOUTHWESTERN ODISHA
As of 2012, prior permission from the District Collector was required for foreigners wishing to visit some specific parts of tribal regions. Some agencies were saying this rule may change, so check online travel forums before you fork out for an expensive tour; you may be able to do your trip independently. Assuming the rules don’t change, the permissions process is taken care of either by a government-approved tour agency, a government-approved guide or a local tourism office, and usually takes two to three days to arrange (just give them a copy of your passport and visa, and wait), though it can take up to five days.
Photography and overnight stays in Adivasi households are strictly prohibited by law.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
WEEKLY MARKETS
There are weekly haats (markets) held every day at different villages in Koraput district, sometimes two or three at different places on the same day. Tribespeople from surrounding villages will descend on the market of the day to trade handicrafts, clothes, jewellery and foodstuffs. They are fabulously colourful places to visit, and the best chance foreign tourists have of interracting with Odishan tribespeople.
Ondakelli Market – one of the most fascinating of all the haats – trades during the morning only. Other markets last all day. Kundli is the region’s largest food market, while Koraput itself has a Sunday haat, which, because of its location in the town centre, is open to foreigners even without special permission.
Selected haats include the following: A Monday Subai – small market, 34km from Koraput A Tuesday Ramgiri – 64km from Koraput A Wednesday Nandapur – 45km from Koraput A Thursday Onkadelli – numerous tribes represented, including Bonda; 65km from Jeypore A Friday Kundli – region's largest food market; also numerous tribes represented A Saturday Laximpur – 56km from Koraput; reachable on any Rayagada- bound bus A Sunday Koraput – in the town centre; also one of the bigger markets
Koraput
%06852 / Pop 40,000
Up in the cool, forested hills, the small market town of Koraput is by far the nicest of the main towns in which to base yourself in this region. There’s ay
g
friendly village feel to it, a weekly market for which you don’t need special permission to visit, and the main temple here is fascinating, especially for non- Hindus who can’t enter the Jagannath Mandir in Puri.
1 Sights & Activities Koraput’s helpful tourist office (%06852-250318; www.orissatourism.gov.in; Tourist Complex, near Station Circuit House; h10am-5pm Mon-Sat) can put you in touch with government-approved guides for visits to the region’s weekly markets. The guides themselves will process the ‘prior permission’ that’s required for foreigners to visit these markets. All you need to do is give them a copy of your passport and visa, and tell them where you wish to visit; it should only take one or two days to process, but can take up to five. Don’t feel disheartened if you miss the market you wanted. There are weekly markets held at various villages in Koraput district every day of the week.
At the time of research foreigners had to be accompanied by a government- approved guide to visit any of the tribal areas where the markets are held, but ask for confirmation of this at the tourist office when you arrive in Koraput. It’s possible to get to some of the markets by bus, but you will need to hire a car for the day to visit others.
Guides charge from between ₹1000 and ₹2000 per day. Expect to pay around ₹1500 per day on top of that for car hire. Guides are often reluctant to use public transport.
To get to the tourist office, continue walking past Raj Residency, round the corner and head up the hill (200m).
Jagannath Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
 
While you’re hanging around in Koraput, waiting for permission to visit themarkets, don’t miss visiting Jagannath Temple, whose whitewashed sikhara (temple spire) overlooks the town. The courtyard around the sikhara contains numerous colourfully decorated statues of the wide-eyed Jagganath, the deity of Odisha, which you’ll see painted on homes across the state. Below the sikhara, in a side hall, you’ll walk past more than two dozen linga (phallic symbols of Shiva), before reaching some attractive displays of local ossa (traditional patterns made with white and coloured powders on doorsteps; also known as rangoli).
The temple is 200m behind the bus stand; at the bus stand, facing the police station, turn left up Post Office Rd then take the first left and look for the temple steps up to your right at the small staggered crossroads.
Sunday Market
MARKET
 
There’s a market here every day, but it’s Koraput’s all-day Sunday Market that’s the big one and worth exploring. Tribespeople and local traders alike buy and sell food produce and handmade goods in the lanes around the bus stand and behind the police station, and buying stuff from them is a rare opportunity for you to interact with tribespeople on your own.
4 Sleeping & Eating The Jagganath Temple manages three great-value budget hotels just outside its grounds.
Atithi Bhavan (%250610; atithibhaban@gmail.com; d ₹250, with AC ₹500; a), just to the right of the steps that lead to the temple, is easily the best of them, with comfortable rooms and a pure veg restaurant (thalis ₹50). Atithi Nivas

place for food in Koraput. To get here, turn left up Post Office Rd, walk past the post office and keep going straight (400m).
COUNTRYSIDE RETREATS IN THE TRIBAL SOUTHWEST
Strict regulations prohibit homestays in tribal regions these days, but for something approaching full immersion of Adivasi (tribal) culture, consider staying at one of these two fabulous countryside retreats, both of which are nestled in the village-dotted hills near Koraput.
Chandoori Sai
RESORT
(%9439528602, 9443342241; www.chandoorisai.com; Goudaguda; s/d incl meals ₹3500/5000; i) On the scenic hill road and train line between Koraput and Rayagada, and just a couple of kilometres from the tiny town of Kakirigumma, Chandoori Sai is a beautiful, Australian- run rural retreat in a village called Goudaguda, and is one of Odisha’s most stylish countryside getaways.
Run by Grass Routes, a tour agency based in Puri, this unpretentious village-like resort is a sustainable earthen-walled refuge with beautiful terracotta flooring and bamboo- sheeted ceilings. The food is fabulous, but the real coup is the guest interaction with tribal women, who act as cultural ambassadors on the property and guides through the village, and in doing so offer a brief assimilation into the vibrant Adivasi way of life.
To reach Chandoori Sai, take any bus between Koraput (40km) and Rayagada (70km) and get off at Kakirigumma; staff will then pick you up from there. Alternatively, catch the 18447 Hirakhand Express from Koraput to Bhubaneswar and get off at Kakirigumma Train Station. It leaves Koraput at 5.25pm, arriving in Kakirigumma an hour later. An unreserved 2nd-class seat costs ₹30; a sleeper is ₹140. From Bhubaneswar, the 18448 Hirakhand Express leaves at 7.35pm and arrives in Kakirigumma at 8.11am the next morning. Sleeper tickets cost ₹345.

RESORT
A gorgeous rural retreat tucked away in the tribal hills of the Koraput region,this stylish village-like resort is run by the excellent, Puri-based Heritage Tours and was just getting off the ground at the time of research. Activities on offer include hiking, cooking, craftwork and local market trips.
You can come here independently or with an all-inclusive ‘tribal tour’ package, starting at ₹19,000 for a four-day trip for two people. Desia is only 20km from Koraput, on the road to Rayagada. If you’re not on a tour, it’s best to call for a pick up from Koraput, although you could take any Rayagada-bound bus from Koraput to the village of Podagada, which is close by.
8 Information There are ATMs on the walk up to the tourist office, and a few internet cafes dotted around town. At the bus stand, there’s a handy travel agency that can book train tickets for you (commission ₹30 to ₹50).
8 Getting There & Away
BUS
From the Koraput bus stand, there are half-hourly buses to Jeypore (₹15, 40 minutes) between 6am and 8.30pm. Seven buses make the scenic trip to Rayagada (₹90, four hours) between 6am and 7pm. And at least four evening buses leave for Bhubaneswar (₹520, 12 hours) between 5pm and 7pm.
To get a bus to Onkadelli Market, you’ll have to first catch a bus to the scruffy town of Jeypore. From there, the 7.30am bus to Onkadelli (₹30, two to three hours) should get you there in time to catch the last couple of hours of the market. The Onkadelli buses leave from Jeypore’s private bus stand, which is located in front of Jeypore’s government bus stand. From Jeypore’s government bus stand, there are frequent buses to Visakhapatnam (₹230, six hours, 5am to 11pm) in Andhra Pradesh.
TRAIN
The train station is 3km from the centre; it costs ₹10/50 in a shared/private autorickshaw to get here from the bus stand.
The 18448 Hirakhand Express plies daily between Bhubaneswar and Koraput. It leaves Koraput at 5.25pm, passes Rayagada at 10.05pm, and arrives inBhubaneswar at 8.25am the next morning. Sleeper tickets cost ₹360.
There are three fabulously scenic, daily trains to Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, leaving at 9.50am, 1pm and 8.50pm. It takes around three hours. Sleeper tickets cost ₹100 to ₹140; unreserved, 2nd-class seats cost ₹40.
Rayagada
%06856 / Pop 58,000
The small town of Rayagada is the base for visiting the weekly Wednesday Chatikona market at Bissamcuttack (about 40km north). Here, highly ornamented Dongria Kondh and Desia Kondh villagers from the surrounding Niayamgiri Hills bring their produce and wares to sell. Alongside piles of chillies and dried fish are bronze animal sculptures made locally using the lost wax method. The market is considered tourist-friendly, but it’s a bit of a process organising a permit; you’ll need to track down Rayagada’s tourist officer, Ramal Loechan Gamango (%9439838936), and provide a copy of your passport and visa. He will then facilitate your paperwork through the appropriate channels.
Rayagada’s daily market is between the train station and the bus stand; turn right out of the bus stand, take the second right and it’s on your left. Here you’ll see colourfully dressed tribespeople weaving bamboo baskets alongside local traders selling fruit and veg, spices, dried fish and the like.

From Rayagada bus stand, there are three early-morning local buses to Chatikona (₹30, two hours, 4.45am, 6.30am and 9.30am). Buses to Jeypore (₹100, five hours, 6.30am, 10.30am, noon, 2pm and 4pm) all go via Koraput (₹90, four hours); the route over the forested hills is fabulously scenic. There are frequent evening buses to Bhubaneswar (₹350, 12 hours) between 4pm and
7pm.
The 18447 Hirakhand Express departs Bhubaneswar daily at 7.35pm reaching Rayagada at 4.50am and Koraput at 9.50am. Sleeper tickets cost ₹300 and ₹360 respectively. The return leaves Rayagada at 10.30pm.
WORTH A TRIP
ONKADELLI
This small village, 65km from Jeypore, has a most remarkable and vibrant Thursday market that throngs with Bonda, Gadaba, Mali and Didai villagers. In the morning it’s all business on the vegetable side; in the afternoon, the alcohol market revs up, and entire families get sloshed. The best time to visit is between 10am and 1pm.
The market has been traditionally popular with tour groups; however, due to Maoist activity in the region, outcries of ‘Human safari!’ by some and an Odishan government that cannot (or will not) ensure security of tourists, visits to Onkadelli have declined in recent years and some conservative local tour operators have dropped it from their regularly scheduled tours. Check the latest with tour operators in Bhubaneswar or Puri, or on travel forums.
Onkadelli is best accessed by hire car, although the early morning bus from Jeypore is another option, and can only be visited with a professional guide, who will enrich your experience, keep the peace if things get ugly among the alcohol and the bows and arrows, and help enforce things such as the no-photography rules for tourists. It’s feasible to come to Jeypore or Koraput independently and organise a guide (₹1000 to ₹1500). If you opt to go on your own, remember that photographs are strictly prohibited by law, and you’ll need to stop by the tourist office in Koraput to handle the paperwork. Plan ahead – at least five days to be safe – and bring a copy of your passport and visa.
For those willing to put in the effort, Onkadelli is a sight for the senses and a true Odisha highlight.
NORTHEASTERN ODISHA
Northeastern Odisha is best known for its nature sanctuaries, notably Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and Similipal National Park (though foreignersBhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary and Similipal National Park (though foreigners were being denied entry to the latter at time of research) and the excellent Buddhist ruins at Ratnagiri, Udayagiri and Lalitgiri.
Pusphagiri Ruins
These fascinating Buddhist ruins are the remnants of one of India’s earliest mahaviharas (Buddhist monasteries which were, effectively, the universities of their day). Pusphagiri Mahavihara had three campuses – Ratnagiri, Udayagiri and Lalitgiri – each built upon a small hilltop in the low-lying Langudi Hills. The Kelua River provided a scenic backdrop, and these days supports small farming communities and their mud-and-thatch villages which dot the rural landscape.
If you leave early, and restrict yourself to just one of the three sites, it’s possible to visit the area in a day trip by bus from Bhubaneswar, but there are decent places to stay and doing so not only gives you the chance to explore each of the three sites properly, it also allows you the opportunity to soak up the peaceful charms of village life in the Odishan countryside.
SIMILIPAL NATIONAL PARK
The 2750-sq-km Similipal National Park (www.similipal.org; per day Indian/foreigner
₹40/1000, camera per 3 days ₹50/100; hOct–mid-Jun) has long been Odisha’s prime wildlife sanctuary. However, due to several issues, including ongoing Maoist activity in the region, the park has been off-limits to foreign tourists in recent years. When it is open, there are waterfalls to see and wildlife safaris to take; wild elephants are relatively common, tigers less so.
Mayur Tours & Travels (%9437218602, 253567; mayurtour@rediffmail.com; Lal Bazaar) is a recommended agency in the dusty town of Baripada, which acts as a transport hub for the park. Check the latest with them to see if you can visit.
Ratnagiri
Ratnagiri has the most interesting and extensive ruins (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk). Two large monasteries flourished here from the 6th to 12thcenturies. Noteworthy are an exquisitely carved doorway and the remains of a 10m-high stupa. Stone remains are scattered across the hill here, some still half- buried in the grass, some even dotted around the village. The fine museum (admission ₹5; h9am-5pm Sat-Fri) contains beautiful sculptures from all the three sites.
Udayagiri
Another monastery complex is being excavated here in lush surrounds. There’s a large pyramidal brick stupa with a seated Buddha and some beautiful doorjamb carvings. There’s no entry fee, but unhelpful guides may attach themselves to you then ask for a donation (not compulsory). The ruins are a 1km to 2km walk from the main road.
Lalitgiri
Several monastery ruins (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk) are scattered
up a hillside leading to a small museum and a hillock crowned with a shallow stupa. During excavations of the stupa in the 1970s, a casket containing gold and silver relics was found. Like Ratnagiri, Lalitgiri is also notable for its surrounding village atmosphere.

Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary
o Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary
NATURE RESERVE
(www.bhitarkanika.org; Indian/foreigner per day ₹20/1000, camera/video ₹50/1000; h1 Oct-30 Apr)
Three rivers flow out to sea at Bhitarkanika forming a tidal maze of muddy creeks and mangroves. This is India’s second largest mangrove region after the Sunderbans, and most of the 672-sq-km delta forms this wonderful sanctuary, a significant biodiversity hotspot. The only way to get around most of the sanctuary is by boat, and the main reason to come is to spot some of the hundreds of crocodiles that make these rivers their home.
There are three types: long-snouted gharials, short squat muggers, and the enormous estuarine crocodiles, or ‘salties’, which bask on mud flats before diving into the water for cover as your boat chugs past.
The best time to visit is from December to February, but you’ll see crocs all year round, and may also see monitor lizards, spotted deer, wild boar and all sorts of birds, including eight species of brilliantly coloured kingfisher. Herons arrive in early June and nest until early December, when they move on to Chilika Lake, while raucous open-billed storks have set up a permanent rookery here.
It’s also worth knowing that this area has the highest concentration of king cobras found anywhere in India, though hopefully you won’t meet any of those.The park entrance is at the beautiful, but very poor, mud-hut village of Dangmal (pronounced 'Dang-ger-mal').
4 Sleeping & Eating There are only two places to stay in
Dangmal.

GUESTHOUSE
The Forestry Department–run Forest Rest House is located just inside the sanctuary’s main gate. Annoyingly, rooms have to be prebooked through the Divisional Forest Officer (%9437037370, 06729-242460; Rajnagar) at Rajnagar village, about an hour’s drive back up the road. Cheaper rooms are available for Indian tourists.

CAMPGROUND
(%9437016054; www.bhitarkanikatour.com; s/d/tr/q incl meals ₹2000/4000/5000/6000)S
A special experience awaits at this small, privately run tented camp at the heart of Dangmal village, built with the help of villagers, with a sustainable foot on the ground and just 200m before the sanctuary gate. The stylish Swiss Cottage tents are fully equipped with electricity, fans, sit-down flush toilets and pleasant terraces, and the wonderful rustic Odishan cuisine is almost worth the trip alone. Nature Camp happily welcomes walk-in guests, though you’d be wise to book, given the lack of other options.
You can organise boat trips here for only slightly more than if dealing directly at the park gate. A popular trip is the half-day morning tour (₹3500 per boat, up to 18 people), which includes a nature hike around the forests after the boat trip. Tours which include pick-up and drop-off in Bhubaneswar (two/three/four people ₹6700/4800/3900 per person, all inclusive) can also be arranged.
8 Information Permits (bring a copy of your passport), park entrance tickets and boat trips (₹2500 to ₹3000 per boat) can all be arranged in Dangmal at the park gate.8 Getting There & Away Getting here is a bit of a mission, but the beautiful countryside scenery along the final, single-lane road leading to Dangmal makes it worthwhile.
Two or three direct buses to Dangmal leave from Cuttack between noon and 1pm. Otherwise, frequent buses go from Cuttack to Pattamundai (₹60, three hours), from where you can catch onward buses to Dangmal (₹40, 2½ hours, last bus 5pm), passing Rajnagar en route.
There are three early-morning buses from Dangmal. The 5am and 7am both go as far as Kendrapara (a small town, just past Pattamundai), from where you can catch onward transport to Cuttack or Chandikhol (for the Pusphagiri Ruins). The 6am bus goes all the way to Cuttack. After that, you’ll have to catch an autorickshaw from Dangmal to Rajnagar (around ₹500) from where the last bus to Cuttack leaves at 2pm.
The really adventurous might like to take the 4pm ferry (called a ‘launch’ in these parts) from Nalitapatia jetty (2km walk up the road from Dangmal) to Chandibali (₹16, 1½ hours), where you can find cheap guesthouses and onward buses in the morning to Bhadrak, which is on the main highway between Cuttack and Kolkata.Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh

Madhya Pradesh & ChhattisgarhWhy Go?
The spotlight doesn’t hit Madhya Pradesh (MP) with quite the same brilliance as it does on its more celebrated neighbouring states, which is why it rewards travellers with unparalleled opportunities to detour from the tourist trail and delve into India’s heartland.
Khajuraho’s temples boast some of the finest stone carvings in India, but these exquisite erotic sculptures are a mere slice of architectural wonder in a region blessed with palaces, forts and stupas, the former most gloriously prominent in the postcard-perfect village of Orchha. Tigers are the other big attraction, and your chances of spotting a wild Royal Bengal in MP’s national parks are as good as anywhere in India.
Laid-back traveller havens like Maheshwar and Omkareshwar display the spiritual, scenic and chilled-out flavours for which India is renowned, while the adventurous can foray into tribal Chhattisgarh, which split from Madhya Pradesh in 2000 and remains fascinatingly far removed from mainstream Indian culture.
When to GoA Nov–Feb The most pleasant time to visit central India, despite chilly mornings.

History
Virtually all phases of Indian history made their mark on the region historically known as Malwa, starting with the rock paintings at Bhimbetka and Pachmarhi, which date back more than 10,000 years. They tell of a cultural succession through the late Stone Age to the start of recorded Indian history in the 3rd century BC, when the Buddhist emperor Ashoka controlled the Mauryan empire from Malwa and built Sanchi’s Great Stupa.
The Mauryas were followed by the Sungas and the Guptas – Chandragupta II (r AD 382–401) ruled from Ujjain and had the caves cut at Udaigiri – before the Huns rampaged across the state. Around 1000 years ago the Parmaras reigned in southwest Madhya Pradesh – notably Raja Bhoj, who ruled for over half a century across this region and who founded the now ruined town of Bhojpur thecentury across this region and who founded the now-ruined town of Bhojpur, the magnificent fort of Mandu and, according to some scholars, the city of Bhopal.
The Chandelas ruled over much of central India from the 9th to the 13th centuries. It was their nimble-fingered sculptors who enlivened the facades of some 85 temples in Khajuraho with erotic scenes before the dynasty eventually moved its capital from Khajuraho to Mahoba. Between the 12th and 16th centuries, the region experienced continuing struggles between Hindu and Muslim rulers, and Mandu was the scene of some decisive clashes. The Mughals were eventually superseded by the Marathas after a 27-year war (1681–1707) – the longest in India’s history. The Marathas went on to rule the region for more than a century before they fell to the British (1818), for whom the Scindia maharajas of Gwalior were powerful allies.
With the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, several former states were combined to form Madhya Pradesh. In 2000, Chhattisgarh became an independent state.
NORTHERN MADHYA PRADESH
Gwalior
%0751 / Pop 1.05 million
Famous for its medieval hilltop fort, and described by Mughal emperor Babur as ‘the pearl amongst fortresses in India’, Gwalior makes an interesting stop en route to some of the better-known destinations in this part of India. The city also houses the elaborate Jai Vilas Palace, the historic seat of the Scindias, one of the country’s most revered families.
History
Gwalior’s legendary beginning stems from the 8th century when a hermit known as Gwalipa is said to have cured the Rajput chieftain, Suraj Sen, of leprosy using water from Suraj Kund tank (which remains in Gwalior Fort). Renaming the chieftain Suhan Pal, Gwalipa foretold that Suhan’s descendants would remain in power as long as they retained the name Pal. Suhan’s next 83 descendants did just that but number 84 changed his name to Tej Karan and naturally lost hisjust that, but number 84 changed his name to Tej Karan and, naturally, lost his kingdom.
In 1398 the Tomar dynasty came to power. Gwalior Fort became the focus of continual clashes with neighbouring powers and reached its ascendancy under Raja Man Singh (r 1486–1516). Two centuries of Mughal rule followed, ending with the fort’s capture by the Marathas in 1754.
Over the next 50 years the fort changed hands several times, including twice to the British, before finally passing to the Scindias.
During the First War of Independence (Indian Uprising) in 1857, Maharaja Jayajirao remained loyal to the British, but his troops rebelled, and in mid-1858 the fort was the scene of some of the uprising’s final events. Near here the British defeated rebel leader Tantia Topi and it was in the final assault on the fort that the rani (wife) of Jhansi was killed.Gwalior1 Top Sights

Perched majestically on top of a 3km-long plateau overlooking Gwalior, this
8th-century hilltop fort is an imposing, eye-catching sight, with the circular towers of the dominating Man Singh Palace ringed with turquoise tiles. Much of the fort is now occupied by the prestigious private Scindia School, established by Maharaja Madhavrao Scindia in 1897 for the education of Indian nobility.
There are two approaches to the fort, both of which are steep treks.
Autorickshaws can drive you up to Urvai Gate ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), the
western entrance, so it’s tempting to go that way because vehicles cannot drive up from the eastern entrance. But the western entrance is an anticlimax compared with the formidable view of the fort from the eastern approach, which makes entering from the east well worth the climb. Don’t, however, miss the rock sculptures, which are part of the way down the western side.

Mostly cut into the cliff face in the mid-15th century, they represent nude figures of tirthankars (the 24 great Jain teachers). They were defaced by Babur’s Muslim army in 1527, but have been more recently repaired.

These – and mosaic tiling of elephants, tigers and crocodiles in blue, yellow and green – give it its alternative identity of Chit Mandir (Painted Palace).

The museum occupies some 35 rooms of the Scindias’ opulent Jai Vilas Palace, built by Maharaja Jayajirao in 1874 using prisoners from the fort. The convicts were rewarded with the 12-year job of weaving the hall carpet, one of the largest in Asia.
Supposedly, eight elephants were suspended from the durbar (royal court) hall ceiling to check it could cope with two 12.5m-high, 3.5-tonne chandeliers, each with 250 light bulbs – said to be the largest pair in the world.
Bizarre items fill the rooms: cut-glass furniture, stuffed tigers and a ladies- only swimming pool with its own boat. The cavernous dining room displays the pièce de résistance, a model railway with a silver train that carried after-dinner brandy and cigars around the table.

SHIVPURI’S MARBLE CENOTAPHS
A possible day trip from Gwalior is to the old Scindia summer capital of Shivpuri. This rarely visited town is the site of the Scindia family’s chhatris (cenotaphs), appropriately grand memorials to maharajas and maharanis gone by.
Two kilometres’ walk from the bus stand (autorickshaw ₹30), and set in formal gardens, the chhatris (admission ₹40, camera/video ₹10/40; h8am-noon & 3-8pm) are magnificent walk-in marble structures with Mughal-style pavilions and sikharas (Hindu temple spires) facing each other across a pool with a criss-cross of walkways. The chhatrito Madhorao Scindia, built between 1926 and 1932, is exquisitely inlaid with intricate pietra dura (marble inlay work).
Buses leave regularly from the Shivpuri bus stand for Gwalior (₹110, 2½ hours) and Jhansi (₹95, three hours), meaning you don’t have to backtrack.

Orchha
%07680 / Pop 10,200
This historic village, on the banks of the boulder-strewn Betwa River, showcases a supreme display of Mughal architecture, some of which is similar to that of nearby Khajuraho (albeit without such high-quality artistry) and with much grander palaces and cenotaphs dotting the pastoral landscape as well. The atmosphere in Orchha, though, is far more laid-back and hassle-free, which makes for a relaxing stay. There are great homestay options as well as opportunities to enjoy the surrounding countryside, with walking, cycling and rafting all on the agenda.
History
Orchha was the capital of the Bundela rajas from the 16th century to 1783, when they decamped to nearby Tikamgarh. Bir Singh Deo ruled from Orchha between 1605 and 1627, and built Jhansi Fort. A favourite of Mughal prince Salim, BirSingh feuded with Salim’s father, Emperor Akbar, who all but ruined his kingdom.Orchha

Palaces
Crossing the granite bridge from the village centre over the often dry water channel brings you to a fortified complex dominated by two wonderfully imposing 17th-century palaces – Jehangir Mahal and Raj Mahal. If you look closely at the top of some buildings, you can still see some of the few remaining turquoise-coloured tiles that once decorated the palaces here.

Those interested in Orchha’s history will be the most enthusiastic about this tall tale that dramatically sets Raj Mahal alight under the stars. The story has it all – galloping horses, lion attacks, war, infidelity, attempted suicide and murder – but it still struggles to hold the attention of all but the most serious of historians.Downhill from the palace compound are the smaller Raj Praveen Mahal (

VILLAGE IMMERSION HOMESTAYS IN GANJ
o Friends of Orchha
(%9993385405; www.orchha.org; s/d from ₹600/800, meals ₹50-220; W)S
HOMESTAY
Thanks to Friends of Orchha, a nonprofit organisation run by Dutchman Louk Vreeswijk and his Indian wife, Asha D’Souza, travellers have the opportunity to stay with local people in the village of Ganj.
This is a wonderful chance to experience Indian village life, so don’t expect luxury, although the rooms – spread close by one another around the village – are better and more charming than a lot of budget hotels. The eight rooms offer insulated walls and tiled roofs and are equipped with fans and mosquito nets. Facilities vary, but most have running water and sit-down flush toilets, and others have dry-composting squat toilets or a squat toilet linked to a bio-gas digester.
Friends of Orchha helped provide loans for some renovations, including installing ecofriendly dry toilets in the yards of each homestay house, but you will still be staying in mud huts and eating simple meals that your host family eats every day (veg and nonveg available). The interaction with villagers and immersion into village life is priceless (so stay off the wi-fi, which is ₹100 per day) and you can hop on one of their bikes (₹50 per day) when you need to explore Orchha.
Staying for a single night is discouraged for logistical reasons. If you really want to stay one night only, you can, but room rates will be slightly higher. In any case, the slow pace of life in Ganj is something that should be savoured.
Friends of Orchha also runs an after-school youth club for village children. Options to volunteer and donate are available. The Friends of Orchha office is in Ganj Village itself, on the left-hand side of the main road as you are coming from Orchha. It’s about 1.5km from the main drag.

8 Getting There & Around
BUS
There are no buses between Orchha and Khajuraho. To get there you will first need to go to Jhansi; tempos (₹20) go between Orchha and the Jhansi bus stand all day or a private autorickshaw costs ₹200. From here, catch a bus to Chhatarpur (₹130, three hours, hourly 5am to 10pm), where you can switch for Khajuraho (₹50, 1½ hours). Alternatively, taxis to Khajuraho cost ₹2300. Coming from Khajuraho, you can ask the bus driver to drop you off at the Orchha turn-off on the National Hwy, where you should be able to wave down a vehicle to take you to Orchha.
TRAIN
You can take a slow passenger train (number 51821) to Khajuraho from Orchha’s tiny train station, which is on the Jhansi Rd, about 3km from the village centre. The train leaves daily at 7.25am and takes five hours (if it’s on time). It has 2nd-class seats only so you can’t reserve tickets. Just turn up at the station and buy a ‘general’ ticket (₹40). The return train leaves Khajuraho at 12.30pm.
Khajuraho
%07686 / Pop 23,200
The erotic carvings that swathe Khajuraho’s three groups of Unesco World Heritage–listed temples are among the finest temple art in the world. The Western Group of temples, in particular, contains some stunning sculptures.
Many travellers complain about the tiring persistence of touts here, and the village is fully on the tour bus map. Their complaints are well founded, but its not so bad that you should contemplate missing out on these beautiful temples.History
Legend has it that Khajuraho was founded by Chardravarman, the son of the moon god Chandra, who descended and saw a beautiful maiden as she bathed in a stream. Historians tell us that most of the 85 original temples (of which 25 remain) were built from AD 950 to 1050 during the Chandela dynasty, and they remained active long after the Chandelas moved their capital to Mahoba.
Khajuraho’s isolation may well have helped preserve it from the desecration Muslim invaders inflicted on ‘idolatrous’ temples elsewhere, but perhaps for the same reason the area was slowly abandoned and eventually fell into ruin, letting the jungle take over. The wider world remained largely ignorant until British officer TS Burt was apparently guided to the ruins by his palanquin bearers in

Temples
The temples are superb examples of Indo-Aryan architecture, but it’s their liberally embellished carvings that have made Khajuraho famous. Around the outsides of the temples are bands of exceedingly artistic stonework showing a storyboard of life a millennium ago – gods, goddesses, warriors, musicians, and real and mythological animals.
Two elements appear repeatedly – women and sex. Sensuous, posturing surasundaris (heavenly nymphs), apsaras (dancing surasundaris) and nayikas (mortal surasundaris) have been carved with a half-twist and slight sideways lean that make the playful figures dance and swirl out from the temple. The mithuna (pairs, threesomes etc of men and women depicted in erotic poses) display the great skill of the sculptors and the dexterity of the Chandelas.
Western Group – Inside the Fenced Enclosure Khajuraho’s most striking and best-preserved temples are those within the fenced-off
section of the Western Group (Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk)
and are the only temples you need to pay to see. An Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) guidebook to Khajuraho (₹60) and a 1½-houraudio guide (₹100) are available at the ticket office. If you’d like a guide, official government prices are ₹900 for a half day and ₹1140 for a full day for up to five people, plus a ₹360 to ₹480 language allowance.

The large Lakshmana Temple took 20 years to build and was completed in about AD 954 during the reign of Dhanga, according to an inscribed slab in the mandapa (pillared pavilion in front of a temple). It’s arguably the best preserved of all the Khajuraho temples.
You’ll see carvings of battalions of soldiers here – the Chandelas were generally at war when they weren’t inventing new sexual positions. On the south side is a highly gymnastic orgy, including one gentleman proving that a horse can be a man’s best friend, while a shocked figure peeks out from behind her hands. More sensuous figures intertwine between the elephants in the frieze ringing the basement, while some superb carvings can be found around the garbhagriha (inner sanctum). Lakshmana is dedicated to Vishnu, although it’s similar in design to the Shiva temples Vishvanath and Kandariya-Mahadev.

HINDU TEMPLE
(

 )
The 30.5m-long Kandariya-Mahadev, built between 1025 and 1050, is the largest temple and represents the high point of Chandelan architecture. It alsohas the most representations of female beauty and sexual acrobatics. There are 872 statues, most nearly 1m high – taller than those at the other temples. One frequently photographed sculpture illustrates the feasibility of the handstand position.
The 31m-high sikhara here is, like linga, a phallic Shiva symbol, worshipped by Hindus hoping to seek deliverance from the cycle of reincarnation. It’s decorated with 84 subsidiary spires, which make up a mountain-like rooftop scene reminiscent of the Himalayan abode of the gods.
Mahadeva
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
Mahadeva, a small ruined temple on the same platform as Kandariya-Mahadev and Devi Jagadamba, is dedicated to Shiva, who is carved on the lintel of its doorway. It houses one of Khajuraho’s finest sculptures – a sardula (mythical beast – part lion, part other animal – possibly human) caressing a 1m-high woman.
Devi Jagadamba
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
Devi Jagadamba was originally dedicated to Vishnu, but later to Parvati and then Kali. The carvings include sardulas accompanied by Vishnu, surasundaris, and mithunas frolicking in the third uppermost band. Its three-part design is simpler than Kandariya-Mahadev and Chitragupta. It has more in common with Chitragupta, but is less embellished with carvings so is thought to be a little older.
Chitragupta
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
North of Devi Jagadamba, Chitragupta (1000–25) is unique in Khajuraho – and rare among North Indian temples – in being dedicated to the sun god Surya. While its condition is not as good as the other temples, it has some fine carvings of apsaras and surasundaris, elephant fights and hunting scenes, mithuna and a procession of stone-carriers. In the inner sanctum, Surya drives his seven-horsechariot, while in the central niche on the south facade is an 11-headed statue of Vishnu, representing the god and 10 of his 22 incarnations.
Parvati Temple

Continuing around the enclosure from Chitragupta, the closed-up Parvati Temple is on your right, a small temple originally dedicated to Vishnu and now with an image of Gauri riding a godha (iguana).
Vishvanath Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 )
Believed to have been built in 1002, the Vishvanath Temple is reached by steps on the northern and southern sides. Elephants flank the southern steps. Vishvanath anticipates Kandariya-Mahadev, with which it shares saptamattrikas (seven mothers) flanked by Ganesh and Virabhandra, and is another superlative example of Chandelan architecture. Its sculptures include sensuous surasundari writing letters, cuddling babies and playing music while languishing more provocatively than at other temples.
At the other end of the platform, a 2.2m-long statue of Nandi (

 ), Shiva’s bull vehicle, faces the temple. The basement of the 12-
pillared shrine is decorated with an elephant frieze that recalls similar work on Lakshmana’s facade.

Skirting the southern boundary of the fenced enclosure, Matangesvara is the only temple in the Western Group still in everyday use. It may be the plainest temple here (suggesting an early construction), but inside it sports a polished 2.5m-high lingam (phallic image of Shiva). From its platform you can peer into an open-air storage facility scattered with temple finds, but it’s not open to the public.
Chausath Yogini
HINDU TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
The ruins of Chausath Yogini, beyond Shiv Sagar, date to the late 9th century and are probably the oldest at Khajuraho. Constructed entirely of granite, it’s theonly temple not aligned east to west. The temple’s name means 64 – it once had 64 cells for the yoginis (female attendants) of Kali, while the 65th sheltered the goddess herself. It’s reputedly India’s oldest yogini temple.

A further 600m west from Chausath Yogini, down a track and across a couple of fields (just ask the locals), is the sandstone-and-granite Lalguan Mahadev Temple (AD 900), a small ruined shrine to Shiva.
Eastern Group – Old Village Temples
The Eastern Group includes three Hindu temples scattered around the old village and four Jain temples further south, three of which are in a walled enclosure.
Hanuman Temple

The Hanuman Temple contains a 2.5m-tall statue of the Hindu monkey god. It’s little more than a bright orange shrine, but the interest is in the pedestal inscription dating to AD 922, the oldest dateable inscription in Khajuraho.
Brahma Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
The granite Brahma Temple, with its sandstone sikhara overlooking Narora Sagar, is one of the oldest in Khajuraho, dating from about AD 900. The four- faced lingam in the sanctum led to it being incorrectly named, but the image of Vishnu above the sanctum doorway reveals its original dedication to Vishnu.
Javari Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
Resembling Chaturbhuja Temple in the southern group, Javari Temple (1075– 1100) stands just north of the old village. It’s dedicated to Vishnu and is a good example of small-scale Khajuraho architecture for its crocodile-covered entrance and slender sikhara.Vamana Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
Vamana Temple (1050–75), 200m further north of Javari Temple, is dedicated to the dwarf incarnation of Vishnu. It has quirky touches such as elephants protruding from the walls, but its sikhara is devoid of subsidiary spires and there are few erotic scenes. Its roofed mahamandapa (main hall) is an anomaly in Khajuraho but typical among medieval west Indian temples.
Ghantai Temple
JAIN TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 )
Located between the old village and the Jain Enclosure, the small Ghantai Temple, also Jain, is named after the ghanta (chain and bell) decorations on its pillars. It was once similar to nearby Parsvanath, but only its pillared shell remains, and it’s normally locked.

Parsvanath Temple
JAIN TEMPLE

While not competing in size and erotica with the western-enclosure temples, Parsvanath Temple, the largest of the Jain temples in the walled enclosure, is notable for the exceptional precision of its construction as well as for its sculptural beauty. Some of the best preserved of Khajuraho’s most famous images can be seen here, including the woman removing a thorn from her foot and another applying eye make-up, both on the southern side.
Although the temple was originally dedicated to Adinath, a jet-black image of Parsvanath was substituted about a century ago. Both an inscription on the mahamandapa doorway and its similarities with the slightly simpler Lakshmana Temple date it to AD 950–70.

Adjacent to Parsvanath Temple, the smaller Adinath has been partially restoredover the centuries. With fine carvings on its three bands of sculptures, it’s similar to Khajuraho’s Hindu temples, particularly Vamana. Only the striking black image in the inner sanctum triggers a Jain reminder.

Shanti Nath, built about a century ago, houses components from older temples, including a 4.5m-high Adinath statue with a plastered-over inscription on the pedestal dating to about 1027.

Duladeo Temple

A dirt track runs to the isolated Duladeo Temple, about 1km south of the Jain enclosure. This is the youngest temple, dating to 1100–1150. Its relatively wooden, repetitious sculptures, such as those of Shiva, suggest that Khajuraho’s temple builders had passed their artistic peak by this point, although they had certainly lost none of their zeal for eroticism.
Chaturbhuja Temple

Anticipating Duladeo and its flaws, the ruined Chaturbhuja Temple (c 1100) has a fine 2.7m-high, four-armed statue of Vishnu in the sanctum. It is Khajuraho’s only developed temple without erotic sculptures.
Bijamandala Temple

Just before Chaturbhuja there’s a signed track leading to Bijamandala Temple. This is the excavated mound of an 11th-century temple, dedicated to Shiva (judging by the white marble lingam at the apex of the mound). Although there are some exquisitely carved figures, unfinished carvings were also excavated, suggesting that what would have been Khajuraho’s largest temple was abandoned as resources flaggedabandoned as resources flagged.

CENTRAL MADHYA PRADESH
Bhopal
%0755 / Pop 1.80 millionSplit by a pair of lakes, Bhopal offers two starkly contrasting cityscapes. In the north is the Muslim-dominated old city, a fascinating area of mosques and crowded bazaars. Bhopal’s population is 40% Muslim – one of India’s highest concentration of Muslims – and the women in black niqabs (veils) are reminders of the female Islamic rulers who built up Bhopal in the 19th century. North of here is a reminder of a more recent, tragic history – the Union Carbide chemical plant, site of the world’s worst industrial disaster.
South of the two lakes, Bhopal is more modern, with wide roads, shopping complexes and upmarket hotels and restaurants nestled comfortably in the Arera and Shamla Hills, which overlook the lakes and the old city beyond. The central district here is known as New Market.
The main train and bus stations are just off Hamidia Rd – the main budget hotel area – with the bustling chowk (marketplace) slightly further southeast. Hamidia Rd is accessed via the Platform 5 end of the train station. The Platform 1 end is where you’ll find left luggage (you need your own padlock), MP Tourism, the post office and an ATM.Bhopal

Step through the tribal looking glass at this extremely well-done museum dedicated to the seven tribes and subtribes of Madhya Pradesh. Opened in 2013, the artistic space was built by 1500 tribespeople over 2½ years using no materials from outside their villages. The stunning results are divided into five surreal galleries featuring hyper-examples of tribal life. There’s also a very interesting museum shop.
Afterwards, compliment your visit by popping over to Rashtriya Manav

Bhopal’s third female ruler, Shah Jahan Begum wanted to create the largest mosque in the world, so in 1877 she set about building Taj-ul-Masjid. It was still incomplete at her death in 1901, after funds had been diverted to other projects, and construction did not resume until 1971. Fortress-like terracotta walls surround three gleaming white onion domes and a pair of towering pink minarets with white domes. Try to make the dawn azan (Muslim call to prayer). From Hamidia Rd to Taj-ul-Masjid, an autorickshow costs ₹40.

THE BHOPAL DISASTER: 30 YEARS OF CONTINUING TRAGEDY
At five minutes past midnight on 3 December 1984, 40 tonnes of deadly methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas leaked out over Bhopal from the US-owned Union Carbide chemical plant. Blown by the wind, a 40-foot wall of toxic cloud hugged the ground and coursed through the city. In the ensuing panic, people were trampled trying to escape while others were so disorientated that they ran into the gas.
There were 5295 initial fatalities according to official figures, but the continuing death toll stands at over 25,000. More than 450,000 people suffer from a catalogue of illnesses ranging from hypertension, diabetes and paralysis to premature menopause and skin disorders, while their children experience growth disorders, such as shrunken rib cages. In 2013, according to a water study by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, ground water in 22 communities around the abandoned Union Carbide factory was contaminated with cancer-and birth-defect-causing chemicals, as well as chemicals known to damage the lungs, liver, kidneys and brain.
The leak at the plant was the result of a saga of untested technology, negligent maintenance and cost-cutting measures. Damages of US$3 billion were demanded, and in 1989 Union Carbide paid the Indian government US$470 million. Winning compensation for the victims, however, has been a tortuous process slowed by the Indian government’s wrangling over who was a victim and Dow Chemical’s acquisition of Union Carbide in 2001 Both buyer and seller deny ongoing liabilityUnion Carbide in 2001. Both buyer and seller deny ongoing liability.
A multimillion-dollar hospital was funded by the sale of confiscated shares of Union
Carbide’s Indian subsidiary, while charity Sambhavna Trust Clinic ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ;
%0755-2730904; www.bhopal.org; Berasia Rd, Bafna Colony; h8.30am-3pm), opened in 1996, treats more than 200 Union Carbide victims a day using yoga, ayurvedic treatments, conventional medicine and herbal remedies. Volunteers can work in a range of areas from water testing and medical research to gardening and internet communications; they are hugely appreciated and offered board and lodgings at the medical centre. Visitors are welcome and donations can be made.
Bafna Colony is off Berasia Rd. If walking from Hamidia Rd, turn right after about 500m and keep asking for Sambhavna.
To commemorate the 30th anniversary of the tragedy, the new and at times extremely sombre Remember Bhopal Museum (www.rememberbhopal.net; HIG 22, Housing Board Colony, Berasia Rd, near Triveni Heights; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun) opened in 2014 in New Housing Board Colony near the the now-derelict Union Carbide factory site, preserving the belongings and pictures of victims as well as over 50 audio recording from survivors, doctors and forensic experts.

Excellent service, right down to the errand boys, make this a great option near Hamidia Rd. Newly renovated air-con rooms have new floors, funky-shaped beds and working hot showers. Skip the lowest category; executive non-air-con rooms (from ₹900) are every bit as comfortable as those with air-conditioning.

This former 19th-century palace lost none of its colonial-era charm through its conversion into a top-class hotel. Arched walkways and immaculate lawns lead you to beautifully decorated rooms. The fact that you can sleep in a patio room – perfectly great – for under US$100 in a five-star hotel is ridiculous. Worth a splurge.
There’s a palm-lined pool, an excellent health spa and three restaurants, two bars and a coffee shop.

A standing-room-only crowd swarms this fast-food hotspot day and night for some of Bhopal’s best biryani, but it’s the finger-lickin’, outrageously good chicken tikka, grilled over hot coals before your eyes and dipped in house green- chilli yoghurt sauce, that’s the true showstopper. It’s so cheap, we ordered both.

Jehan Numa Palace’s best restaurant specialises in barbecue kebabs and tandoor. The pankhi chicken kebab (marinated chicken wings) is fall-off-the-bone astonishing, but drowning yourself in flavour with the sampler platter (from

Rising from the plains  46km northeast of Bhopal is a rounded hill topped withRising from the plains, 46km northeast of Bhopal, is a rounded hill topped with some of India’s oldest Buddhist structures.
In 262 BC, repentant of the horrors he had inflicted on Kalinga, in present-day Odisha, the Mauryan emperor Ashoka embraced Buddhism. As a penance he built the Great Stupa at Sanchi, near the birthplace of his wife. A domed edifice used to house religious relics, it was the first Buddhist monument in the region, although many other religious structures followed. Today, the remarkably preserved Great Stupa is the centerpiece of Sanchi’s Buddhist Monuments, a Unesco World Heritage Site. As Hinduism gradually reabsorbed Buddhism, the site decayed and was forgotten, until being rediscovered in 1818 by a British army officer.
Although Sanchi can be visited as a day trip from Bhopal, this crossroads village is a relaxing spot to spend the night, and a number of side trips can be taken from here.Sanchi

Buddhist Monuments
The hilltop Buddhist monuments (Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk)
are reached via a path and stone steps at the end of Monuments Rd (which is a continuation of the road that leaves the train station), where the ticket office (
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; hdawn-dusk) is located. If you don’t want to walk up the
hill, autorickshaws will deposit you at the top for ₹30. If you are interested in a guide, official central government guides mill about and charge ₹1035/1310 for a half-/full day.
If you’re going up to the stupas for sunrise, buy a ticket the day before. Remember, it’s auspicious to walk clockwise around Buddhist monuments.
Stupas
Beautifully proportioned, Stupa 1 (Great Stupa; 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) is the main
structure on the hill, directly in front of you as you enter the complex from the north. Originally constructed by Ashoka, it was later enlarged and the original brick stupa enclosed within a stone one. Presently it stands 16m high and 37m in diameter. Encircling the stupa is a wall with four entrances through magnificently carved toranas (gateways) that are the finest Buddhist works of art in Sanchi, if not India.
Stupa 2 ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) is halfway down the hill to the west (turn
right at Stupa 1). If you come up from the village by the main route you can walk back down via Stupa 2, although be prepared for some fence-hopping at the bottom. Instead of gateways, ‘medallions’ decorate the surrounding wall – naive in design, but full of energy and imagination. Flowers, animals and people – some mythological – ring the stupa.
Stupa 3 ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) is northeast of the Great Stupa (you pass it on
your left as you approach the Great Stupa from the main entrance) and similar in design, though smaller, with a single, rather fine gateway. It once contained relics of two important disciples of Buddha: Sari Puttha and Maha Moggallana.They were moved to London in 1853 but returned in 1953 and are now kept in the modern vihara (resting place).
Only the base is left of the 2nd-century-BC Stupa 4 ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ),
which stands behind Stupa 3. Between Stupas 1 and 3 is the small Stupa 5 (
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), unusual in that it once contained a statue of Buddha, now
displayed in the museum.
Toranas (Gateways)
The Great Stupa’s four toranas were erected around 35 BC, but had all fallen down by the time the site was rediscovered. They have since been repositioned. Scenes carved onto the pillars and their triple architraves are mainly tales from the Jatakas, episodes from Buddha’s various lives.
At this stage in Buddhist art, Buddha himself was never represented directly – only his presence was alluded to through symbols. The lotus stands for his birth, the bodhi tree for his enlightenment, the wheel for his teachings, and the footprint and throne for his presence. The stupa itself also symbolises Buddha.
Northern Gateway
GATE
 
The Northern Gateway, topped by a broken wheel of law, is the best preserved of the toranas. Scenes include a monkey offering a bowl of honey to Buddha, who is represented by a bodhi tree.
Another panel depicts the Miracle of Sravasti – one of several miracles represented here – in which Buddha, again in the form of a bodhi tree, ascends a road into the air. Elephants support the architraves above the columns, while delicately carved yakshis (maidens) hang nonchalantly on each side.
Eastern Gateway
GATE
 
The breathtakingly carved figure of a yakshi, hanging from an architrave on the Eastern Gateway, is one of Sanchi’s best-known images. One of the pillars, supported by elephants, features scenes from Buddha’s entry to nirvana. Another shows Buddha’s mother Maya’s dream, which she had when he was conceived,of an elephant standing on the moon.
Across the front of the middle architrave is the Great Departure, when Buddha (a riderless horse) renounced the sensual life and set out to find enlightenment.
Southern Gateway
GATE
 
The back-to-back lions supporting the Southern Gateway, the oldest gateway, form the state emblem of India, which can be seen on every banknote. The gateway narrates Ashoka’s life as a Buddhist, with scenes of Buddha’s birth and another representation of the Great Departure.
Also featured is the Chhaddanta Jataka, a story in which Bodhisattva (Buddha before he had reached enlightenment) took on the form of an elephant king who had six tusks. The less favoured of the elephant king’s two wives was so jealous of the other that she decided to starve herself to death, vowing to come back to life as the queen of Benares in order to have the power to avenge her husband’s favouritism. Her wish came true, and as queen she ordered hunters to track down and kill the elephant king. A hunter found the great elephant but before he could kill it, the elephant handed over his tusks, an act so noble it led to the queen dying of remorse.
Western Gateway
GATE
 
Pot-bellied dwarves support the architraves of the Western Gateway, which has some of the site’s most interesting scenes. The top architrave shows Buddha in seven different incarnations, manifested three times as a stupa and four times as a tree.
The rear of one pillar shows Buddha resisting the Temptation of Mara (the Buddhist personification of evil, often called the Buddhist devil), while demons flee and angels cheer.
Pillars
Of the scattered pillar remains, the most important is Pillar 10 ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ), erected by Ashoka but later broken. Two upper sections of thisbeautifully proportioned and executed shaft lie side by side behind Stupa 1; the
capital (head of the pillar, usually sculpted) is in the museum. Pillar 25 (

Temple 18 (

like Temple 17 (

GOOGLE MAP
 ), beside Stupa 5, was built
in the 6th or 7th century, but reconstructed during the 10th or 11th century. It contains a well-executed image of Buddha.
Monasteries
The earliest monasteries were made of wood and are long gone. The usual plan was of a central courtyard surrounded by monastic cells. These days only the
courtyards and stone foundations remain. Monasteries 45 and 47 ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ), standing on the eastern ridge to the left of Stupa 1, date from the
transition from Buddhism to Hinduism, with strong Hindu elements in their design. The former has two sitting Buddhas. The one housed inside is exceptional.

Every half-hour buses connect Sanchi with Bhopal (₹45, 1½ hours, 6am to 10pm) and Vidisha (₹10, 20 minutes, 6am to 11pm). Catch them at the village crossroads.
TRAIN
Train is a decent option for getting to Sanchi from Bhopal. It takes less than an hour so there’s no need to book a seat: just turn up with enough time to queue for a ‘general’ ticket (₹10 to ₹30) and then squeeze on. At least four daily trains leave from Bhopal (8am, 10am, 3.05pm, and 6.15pm) and four run in the other direction (8am, 10.30am, 4.30pm and 7.30pm) from Sanchi.Around Sanchi
Vidisha
%07592 / Pop 155,959
This small but thriving market town, 8km northeast of Sanchi, was a commercial centre in the 5th and 6th centuries BC. These days it’s an interesting place for a wander or a chai break en route to the Udaigiri Caves.
Many of the attractive whitewashed or painted buildings still have old wooden balconies that overlook the market streets where horse-drawn carts share space with scooters and rickshaws. There are also a number of brightly coloured temples dotted around the old town, which is located to the left of the main road from Sanchi.
Past the town, and over the railway line, is the dusty District Museum (Sagar-
Vidisha Rd; Indian/foreigner ₹5/50, camera ₹50; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun), which houses some
beautiful sculptures recovered from local sites, the most impressive of which is a 3m-high, 2nd-century-BC stone statue of Kuber Yaksha (treasurer of the gods), on display as you enter.
It’s a straightforward 30-minute cycle from Sanchi or else there are frequent buses (₹10, 20 minutes).
Udaigiri Caves
Cut into a sandstone hill, about 5km northwest of Vidisha, are some 20 Gupta cave shrines (hdawn-dusk), which date from the reign of Chandragupta II (AD 382–401). Most are Hindu but two, near the top of the hill, are Jain (Caves 1 and 20) – unfortunately both are closed due to unsafe roofs.
In Cave 4 is a lingam bearing Shiva’s face complete with a third eye. Cave 5 contains the finest carving – a superb image of Vishnu in his boar incarnation topped with a frieze of gods, who also flank the entrance to Cave 6. Lotus- ceilinged Cave 7 was cut out for the personal use of Chandragupta II. On the top of the hill are ruins of a 6th-century Gupta temple dedicated to the sun god.
To get here by bike from Sanchi, head towards Vidisha, but turn left about1km before the town, following a sign for Udaigiri. Follow the road to the Betwa River, cross the river then take the first left and keep going until you reach the caves. Alternatively, take a bus to Vidisha then a rickshaw (₹150 return). A return rickshaw from Sanchi is about ₹400.
If you want to cycle back via Vidisha, cross back over the river and keep going straight instead of bearing round to the right on the road you took from Sanchi.
Heliodorus Pillar
The Heliodorus Pillar (Khamb Baba), just beyond the Udaigiri Caves turn-off, was erected by a Greek ambassador, Heliodorus from Taxila (now in Pakistan), in about 140 BC, and dedicated to Vasudeva. The pillar is worshipped by local fishermen who chain themselves to the pillar on full-moon nights. It’s said they then become possessed and are able to drive evil spirits from other locals. When someone has been exorcised, they drive a nail into the tamarind tree nearby, fixing to it a lime, a piece of coconut, a red thread and supposedly the spirit. The large tree is bristling with old nails.
The pillar is close to the Udaigiri Caves. Once you cross the Betwa River, carry straight on, rather than turning left for the caves, and you’ll soon see a sign directing you up a small lane on your right, which leads to the pillar.
Pachmarhi

Madhya Pradesh’s only hill station is surrounded by waterfalls, cave temples and the forested ranges of the Satpura Tiger Reserve and offers a refreshing escape from steamy central India.
Even if you don’t go on an organised trek or 4WD safari, you can easily spend a couple of days here cycling or hiking to the numerous sights before taking a dip in one of the natural pools that dot the area.
Explorer Captain J Forsyth ‘discovered’ Pachmarhi as late as 1857 and set up India’s first Forestry Department at Bison Lodge in 1862. Soon after, the British army set up regional headquarters here starting an association with the militaryarmy set up regional headquarters here, starting an association with the military that remains today.

Many of the sights in Pachmarhi fall within Satpura National Park; to visit, you’ll need a ticket from the office outside Bison Lodge. This allows entry to Bison Lodge, Bee Falls, Duchess Falls, Reechgarh, Astachal, Ramykund and Rajat Prapat (including Panchuli Kund and Apsara Vihar). Other sights in the area are free with the exception of the Satpuri Tiger Reserve.

NATURE RESERVE
(www.satpura-national-park.com; Indian/foreigner per 4WD ₹2400/4400; h6am-7pm mid-Oct–Jun)
This reserve, entered from Madhai 93km northwest of Pachmarhi by road, counts an estimated 40-odd tigers and unknown number of leopards; chances of sighting the latter, along with Indian gaurs, sloth bears, monkeys, deer and birds of all type, are decent. Safaris can be arranged through agencies, online (www.mponline.gov.in) or at the gate itself.
On top of your 4WD entrance fee, you will need to pay for one guide per vehicle (₹300). The 4WDs hold up to six people in addition to the guide and driver. Boat safaris can also be arranged for up to 10 people (₹4000 per boat, 45 minutes). Accommodation in the reserve is limited and expensive, but there’s an affordable Forest Rest House bookable from Madhai Gate itself.

Chauragarh
 
VIEWPOINT
South of Jaistambha is the road that leads towards Chauragarh (1308m), Madhya Pradesh’s third-highest peak. The Shiva shrine at the top attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims during Shivaratri Mela. On the way, stop at Handi Khoh

 ), also known as Suicide Point, to gawk down the 100m canyon
into the dense forest. You’ll spy Chauragarh in the distance from here as well as Priyadarshini (Forsyth Point), further along the road.
About 3km beyond Priyadarshini the road ends at Mahadeo Cave , where a path 30m into the damp gloom reveals a lingam with attendant priest. This is the beginning of the 1365-step pilgrim trail to Chauragarh (five hours’ return hike).

Ujjain

First impressions don’t always impress. And that’s the case with Ujjain. The area around the train and bus stations is chaotic and nothing special, but wander down towards the river ghats, via Ujjain’s maze of alleyways, and you’ll discover an older, more spiritual side to this city that has been attracting traders and pilgrims for hundreds of years. An undeniable energy pulses through the temples here – perhaps because this is one of Hinduism’s seven sacred cities.
History The Guptas, the Mandu sultans, Maharaja JaiSingh (of Jaipur fame), the Marathas and the Scindias have all had a controlling hand in Ujjain’s long and chequered past, which stretches back to when the city, originally called Avantika, was an important trade stop. When the Scindias moved their capital to Gwalior in 1810, Ujjain’s prominence declined rapidly.

While this is not the most stunning temple, tagging along behind a conga-line through the underground chambers can be magical. At nonfestival times, the marble walkways are a peaceful preamble to the subterranean chamber containing one of India’s 12 sacred Shiva shrines known as jyoti linga – naturally occurring linga believed to derive currents of shakti (creative energies perceived as female deities) from within themselves rather than being ritually invested with mantra-shakti by priests.
The temple was destroyed by Altamish in 1235 and restored by the Scindias in the 19th century. You may be asked to give a donation, but it’s not compulsory.

Muslim pillagers originally stole the sanctum’s silver-plated doors from Somnath Temple in Gujarat and installed them in Ghazni, Afghanistan. Mohammed Shah Abdati later took them to Lahore (in present-day Pakistan), before Mahadji Scindia brought them back here. The alleyways north, east and west of here are wonderful places to explore.

Omkareshwar
%07280 / Pop 10,062
This Om-shaped island attracts pilgrims in large numbers and has become a popular chill-out destination for a certain kind of spiritual traveller. The controversial dam has changed the look of Omkareshwar considerably but thecontroversial dam has changed the look of Omkareshwar considerably, but the island has retained its spiritual vibe and remains a pleasant and authentic – if overly commercialised – pilgrimage point.
Much activity takes place off the island, at the market square called Getti Chowk (from where the old bridge crosses to the island), and on Mamaleshwar Rd, which links Getti Chowk to the bus stand. If you continue straight along Mamaleshwar Rd from the bus stand, without turning left to Getti Chowk, you’ll find steps leading down to the ghats (where you can cross the river on boats for ₹5). Beyond is the new bridge and the dam.
The path leading from the old bridge to Shri Omkar Mandhata temple is the hub of the island.
1 Sights & Activities Tourists can rub shoulders with sadhus in the island’s narrow lanes, browse the colourful stalls selling chillums (hookah pipes) and souvenir linga, or join pilgrims attending the thrice daily puja (prayer) at Shri Omkar Mandhata . This cave-like temple, which houses the only shapeless jyothi lingam (12 important shrines dedicated to Shiva), is one of many Hindu and Jain monuments on the island.
From the old bridge, instead of turning right to Shri Omkar Mandhata, head left and walk up the 287 steps to the 11th-century Gaudi Somnath Temple , from where you can descend the hill to the northern tip of the island, where sadhus bathe in the confluence of the holy Narmada and Keveri Rivers. You can climb the narrow, inner staircase of the temple or just sit and watch the langur monkeys play. Nearby is a 30m-tall Shiva statue.
The path passing in front of the Shiva statue near Gaudi Somnath Temple can be followed back to the ghats (45 minutes), up and down hills and past a number of temple ruins. Don’t miss the beautifully sculpted Siddhanatha Temple (left at the T-junction in the pathway) with marvellous elephant carvings around its base.4 Sleeping & Eating

A special experience awaits at this welcoming guesthouse, where Manu and family treat you like one of their own. Rooms are simple yet well looked after and bathrooms are shared only but kept clean. If you ask in advance, your hosts can whip up a delicious thali (₹100), served village-style on the open-air patio floor. The serene views are inspiring.
This is pretty much the only place to stay on the island itself that isn’t a dharamsala (pilgrims’ rest house). It’s perched midway above the old bridge just to the left of the salmon-coloured temple. It’s hard to find, though. Cross the bridge from Getti Chowk, come around and down the stairs and turn left. After 10m, turn left into a narrow alley with the painted blue wall saying, ‘Kalyan Bhattacharya’, and head around and up a very steep and trashy set of steps. Keep asking the way as you climb and be prepared for the odd territorial dog.

Maheshwar
%07283 / Pop 23,600
The peaceful, riverside town of Maheshwar has long held spiritual significance – it’s mentioned in the Mahabharata and Ramayana under its old name, Mahishmati, and still draws sadhus and yatris (pilgrims) to its ancient ghats and temples on the holy Narmada River. The town enjoyed a golden age in the late 18th century under Holkar queen Ahilyabai, who built the palace in the towering fort and many other monuments. Away from the ghats and historic buildings, Maheshwar’s colourful streets display brightly painted wooden houses with overhanging balconies.
It’s a mesmerising place that packs a lot of punch in a very small area around the ghats, palace and temples – a sort of refined, spit-shined Varanasi in miniature.1 Sights & Activities The town is dominated by a 16th- century fort. The huge, imposing ramparts were built by Emperor Akbar, while the Maheshwar Palace and several temples within its grounds were added during the reign of Holkar queen Ahilyabai (r 1767–95). The palace is part public courtyard, part posh hotel. Nearby is a Shiva temple with a golden lingam – the starting point for palanquin processions on Ahilyabai’s birthday and Dussehra.
From the ramparts of the fort you can see boats (return trip per person/boat ₹50/500) and incense smoke drifting across the water to Baneshwar Temple , located on a tiny island in the middle of the river. Descending to the dhobi- wallahs (clothes washers) at the ghats, you pass two impressive stone temples
. The one on the right, guarded by stone Holkar sentries and a frieze of elephants, houses more images of Ahilyabai and two candle towers, lit during festivals.
Between the palace and the two stone temples a small doorway announces the
NGO Rehwa Society (%07283-273203; www.rehwasociety.org; h10am-6pm Wed-Mon, shop
open daily), a craft cooperative where profits are ploughed back into the education, housing and welfare of the weavers. A local school, run entirely by Rehwa, is behind the workshop. Maheshwar saris are famous for their unique weave and simple, geometric patterns.
You can watch the weavers at work and buy shawls (from ₹2100), saris (₹3000 to ₹11,000), scarves (₹800 to ₹2500) and fabrics made from silk, cotton and wool. Volunteers with some design background are always welcome, as are those interested in volunteering to teach at the school.

Rates include all meals as well as boat trips on the river. Booking ahead is essential. Nonguests who fancy a night to remember should not miss dining here. The sumptuous menu is set, as is the ₹1575 per person price (including alcohol), and all the food comes from the on-site, nearly 100% organic gardens.

From there flag down a bus (₹15, 30 minutes) or hitch the final 14km to Mandu.
Mandu
%07292 Pop 10,300 Elev 634m
Perched on top of a pleasantly green, thinly forested 20-sq-km plateau, picturesque Mandu is home to some of India’s finest examples of Afghan architecture as well as impressive baobab trees, originally from Africa. The area is littered with palaces, tombs, monuments and mosques that have been declared Unesco World Heritage sites. Some cling to the edge of ravines, others arebeside lakes, while Rupmati’s Pavilion, the most romantic of them all, sits majestically at the far end of the plateau, overlooking the vast plains below.
History Raja Bhoj, of Bhopal fame, founded Mandu as a fortress retreat in the 10th century before it was conquered by the Muslim rulers of Delhi in 1304. When the Mughals captured Delhi in 1401, the Afghan Dilawar Khan, governor of Malwa, set up his own little kingdom and Mandu’s golden age began.
Although Dilawar Khan established Mandu as an independent kingdom, it was his son, Hoshang Shah, who shifted the capital from Dhar to Mandu and raised it to its greatest splendour.
In 1526, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat conquered Mandu, only to be ousted in 1534 by the Mughal Humayun, who in turn lost the kingdom to Mallu Khan, an officer of the Khalji dynasty. Ten more years of feuds and invasions saw Baz Bahadur eventually emerge in the top spot, but in 1561 he fled Mandu to avoid facing Akbar’s advancing troops.
After Akbar added Mandu to the Mughal empire, it kept a considerable degree of independence, until taken by the Marathas in 1732. The capital of Malwa was then shifted back to Dhar, and the slide in Mandu’s fortunes that had begun with the absconding of Baz Bahadur became a plummet.Mandu1 Sights Archaeological Museum

Dating from the 15th century, this is the most famous building in Mandu. Built on a narrow strip of land between Munja and Kapur tanks, with a small upper storey like a ship’s bridge (use your imagination), it’s far longer (120m) than it is wide (15m). Ghiyas-ud-din, who is said to have had a harem of 15,000 maidens, constructed its lookouts, scalloped arches, airy rooms and beautiful pleasure pools.

The house is within the enclave, but the shop is outside on the road to Delhi Gate. As the buildings’ size and internal workmanship suggest, their owner wasmore than a shopkeeper. His name, which means ‘beggar master’, is thought to identify him as Rajput chief Medini Ray, a powerful minion of the sultans. The ‘shop’ was a warehouse for saffron and musk, imported and sold at a handsome profit when there were enough wealthy people to shop here.

 )
Entered by a flight of steps leading to a 17m-high domed porch, this disused red- stone mosque dominates the village of Mandu. Hoshang Shah began its construction around 1406, basing it on the great Omayyad Mosque in Damascusin Syria, and Mohammed Khalji completed it in 1454. Despite its plain design, it’s reckoned to be the finest and largest example of Afghan architecture in India.

Reputed to be India’s oldest marble building, this imposing tomb is crowned with a crescent thought to have been imported from Persia or Mesopotamia. Inside, light filters into the echoing dome through stone jalis (carved lattice screens), intended to cast an appropriately subdued light on the tombs. An inscription records Shah Jahan sending his architects – including Ustad Hamid, who worked on the Taj Mahal – here in 1659 to pay their respects to the tomb’s builders.
Ashrafi Mahal

Mohammed Shah originally built his tomb as a madrasa (Islamic college), before converting and extending it. The overambitious design later collapsed – notably the seven-storey circular tower of victory. The building is an empty shell, but intricate Islamic pillarwork can be seen at the top of its great stairway.
Rewa Kund Group
A pleasant 4km-cycle south of the village Mandu, past Sagar Talao, brings you
to two more ruins (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, video ₹25; hdawn-dusk). Tickets for both
should be bought from outside Baz Bahadur’s Palace.
Baz Bahadur’s Palace
PALACE
 
Baz Bahadur was the last independent ruler of Mandu. His palace, constructed around 1509, is beside the Rewa Kund tank where a water lift at the northern end supplied water to the palace. A curious mix of Rajasthani and Mughal styles, it was actually built decades before Baz Bahadur came to power.
Rupmati’s Pavilion
HINDU MONUMENT 
Standing at the top of a cliff plunging 366m to the plains, Rupmati’s Pavilion has a subtle beauty unmatched by the other monuments – and some of the dinkiest stone staircases you’ll ever climb. According to Malwa legends, the music-loving Baz Bahadur built it to persuade a beautiful Hindu singer, Rupmati, to move here from her home on the plains. From its terrace and domed pavilions, Rupmati could gaze down at the distant glint of the sacred Narmada River.
In fact, the pavilion was built in two or three phases and the style of its arches and pillars suggests it was completed 100 years before Rupmati’s time. Nonetheless, the love story is a subject of Malwa folk songs – not least because of its tragic ending. Lured by tales of Rupmati’s beauty, Akbar marched on the fort and Baz Bahadur fled, leaving his lover to poison herself.
This place is simply gorgeous at sunset.
Other Sights
Nil Kanth Palace
HINDU HISTORIC SITE
 
If you’re looking for a great reason to cycle out into the countryside, consider visiting this unusual former palace turned temple. It stands at the head of a ravine, on the site of an earlier Shiva shrine – its name means God with Blue Throat – and is now once again used as a place of worship. A stream built by one of Akbar’s governors trickles through a delightful spiral channel and is usually filled with sweet-scented water.
To get here, cycle south along Main Rd for less than 1km until you see a large white water tower. Turn right here and follow the road as it twists and turns past villages all the way to Nil Kanth (about 2km). You can continue from here, past more remote villages, for about another kilometre to reach the still-standing gateway of the now ruined Songarh Fort, from where there are more great views.

Entered by a kaleidoscopic potpourri of colour, this complex is a splash of kitsch among the Islamic monuments. The richly decorated temples feature marble, silver and gold tirthankars with jade eyes, and behind them is a theme-park-like museum with a walk-on replica of Shatrunjaya, the hilltop temple complex at Palitana in Gujarat. In the colourful murals, bears devour sinners’ arms, crocodiles chew their heads, and demons saw one evil character in half, lengthways.

The best thing about this family-friendly MP Tourism property, 2km south of the village, is morning chai in the lakeside gazebo, watching local fishermen cast their nets over lake Sagar Talao. Otherwise, there are large gardens containing comfortable cottages, children’s play areas, tree swings and a pool, restaurant and bar.
There's no compelling reason to consider upgrading categories here – you won’t gett anything noticeable over the standard rooms.

The subtle canteen-style interior of this no-nonsense diner with plastic tables and chairs is appreciatively understated compared with the gaudy exterior, but it’s the good, honest and cheap food that overshadows both. The menu is extensive and includes solid thalis plus local specialities such as Mandu kofta (dumplingsin a mild sauce).
South Indian breakfasts are also available, as are lassis and coffee. It also has open-air ‘garden’ seating across the street.

If doing this, it’s quicker to get off 14km before Dhar at a junction called Oonera
(₹15, 30 minutes) from where you can flag down Dhamnod-bound buses (₹50, 1½ hours).
8 Getting Around Cycling is the best way to get around, as the terrain is flat, the air clear and the countryside beautiful. We didn’t
see a single autorickshaw on our visit. Ritik Cycles (

If you can’t be fussed with a DIY safari, this agency – inherently involved in tiger conservation – can customise safari tours throughout Eastern MP. Photography wildlife tours are a speciality, but it handles birding and cultural itineraries as well. Five per cent of the profits go towards three tiger-saving NGOs.
Expect to pay from ₹13,500 (budget) to ₹66,000 (top end) per day for custom safaris for two people all-inclusive, depending on a variety of factors (type of vehicle, accommodation, number of 4WD tours, number of days etc). Prices come down for groups of six or more people.

This higher-end Indian chain, the domain of celeb chef Sanjeev Kapoor, might not be top choice in Delhi, but it’s a gastro-godsend in Jabalpur. Creative takeson gourmet Indian fare rule here and everything is a flavour bomb. The khurcha saag murh (chicken tikka in spinach, fenugreek, coloured peppercorns and mustard seeds) was our favourite dish in all of MP.
WORTH A TRIP
MARBLE ROCKS AT BHEDAGHAT
Known locally as Bhedaghat, the magnesium-limestone cliffs at this gorge on the holy Narmada River, 22km west of Jabalpur, change colours in different lights, from pink to black. They’re particularly impressive by moonlight, and parts are floodlit at night.
More pleasant than awe-inspiring (during the day, anyway), the trip up the 2km-long gorge is made in a shared motorboat (per person 30/50min ₹50/70; h7am-7pm, full moon 8pm-midnight, closed 15 Jun-15 Oct due to monsoon) from the jetty at Panchvati Ghat (private boats run ₹750/1500 for the same timeframes). Sticking around? The Dhuandhar (Smoke Cascade) waterfall is a worthwhile 1.5km walk uphill from the ghat. Along the way is the much-revered Chausath Yogini, a circular 10th-century temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Durga and accessed via a steep flight of steps on the right-hand side of the road. Once at the falls, you can take a short cable-car ride (₹75 return) to the other side of the gorge.
Local city buses 203/203A leave regularly for Bhedaghat (₹15, 45 minutes, 8am to 10pm) from Model Rd opposite Jabalpur bus stand. They drop you at a crossroads 100m from Panchvati Ghat (right side of fork). To return, wait at the crossroads for a passing bus or squeeze into Jabalpur-bound shared autorickshaws (₹20).

More than 10 daily trains leave for Satna, from where you can take a bus to Khajuraho. You may have to catch a bus from Satna to Panna and change again for Khajuraho. For Bandhavgarh National Park, take a train to Umaria.8 Getting Around A cycle-rickshaw from the train station to Russel Chowk is ₹25. Autorickshaws are usually double the price.
Kanha National Park
%07649
Madhya Pradesh is the king of the jungle when it comes to tiger parks, and
Kanha (www.kanhanationalpark.com; Indian/foreigner ₹1250/2450, premium zones ₹1850/3650, 4WD from ₹1800, guide ₹300; hmid-Oct–mid-Jun, closed Wed evening) is the most famous. The
forests are vast, and while your chances of seeing a tiger are probably slightly slimmer than at nearby Bandhavgarh, at the time of writing sightings were on the rise. Add to that the fact that you can really go deep into the forest, and you have a complete safari experience, rather than the rush-and-grab outings some complain of at Bandhavgarh.The sal forests and vast meadows contain tigers (89 at last count) and leopards and support huge populations of deer and antelope, including the rare barasingha (deer). You’ll see plenty of langur monkeys, the odd gaur (Indian bison), maybe even a family or two of wild boar and the odd lonesome jackal or two. The park is also home to more than 300 bird species.
Khatiya Gate in Khatiya village is easily the most popular; other gates into the park include Mukki, 45km southeast of Khatiya, and Sarahi, 60km northeast.
Bookings for 4WD safaris are made online (www.mponline.gov.in) up to 120 days in advance, but foreign cards weren’t being accepted at the time of writing. Save yourself immense hassle by allowing hotels/agencies to do this.
Ten percent of safari tickets (14 4WDs) are reserved for gate sales and are sold 30 minutes before opening – but this is a major hassle and lines form as early as midnight the evening prior. Vehicle fees may be higher if you need to drive further to enter from a more distant gate (depending on the zone you are visiting). New park formalities have also been implemented to fiscally discourage walk-ups: if you meet other folks with a reservation and extra space in their 4WD, you cannot just join in and share the costs. For anyone joining a booked reservation, you will pay an add-on fee, which is the park entrance fee per person (rather than per 4WD). So, two foreigners joining a booked group for the premium zone will pay ₹3650 each to join. Note, a 4WD containing Indian nationals and foreigners costs the foreign-tourist price.
There are two safari slots each day: morning (roughly 6am to 11am) and afternoon (roughly 3pm to 6pm). The morning safaris are longer and tend to produce more tiger sightings.
1 Sights & Activities
MP Tourism Canter
(Indian/foreigner ₹1200/3200)
4WD SAFARI
These two 12-seat canters operated by MP Tourism are a last-resort option for getting into the park. They do not stray beyond the Kisli zone.
Nature Trails
WALKING(guide ₹400; h6-11am & 3-6pm)
A well-marked 7km trail leads from just inside Khatiya Gate and skirts along the edge of the park before looping back to the village. Mostly you’ll see a lot of monkeys and birds, but tigers do venture into this area on occasions and an accompanying guide is essential.
4 Sleeping & Eating Most hotels have restaurants. There’s a row of small dhabas just before Khatiya Gate serving cheap thalis (₹80) and chai. If you’re on a morning safari, you can grab breakfast (₹20), tea and coffee when you stop at the interpretation centre inside the park.
Inside the Buffer Zone
Note, while lodgings in the buffer zone enjoy a wonderfully natural forest location, there are none of the facilities that are available in the village outside the park. You’ll need to have a room booked here in advance in order to get past security at Khatiya Gate. If you’re walking-up, book at the MP Tourism Tourist Information Booth next to Khatiya Gate.
Tourist Hostel
(%07649-277310; Kisli Village; American Plan dm ₹1300)
HOSTEL
This MP Tourism property, made up of a few huge, well-kept multibed dorms with clean shared bathrooms and lockers, is inside the buffer zone, right in Kisli village, which leads into the park’s core zone. There are no facilities here apart from the dorms, the nearby canteen and the adjacent Baghira Log Huts (another MP Tourism property).
The attraction is that you’re staying right in among the monkey-filled forest, and a stone’s throw from meadows that attract deer and gaur throughout the day, though you are not allowed to wander far off.

GUESTHOUSE(%07649-277227; www.mptourism.com; Kisli Village; American Plan s/d from ₹4800/6000; a)

Comfortable rather than luxurious log-cabin-lookalike rooms are set among the trees and overlook a beautiful meadow. There’s a restaurant and bar. Note the single price is only available on a walk-up basis, it cannot be booked online.
AMERICAN/JUNGLE PLAN
Many of the resorts at the tiger reserves have part-and all-inclusive packages rather than straight accommodation prices. The so-called American Plan includes accommodation and all meals, while the Jungle Plan includes accommodation and meals plus a morning and an afternoon 4WD safari.

It’s as informative as it is relaxing to stay in this jungle setting where wildlife discussions follow excellent communal meals (Indian for lunch, continental for dinner) and guests retire to rustic-chic lodges slightly scented with essence of English colonialism.
Nature abounds in the fenceless grounds where langur monkeys and chitals make regular appearances, only to be outshined by an occasional tiger and leopard flyby. You can also swim in the river with Tara, the camp’s memorable 55-year-old elephant, a truly extraordinary experience.

8 Getting There & Away The nearest train station, 56km north in Mandla, is only a narrow gauge station and therefore only reachable by a general seating train from Nainpur (Maharashtra).There are six daily buses from Khatiya Gate to Mandla (₹60, 2½ hours, 2.15am, 6.30am, 8am, 9am, 12.45pm, 5.45pm). The 6.30am, 9am and 12.45pm continue to Jabalpur (₹160, 5½ hours). For Raipur, there’s one daily bus from Mocha (₹210, four hours, 8.30am).
If you catch a bus only as far as Mocha, you can arrange a pick-up with your hotel or you’ll have to hitchhike the remaining 5km to Khatiya.
Services from Mandla bus stand:

Bandhavgarh National Park
%07653
If your sole reason for visiting a national park in India is to see a tiger, look no further. Though it’s not as easy as it used to be, a couple of days at
Bandhavgarh (www.bandhavgarhnationalpark.com; Indian/foreigner per jeep ₹1250/2450, premium zones ₹2450/4850, jeep ₹2000, guide ₹300; h16 Oct-30 Jun, closed Wed evenings) should net you
a tiger sighting in this relatively small park, whose Tala Range boasts the highest density of Royal Bengal tigers in the world (68 as of 2013). Neck and neck with Rajasthan’s Ranthambhore National Park for sightings, it is India’s top tiger playground. There are also more than 40 rarely seen leopards and more commonly sighted animals such as deer, wild boar and langur.
The park is entered at the small, laid-back village of Tala, 32km from Umaria, the nearest train station. Like Kanha, Bandhavgarh has a lot of budget accommodation making this a good place for independent travellers to find others to share safari costs.
The park takes its name from an ancient fort perched on top of 800m-high cliffs. Its ramparts provide a home for vultures, blue rock thrushes and crag martins. You can visit it on special 4WD trips during the day, but you’ll have toa t   s.   ou ca  v s t  t o  spec a    WD t  ps du    g t e day, but you
 
ave to
pay all the usual park entry fees.
A 4WD safari can be booked online (www.mponline.gov.in) up to 120 days in advance, but foreign cards weren’t being accepted at the time of writing. Save yourself immense hassle by allowing hotels/agencies to do this. Ten percent of safari tickets (11 4WDs) are reserved for gate sales and are sold 30 minutes before opening. Lines form as early as midnight the evening prior and it’s a free- for-all, with you against the locals when the gates open (read: you aren’t likely to win). New park formalities have also been implemented to fiscally discourage walk-ups: if you meet other folks with a reservation and extra space in their jeep, you cannot just join them and share the costs. For anyone joining a booked reservation, you will pay an add-on fee, which is the park entrance fee per person (rather than per 4WD). So two foreigners joining a booked group for Tala Gate will pay ₹4850 each to join.
Note that Maghdi (7km from the village) and Khitauli Gates (6km from the village) have cheaper 4WD charges. With safari numbers drastically reduced in the 2012 review, booking early is essential. February to June are the best months for sightings.

8 Getting There & Around A cycle-rickshaw to Umaria’s bus stand from the train station is ₹10 (10 minutes). There are frequent buses to Tala (₹35, 1½ hours, half-hourly 7am to 6pm). To reach Tala outside of those hours, you’ll have to take an autorickshaw (₹500, one hour) or arrange a private taxi in advance (from ₹800).

Pench Tiger Reserve
%07695
The third of Madhya Pradesh’s trio of well-known tiger parks, Pench
(www.penchnationalpark.com; Indian/foreigner ₹1250/2450, jeep ₹200, guide ₹300; h16 Oct-30 Jun,
closed Wed evenings) is made up mostly of teak-tree forest rather than sal and so it has a different flavour from nearby Kanha or Bandhavgarh. It also sees fewer tourists (and fewer tigers – only 33 as of the 2014 census); as you’re driving around the park, you’ll often feel like you have the whole forest to yourself. Turia Gate is the only one of the park’s three gates that is regularly used.
Bookings for 4WD safaris are made online (www.mponline.gov.in) up to 120 days in advance, but foreign cards weren’t being accepted at the time of writing. Allow hotels/agencies to do this and save yourself the hassle. Ten percent of safari tickets (five 4WDs) are reserved for gate sales and are sold 30 minutes before opening – expect lines to form as early as midnight the night before.
Note that if you meet other folks with a reservation and extra space in their 4WD, you cannot just join them and share the costs. For anyone joining a booked reservation, you will pay an add-on fee, which is the park entrance fee per person (rather than per 4WD). Two foreigners joining a booked group will pay ₹2450 each.If you get shut out of a traditional 4WD safari, you can book a spot on the 12-

Indian/foreigner ₹1200/2400) at Kipling’s Court as a last resort. There’s a six-person mimimum.
As at the other tiger parks, there are morning (sunrise to 10.30am) and afternoon (2.30pm to sunset) safaris.
JUNGLE CAT! (EAGLE) JUNGLE CAT! (EAGLE)
Once upon a time in Pench, another journalist and I spotted a jungle cat moments after entering the park. Notoriously shy, he waddled on down the road as we excitedly exclaimed, ‘Jungle cat!’ Our guide was nonplussed, however. ‘Eagle,’ he said. ‘No no,’ we protested. ‘Who cares about an eagle? Jungle cat!’ ‘Eagle,’ he insisted.
Then we got it. A crested hawk-eagle, a fierce bird of prey, was stalking the cat. A Discovery Channel–brutal moment was on the horizon. In a blink, the eagle went into a kamikaze dive, ambushing the cat mercilessly from above. As we pulled up alongside the kill, what we encountered still haunts me to this day. The eagle had a relentless grip on the cat’s neck. Through binoculars, his menacing, otherworldly eyes – full of sheer, unadulterated yellow terror – stared right at us in a motionless trance.
The standoff – the eagle with the cat, us with the eagle – lasted 15 minutes. The eagle’s stare never once strayed from us, as if sending a very serious warning through the most sinister set of eyes I had ever seen in my life. No horror movie could ever do the moment justice.

With an American Southwest desert–style setting, each enormous three-bedroom villa comes with a living room, kitchen, dining room, dip pool and a dedicated cook, waiter and housekeeper.

CHHATTISGARH
Chhattisgarh is remote, its public transport system is poor and its tourist infrastructure outside the main cities is almost nonexistent, but for the intrepid traveller, time spent here may well prove to be the highlight of your trip to this part of India. The country’s most densely forested state is blessed with natural beauty – waterfalls and unspoilt nature reserves abound. More interestingly, though, it’s home to 42 different tribes whose pointillist paintings and spindly sculptures are as vivid as the colourful haats that take place across the region, particularly around Jagdalpur in Bastar.
Chhattisgarh is one of the eastern states associated with the Naxalite guerrillas (an ultra-leftist political movement that began in Naxal Village, West Bengal), but they rarely stray from their remote hideouts on Chhattisgarh’s northern and southern borders.

The capital of the Bastar region is an ideal base for exploring tribal Chhattisgarh. The town itself hosts a haat every Sunday where you’ll see Adivasis (tribal people) buying, selling and bartering alongside town traders, but it’s in the surrounding villages where Adivasi life can be fully appreciated. Some villages are extremely remote, and only really accessible with a guide. Others, though, are just a bus ride away and, particularly on market days, can be explored independently.
Sanjay Market, which hosts the Sunday haat, is the heartbeat of Jagdalpur.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
ANT-EDOTE
Red ants are more than just a painful nuisance to the Bastar tribes. Known as chapura, they also play an important role in food and medicine. They are often eaten live, served on a leaf with white ant eggs. Alternatively, villagers grind them into a paste and mix them with chilli to make chutney. The bodies of chapura contain formic acid believed to haveuseful medicinal qualities. If suffering from a fever, locals will sometimes put their hand into an ants nest, allowing it to be bitten hundreds of times so that the acid is administered into their bloodstream. Patients presumably soon forget their fever.

Barely glimpsed by many travellers scurrying between Mumbai (Bombay) and Rajasthan, Gujarat is an easy side-step off the well-beaten tourist trail. While the capital, Ahmedabad (Amdavad), retains some charm amid its chaos, the countryside holds most of this state’s many treasures. Traditional artisans in tribal villages weave, embroider, dye and print some of India’s finest textiles, and pristine parks harbour unique wildlife, including migratory birds, wild asses and the last remaining prides of Asiatic lions. For the spiritually inclined, sacred Jain and Hindu pilgrimage sites sit atop mountains that rise dramatically from vast flatlands. And colourful festivals burst with a cornucopia of culture.
Gujarat also claims a special relationship to the life and work of Mahatma Gandhi: he was born here, he ignited the satyagraha movement from here, he made his Salt March here – and his legacy remains a vibrant part of public discourse and private lives.

History
It’s said that Gujarat’s Temple of Somnath witnessed the creation of the universe; sometime later, the state became Krishna’s stomping ground. On a firmer historical footing, Lothal and Dholavira (Kachchh) were important sites of the Indus Valley civilisation more than 4000 years ago. Gujarat featured in the exploits of the mighty Buddhist emperor Ashoka, and Jainism first took root under a grandson of Ashoka who governed Saurashtra.
The rule of the Hindu Solanki dynasty from the 10th to 13th centuries, with its capital at Patan, is considered Gujarat’s cultural golden age. Solanki rule was ended when Ala-ud-din Khilji brought Gujarat into the Delhi sultanate after several campaigns around 1300. A century later the Muslim Gujarat sultanate broke free of Delhi rule and established a new capital at Ahmedabad. The Mughal empire conquered Gujarat in the 1570s and held it until the Hindu Marathas from central India occupied eastern and central Gujarat in the 18th century. The British set up their first Indian trading base at Surat on Gujarat’s coast in about 1614, and replaced Maratha power in the early 19th century.
It’s from Gujarat that Gandhi launched his program of nonviolent resistance against British rule, beginning with protests and fasting, and culminating with the 390km Salt March, which drew the attention of the world and galvanised anti-British sentiment across India. After Independence, eastern Gujarat became part of Bombay state. Saurashtra and Kachchh, initially separate states, were incorporated into Bombay state in 1956. In 1960 Bombay state was divided on linguistic lines into Gujarati-speaking Gujarat and Marathi-speaking Maharashtra.
The Congress Party of India largely controlled Gujarat until 1991 when theBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. In 2002, communal violence erupted after a Muslim mob was blamed for an arson attack on a train at Godhra that killed 59 Hindu activists. Hindu gangs set upon Muslims in revenge. In three days, an estimated 2000 people were killed (official figures are lower) – most of them Muslims – and tens of thousands were left homeless. The BJP-led state government was widely accused of tacitly, and sometimes actively, supporting some of worst attacks on Muslim neighbourhoods for political gain; later that year Gujarat’s then chief minister, Nahendra Modi, won a landslide re- election victory. A decade later, in 2012, a former BJP minister was convicted of criminal conspiracy and murder in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the Godhra riots, but Modi has so far been cleared of all charges related to the violence. Since the 2002 riots, Gujarat has been peaceful, and enjoys a reputation as one of India’s most prosperous and businesslike states. And Modi, of course, became India’s prime minister in 2014.

Ahmedabad (also called Amdavad, Ahmadabad or Ahemdavad) is Gujarat’s major city and a startling metropolis with a long history, many remarkable buildings  a fascinating maze of an old quarter excellent museums  finebuildings, a fascinating maze of an old quarter, excellent museums, fine restaurants and fabulous night markets. Yet the old-world charm is all but swamped by 21st-century traffic, crowding, pollution and the usual extremes of wealth and poverty. Many travellers stop off briefly en route to Rajasthan or Mumbai, sneaking in a visit to Sabarmati Ashram (Gandhi’s former headquarters). You need a little stamina to get to know the city better, as it’s quite spread out and moving around can be a bit of a task.
The old city lies on the east side of the Sabarmati River and used to be surrounded by a 10km-long wall, of which little now remains except 15 formidable gates standing as forlorn islands amid swirling, cacophonous traffic. The new city on the west side of the river, nearly all built in the last 50 years, has wider streets, several major universities and many middle-class neighbourhoods.
History
Ahmedabad was founded in 1411 by Gujarati sultan Ahmed Shah at the spot where, legend tells, he saw a hare chasing a dog and was impressed by its bravery. The city quickly spread beyond his citadel on the east bank of the Sabarmati, and by the 17th century it was considered one of the finest cities in India, a prospering trade nexus adorned with an array of fine Islamic architecture. Its influence waned, but from the second half of the 19th century Ahmedabad rose again as a huge textile centre (the ‘Manchester of the East’). By the late 20th century many of the mills had closed and the subsequent economic hardship may have been a contributing factor in the communal violence that split the city in 2002, when about 2000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Today Ahmedabad is booming again as a centre for IT, education and chemical production on top of its traditional textiles and commerce, and has been officially dubbed a ‘megacity’.Ahmedabad (Amdavad)

In peaceful, shady grounds on the Sabarmati River’s west bank, this ashram was Gandhi’s headquarters from 1917 to 1930 during the long struggle for Indian independence. It’s said he chose this site because it lay between a jail and a cemetery, and any satyagrahi (nonviolent resister) was bound to end up in one or the other. Gandhi’s poignant, spartan living quarters are preserved, and there’s a museum that presents a moving and informative record of his life and teachings.
It was from here, on 12 March 1930, that Gandhi and 78 companions set out on the famous Salt March to Dandi, on the Gulf of Cambay, in a symbolic protest, with Gandhi vowing not to return to the ashram until India had gained independence. The ashram was disbanded in 1933, later becoming a centre for Dalit welfare activities and cottage industries. After Gandhi’s death some of his ashes were immersed in the river in front of the ashram.It’s about 5km north of Lal Darwaja; bus 83 (₹11) runs here from Lal Darwaja bus stand.

MOSQUES & MAUSOLEUMSMOSQUES & MAUSOLEUMS
Under the Gujarat sultanate in the 15th and 16th centuries, and especially under Ahmed Shah I (1411–42) and Mahmud Begada (1459–1511), Ahmedabad was endowed with a remarkable collection of stone mosques in a unique style incorporating elements of Hindu and Jain design. Note that women are not allowed into the actual prayer halls and at some mosques are restricted to the periphery.

Built by Ahmed Shah in 1423, the Jama Masjid ranks as one of India’s most beautiful mosques, enhanced by an enormous, peaceful courtyard. Demolished Hindu and Jain temples provided the building materials, and the mosque displays some architectural fusion with these religions, notably in the lotus-like carving of some domes, which are supported by the prayer hall’s 260 columns. There were once two ‘shaking’ minarets, but they lost half their height in the great earthquake of 1819; their lower portions still flank the prayer hall’s central portico.

Navratri
(Festival of Nine Nights; hSep/Oct)
DANCE
Navratri is celebrated India-wide, but Gujarat has made it its own. This nine-night festival celebrates the feminine divinity in the forms of the goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati – particularly Durga’s slaying of the demon Mahishasura. Celebrations centre on special shrines at junctions, marketplaces and, increasingly, large venues that can accommodate thousands.
People dress up in sparkling finery to whirl the night away in entrancing garba or dandiya rasa circle dances till the early hours. Celebrated in every town and village in Gujarat, Navratri is a festival where you may well find yourself joining in.
The night after Navratri is Dussehra, which celebrates the victory of Rama over Ravana, with more nocturnal dancing and fireworks, plus the burning of giant effigies of the defeated demon king.

There are plans to issue permits over the internet in the near future. The permit allows you two units over the month, which equates to 20 bottles of standard beer or two 750mL bottles of liquor, which you must drink in private. Cheers!

8 Getting Around The airport is 8km north of the centre; a prepaid taxi should cost around ₹550, depending on your destination. An autorickshaw costs about ₹170 to the old city.
Autorickshaw drivers are supposed to turn their meter to zero at the start of a trip then calculate the fare using a conversion chart at the end. Some meters have been rigged, but most work properly. If a driver refuses to use the meter, negotiate the fare in advance.ADVANCE BUS RESERVATIONS
These days, it’s becoming much more common for passengers using public intercity buses run by Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC, ST) to reserve seats in advance. Theoretically, you should be able do this online by registering at www.gsrtc.in. None of our attempts to book tickets by computer were successful, but we had no problem connecting to their internet system via smartphone – using an Indian SIM card with a data plan. (The system is also very useful for checking most bus route timings.) Alternatively, if you don’t have the technology, many bus stands have online reservation windows, where you can make advance bookings in person. Doing so is not absolutely necessary, but depending on the route, you just might get stuck standing for a few hours.

Adalaj Vav
Adalaj Vav
(hdawn-dusk)
NOTABLE BUILDING
The Adalaj Vav, 19km north of Ahmedabad, is among the finest of the Gujarati step-wells. Built by Queen Rudabai in 1499, it has three entrances leading to a huge platform that rests on 16 pillars, with corners marked by shrines. The octagonal well is five storeys deep and is decorated with exquisite stone carvings; subjects range from eroticism to buttermilk.
From Ahmedabad, an autorickshaw costs ₹450 return, or take bus 85 from Lal Darwaja to Chandkheda, transfer to bus 501 towards Sarkej, and ask the driver to let you off at the Adalaj Vav turn-off, from where you can walk or take an autorickshaw about 1km.
Gandhinagar
With broad avenues and greenery, Gandhinagar forms a striking contrast to Ahmedabad. This is where state politicians live in large, fortified houses. Although Ahmedabad became Gujarat’s capital when the old state of Bombay was split, this new capital was planned 28km north on the west bank of the

Gandhinagar’s only real tourist attraction is the spectacular Akshardham
(www.akshardham.com; J Rd, Sector 20; h9.30am-6.30pm Tue-Sun), belonging to the wealthy
Hindu Swaminarayan group. Ornately carved and built by nearly 1000 artisans, the temple is constructed of 6000 tonnes of pink sandstone and surrounded by manicured gardens. Elaborate underground exhibition areas (admission ₹170; h10am-5.30pm Tue-Sun) feature high- (and low-) tech multimedia displays on the Swaminarayan movement and the Hindu epics. At sunset every day, except Monday, a 45-minute Water Show (adult/child ₹75/50) presents the story of the Upanishads through fountains, music, fire and lasers. It promises to reveal the secret of life after death. There’s also a small amusement park for kids. Note that cameras, mobile phones and bags are not allowed into the compound.
Buses from Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar (₹20, 45 minutes, every 15 to 30 minutes) depart from the back northwest corner of Lal Darwaja, from the ST bus stand and from numerous stops along Ashram Rd. From the Gandhinagar bus stand to Akshardham, take an autorickshaw for ₹50.
Nalsarovar Bird Sanctuary
Nalsarovar Bird Sanctuary
(Indian/foreigner ₹20/300, car ₹20, camera/video ₹100/2500; h6am-6pm)
WILDLIFE RESERVE
This 121-sq-km sanctuary, 60km southwest of Ahmedabad, protects Nalsarovar Lake, a flood of island-dotted blue dissolving into the sky and iron-flat plains, and its surrounding wetlands. Between November and February, the sanctuary sees flocks of indigenous and migratory birds, with as many as 250 species passing through. Ducks, geese, eagles, spoonbills, cranes, pelicans and flamingos are best seen at daybreak and dusk.
The sanctuary is busiest at weekends and on holidays. To see the birds it’s best to hire a boat (around ₹150, negotiable, per hour). Gujarat Tourism offers luxury tent (%9427725090; s/d ₹1100/1650; a) accommodation 1.5km from the lake. A taxi from Ahmedabad costs around ₹4400 for a day trip, and gives you the option of combining Nalsarovar with Lothal (40km south).Lothal
About 80km southwest of Ahmedabad, the city that stood at this archaeological site (hdawn-dusk) 4500 years ago was one of the most important of the Indus Valley civilisation, which extended into what is now Pakistan. Excavations have revealed the world’s oldest known artificial dock, which was connected to an old course of the Sabarmati River. Artefacts suggest that trade may have been conducted with Mesopotamia, Egypt and Persia. The site museum displays intricate seals, weights and measures, games and jewellery, plus an artist’s impression of how Lothal looked at its peak. Lacking dramatic buildings, the site is best appreciated by true archaeology buffs.
Palace Utelia (%9825012611; www.thepalaceutelia.com; r from ₹6000; a), a heritage
hotel 7km from the site, by the Bhugavo River, is an imposing palace – complete with aged retainers – that dwarfs the village it oversees. The shabby rooms are overpriced, but it’s an unusual place with some charm if not comfort.
Lothal is a long day trip from Ahmedabad, and a taxi (around ₹4400 return) is the easiest bet. Trains from Ahmedabad’s Gandhigram station depart at 7.15am and 9am to Lothal-Bhurkhi station (2nd-class ₹45, two hours), 6km from the site, from where you can catch a bus. Take water and food with you.

VAUTHA FAIR
Vautha Fair
(hNov)
FAIR
Each year, Gujarat’s largest livestock fair is held at Vautha, at the confluence of the Sabarmati and Vatrak Rivers, 50km south of Ahmedabad. Thousands of donkeys, camels and cows change hands here, and some 25,000 people – including many maldhari (herder) pastoralists – set up tents and stay for a few days of buying, selling, eating, dancing, and making sunset puja (prayers) in the river. Check with Gujarat Tourism for exact dates.
ModheraBuilt in 1026 and 1027 by King Bhimdev I, the Sun Temple (Indian/foreigner
₹5/100; h9am-5pm) in Modhera is one of the greatest monuments of the Solanki dynasty, whose rulers were believed to be descended from the sun. The exterior is intricately carved with demons and deities, and the main hall and shrine are reached through a pillared pavilion. Inside, 52 sculpted pillars depict scenes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, and a hall with 12 niches represents the different monthly manifestations of Surya (the sun god). Erotic sculpture panels complete the sensual decoration.
Like the better-known Sun Temple at Konark in Odisha (Orissa), which it predates by 200 years, the Modhera temple was designed so that the dawn sun shone on the image of Surya during the equinox. Surya Kund, an extraordinary rectangular step-well inside the complex, contains over 100 shrines, resembling a sunken art gallery.
Each year the temple is the scene for a three-day classical dance festival (haround 20 Jan) with dancers from all over India.
Modhera is 100km northwest of Ahmedabad. You can take a bus (₹65, two hours, half-hourly) from Ahmedabad’s ST bus stand to Mahesana (Mehsana), and then another bus 26km west to Modhera (₹30, one hour). There are also trains from Ahmedabad to Mahesana. A taxi from Ahmedabad is much easier, and will cost about ₹3500 round trip, including a visit to nearby Patan.
Patan
%02766 / Pop 125,502
About 130km northwest of Ahmedabad, Patan was Gujarat’s capital for six centuries before Ahmedabad was founded in 1411. It was ruined by the armies of Ala-ud-din Khilji around 1300, and today is a dusty, little town with narrow streets lined by elaborate wooden houses.
Patan is famed, far and wide, for its beautiful Patola silk textiles, produced by the torturously laborious double-ikat method. Both the warp (lengthways) and weft (transverse) threads are painstakingly tie-dyed to create the pattern before the weaving process begins. It takes about six months to make one sari, which might cost ₹100,000.1 Sights
Rani-ki-Vav

HISTORIC SITE
The only real sign of Patan’s former glory is this astoundingly beautiful step- well. Built in 1063 by Rani Udayamati to commemorate her husband, Bhimdev I, the step-well is the oldest and finest in Gujarat and is remarkably preserved. Steps lead down through multiple levels with lines of carved pillars and over 800 sculptures, mostly on Vishnu-avatar themes.

Vadodara (Baroda)
%0265 / Pop 1.66 million
Vadodara (or Baroda as it’s often known) lies 106km southeast of Ahmedabad, a little over an hour’s drive along National Expressway 1. Vadodara has some interesting city sights, but the main reason for coming here is the stunning Unesco World Heritage Site of Champaner and Pavagadh nearby. The city is way less hectic than Ahmedabad, and parts of the Sayajigunj area near the university have a college-town feel.
After the Marathas expelled the Mughals from Gujarat in the 18th century, their local lieutenants, the Gaekwad clan, made Vadodara their capital. Vadodara retained a high degree of autonomy even under the British, right up to Independence in 1947. Maharaja Sayajirao III (1875–1939) was a great moderniser and laid the foundations of Vadodara’s modern reputation as Gujarat’s cultural capital.Vadodara (Baroda)

Around Vadodara
Champaner & Pavagadh
This spectacular Unesco World Heritage Site, 47km northeast of Vadodara, combines a sacred, 762m volcanic hill (Pavagadh) that rises dramatically from the plains and a ruined Gujarati capital with beautiful mosque architecture (Champaner). The whole area is referred to as Pavagadh.
1 Sights
Pavagadh
HISTORIC SITE
 
This strategic hilltop may have been fortified as early as the 8th century. It became the capital of the Chauhan Rajputs around 1300, but in 1484 was taken by the Gujarat sultan Mahmud Begada, after a 20-month siege; the Rajputs committed jauhar (ritual mass suicide) in the face of defeat. Today, throngs of pilgrims ascend Pavagadh to worship at the important Kalikamata Temple , dedicated to the evil-destroying goddess Kali, who sits atop the summit.
Near the top of the hill you will also find Pavagadh’s oldest surviving monument, the 10th-to 11th-century Hindu Lakulisha Temple, and several Jain temples. The views are fantastic and so are, if you’re lucky, the cooling breezes. During the nine days of Navratri and the Mahakali Festival, the usual flow of pilgrims becomes a flood.
To ascend Pavagadh, you can either walk up the pilgrim trail, which will take two to three hours, or you can take a shuttle (₹20) from along the Champaner Citadel south wall. The shuttle deposits you about halfway up the hill, where you can either join the walking path (here lined by souvenir and drink stalls), or hop on the ropeway (cable car; return ₹98; h6am-6.45pm) which glides you up to within a 700m walk of the Kalikamata Temple.Champaner
HISTORIC SITE
(Indian/foreigner ₹10/250; h8am-6pm)
Following his capture of Pavagadh, Sultan Mahmud Begada turned Champaner, at the base of the hill, into a splendid new capital. But its glory was brief: when it was captured by Mughal emperor Humayun in 1535, the Gujarati capital reverted to Ahmedabad, and Champaner fell into ruin. The heart of this historic site is the Citadel, whose most impressive features are its monumental mosques (no longer used for worship), with their beautiful blending of Islamic and Hindu decoration styles.
The huge Jami Masjid , just outside the Citadel’s east gate, boasts a wonderful carved entrance porch that leads into a lovely courtyard surrounded by a pillared corridor. The prayer hall has two tall central minarets, further superb stone carving, multiple domes, and seven mihrabs (prayer niches) along the back wall.
Other beautiful mosques include the Saher ki Masjid , behind the ticket office inside the Citadel, which was probably the private royal mosque, and the Kevda Masjid , 300m north of the Citadel and about 600m west of the Jami Masjid. Here you can climb narrow stairs to the roof, and higher up the minarets, to spot other mosques even further out into the countryside – Nagina Masjid , 500m north, with no minarets but exquisite geometric carving, and Lila Gumbaj ki Masjid , 800m east, on a high platform and with a fluted central dome. The twin minarets resembling factory chimneys, about 1km west, adorn the Brick Minar ki Masjid , a rare brick tomb.
8 Getting There & Away Buses to Pavagadh run about every half- hour from Vadodara (₹41, 1½ hours); a return taxi costs around
₹1000. Some buses from Pavagadh travel via Vadodara to Ahmedabad (₹80, four hours).
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
SOUTH OF VADODARAGujarat stretches some 240km south from Vadodara to the border of Maharashtra, 150km short of Mumbai. Surat , 140km south of Vadodara, is where the British established their first Indian settlement in 1614. It’s now Gujarat’s hectic second-biggest city (population five million), and a busy commercial centre for textiles and diamonds. Around 40km south of Surat is Dandi , the destination of Gandhi’s epic Salt March in 1930, with several Gandhi monuments by its strikingly empty beach. Just before the Maharashtra border is the ex-Portuguese enclave of Daman , an alcohol-infused resort town on a grey sea. Though it still retains a little of the piquancy of old Portugal, Daman is far less attractive than its counterpart, Diu in Saurashtra. In the southeast, the hilly Dangs district is the northern extremity of the Western Ghats, with a large tribal population and little tourist infrastructure. The main town is the minor hill resort of Saputara. The Dangs Darbar (hFeb/Mar), in the week before Holi, is a spectacular, largely tourist-free tribal festival.
SAURASHTRA
Before Independence, Saurashtra, also known as the Kathiawar Peninsula, was a jumble of over 200 princely states. Today it has a number of hectic industrial cities, but most of them retain a core of narrow old streets crowded with small- scale commerce. Outside the cities it’s still villages, fields, forests and a timeless, almost feudal feel, with farmers and maldhari (herders) dressed head to toe in white, and rural women as colourful as their neighbours in Rajasthan.
Saurashtra is mainly flat and its rare hills are often sacred, including the spectacular, temple-topped Shatrunjaya and Girnar. The peninsula is liberally endowed with wildlife sanctuaries, notably Sasan Gir, where Asia’s last wild lions roam. On the south coast lies the very quaint, laid-back ex-Portuguese island enclave of Diu. Saurashtra is also where Mahatma Gandhi was born and raised: you can visit several sites associated with his life.
Saurashtra has a reputation for being fond of its sleep, and siesta takes place from at least 1pm to 3pm.
GUJARATI CUISINE
Gujarat is strong on vegetarian cuisine, partly thanks to the Jain influence here, and the quintessential Gujarati meal is the all-veg thali. It’s sweeter, lighter and less spicy and oily than Punjabi thali and locals – who are famously particular about food – have no doubt it’s the best thali in the world. It begins with a large stainless-steel dish, onto which teamsof waiters will serve most or all of the following: curries, chutneys, pickles, dhal, kadhi (a yoghurt and gram-flour preparation), raita, rotis, rice, khichdi (a blend of lightly spiced rice and lentils), farsan (savoury nibbles), salad and one or two sweet items – to be eaten concurrently with the rest. Buttermilk is the traditional accompanying drink. Normally the rice and/or khichdi don’t come till you’ve finished with the rotis. In most thali restaurants the waiters will keep coming back until you can only say ‘No more’.

This beautiful 34-sq-km park encompasses large areas of pale, custard-coloured grassland stretching between two seasonal rivers. Formerly called Velavadar National Park, it’s famous for its blackbucks, beautiful, fast antelope that sport elegant spiralling horns – as long as 65cm in mature males. Some 1600 inhabit the park  which is also good for spotting birds such as wintering harriers fromthe park, which is also good for spotting birds such as wintering harriers from Siberia (about 2000 of them most years). If you’re lucky, you may even spot wolves.

Palitana
%02848 / Pop 55,000
The hustling, dusty town of Palitana, 51km southwest of Bhavnagar, has grown rapidly to serve the pilgrim trade around Shatrunjaya. Your best bet for general information is the helpful manager at Hotel Shravak.
1 Sights & Activities
o Shatrunjaya
(Place of Victory; htemples 6.30am-6pm)
SACRED SITE
One of Jainism’s holiest pilgrimage sites, Shatrunjaya is an incredible hilltop seaof temples, built over 900 years. It is said that Adinath (also known as
Rishabha), the founder of Jainism, meditated and gave his first sermon beneath the rayan tree at the summit. The temples are grouped into tunks (enclosures), each with a central temple and many minor ones. The 500m climb up 3300 steps to the temples adds to the extraordinary experience.
The steps start on the southwest edge of Palitana about 3.5km from the bus stand (₹20 by autorickshaw). Most days, hundreds of pilgrims make the 1½- hour climb; crowds swell into the thousands around Kartik Purnima, which marks the end of Chaturmas, a four-month period of spiritual retreat and material self-denial that coincides with the monsoon season.
As you near the top of the hill, the track forks. The main entrance, Ram Pole, is reached by bearing left, though the best views are to the right, where on a clear day you can see the Gulf of Cambay. Inside the Nav Tonk Gate, one path leads left to the Muslim shrine of Angar Pir – a Muslim saint who protected the temples from a Mughal attack; women who want children come here and make offerings of miniature cradles. To the right, the second tunk you reach is the Chaumukhji Tunk, containing the Chaumukh (Four-Faced Shrine), built in 1618 by a wealthy Jain merchant. Images of Adinath, the first tirthankar (great Jain teacher; believed to have attained enlightenment here), face the four cardinal directions.
You can easily spend a couple of hours wandering among the hundreds of temples up here. The biggest and one of the most splendid and important, with a fantastic wealth of detailed carving, is the Adinath Temple , on the highest point on the far (south) side.
Shri Vishal Jain Museum
MUSEUM
(admission ₹10; h8.30am-12.30 & 3.30-8.30pm)
This museum features some remarkable – if randomly displayed – exhibits of Jain artwork and artefacts up to 500 years old. In the basement is a surprising circular temple with mirror walls and centuries-old images of four tirthankars. It’s 500m down the street from the foot of the Shatrunjaya steps.
SHATRUNJAYA PRACTICALITIESIt’s best to start the ascent around dawn, before it gets too hot. Dress respectfully (no shorts etc), leave behind leather items (including belts and bags), and don’t eat or drink inside the temples. If you wish, you can be carried up and down the hill in a dholi (portable chair with two bearers), for about ₹1000 round trip. Photos may be taken on the trail and outside the temples, but not inside them.
4 Sleeping & Eating
Hotel Shravak
(%252428; s/d/tr ₹200/500/600, r with AC ₹900; a)
HOTEL
The ultrabasic rooms at the friendly and helpful Shravak, opposite the bus stand, are the best bet in Palitana itself. They’re shabby but clean, though bathrooms are hit or miss (mostly miss); doubles are much bigger than singles. Buckets of hot water are available from 5am to 10am.
o Vijay Vilas Palace
HERITAGE HOTEL
(%282371, 9427182809; vishwa_adpur@yahoo.co.in; Adpur village; r incl breakfast ₹3750; a)
This small former palace built in 1906 sits surrounded by fields in the countryside beneath the western end of Shatrunjaya, 10km west of Palitana. There are six large, plain but nicely decorated rooms, with original furniture. Three have terraces/balconies looking towards Shatrunjaya – which can be climbed from here by a slightly shorter, steeper path than the one from Palitana.
Vijay Vilas is family-run, with delicious home-cooked food (a mix of Gujarati and Rajasthani, veg and nonveg). You can also just pop in for lunch (₹300) – it’s best to call first.
Jagruti Restaurant
(thali ₹35-70; h24hr)
INDIAN
Across the laneway from Hotel Shravak, Jagruti is a wildly busy thali house.
8 Getting There & Away Plenty of ST buses run to/from Bhavnagar (₹37, 1½ hours, hourly) and Ahmedabad (₹150, five hours, hourly). For Diu, take a bus to Talaja (₹21, one hour, hourly),where you can change for Diu (₹90, 5½ hours, around six daily).
Four passenger trains run daily to/from Bhavnagar (2nd class ₹15, 1½ hours).
Diu
%02875 / Pop 52,056
Diu is different. This tiny island linked by a bridge to Gujarat’s southern coast is infused with Portuguese history; its major architectural landmarks include three churches and a seafront fort; the streets of the main town are remarkably clean and quiet once you get off the tourist-packed waterfront strip; and alcohol is legal here. If you’ve been spending time immersed in the intensity of Gujarati cities, or just really need a beer, Diu offers a refreshing break.
Despite its draw as a seaside destination, Diu is not a great choice for a beach- centric vacation. Most of its sandy strips are littered with trash, and the throngs of families make them better for people-watching than sun-worshipping. Add in the random drunk-guy factor and any fantasies you have of a tropical paradise will surely be dashed. Diu, however, is one of the safest places in India to ride a scooter, with minimum traffic and excellent roads, and zipping along the coast with the wind in your hair is a joy.
Like Daman and Goa, Diu was a Portuguese colony until taken over by India in 1961. With Daman, it is still governed from Delhi as part of the Union Territory of Daman & Diu and is not part of Gujarat. It includes Diu Island, about 11km by 3km, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel, and two tiny mainland enclaves. One of these, housing the village of Ghoghla, is the entry point to Diu from Una.
Diu town sits at the east end of the island. The northern side of the island, facing Gujarat, is tidal marsh and salt pans, while the southern coast alternates between limestone cliffs, rocky coves and sandy beaches.
The island’s main industries are fishing, tourism, alcohol and salt. Kalpana Distillery at Malala produces rum from sugar cane.
One custom of the Portuguese still very much respected by local businesses is that of the siesta, meaning you shouldn’t count on much being open in the mid- afternoon.History Diu was the first landing point for the Parsis when they fled from Persia in the 7th century AD, and it became a major port between the 14th and 16th centuries, when it was the trading post and naval base from which the Ottomans controlled the northern Arabian Sea shipping routes.
The Portuguese secured control of Diu in 1535 and kept it until India launched Operation Vijay in 1961. After the Indian Air Force unnecessarily bombed the airstrip and terminal near Nagoa Beach, it remained derelict until the late 1980s. Diu, Daman and Goa were administered as one union territory of India until 1987, when Goa became a state.
8 Dangers & Annoyances More an annoyance than a danger, drunk male can be tiresome, particularly for women, and particularly around Nagoa Beach. Also, beware of broken glass in the sand.Diu Town

Diu Town
The town is sandwiched between the massive fort at its east end and a huge city
wall on the west. The main Zampa Gateway (

 ), painted
bright red, has carvings of lions, angels and a priest, while just inside it is a chapel with an image of the Virgin and Child dating from 1702.
Cavernous St Paul’s Church ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h8am-6pm) is a
wedding cake of a church, founded by Jesuits in 1600 and then rebuilt in 1807. Its neoclassical facade is the most elaborate of any Portuguese church in India. Inside, it’s a great barn, with a small cloister next door, above which is a school. Daily mass is heard here. Nearby is white-walled St Thomas’ Church ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ), a lovely, simple building that is now the Diu Museum ( 
 ; h9am-9pm), with a spooky, evocative collection of wooden
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
Catholic saints going back to the 16th century. Once a year, on All Saints Day (1November), this is used for a packed-out mass. The Portuguese-descended population mostly live in this area, still called Farangiwada (Foreigners’
Quarter). The Church of St Francis of Assisi (Hospital; 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ),
founded in 1593, has been converted into a hospital, but is also sometimes used for services.
Many other Diu buildings show a lingering Portuguese influence. The western part of town is a maze of narrow, winding streets and many houses are brightly painted, with the most impressive being in the Panchwati area, notably Nagar
Sheth Haveli ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), an old merchant’s house laden with
stucco scrolls and fulsome fruit.
Around the Island
o Diu Fort
FORT
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h8am-6pm)
Built in 1535, with additions made in 1541, this massive, well-preserved Portuguese fort with its double moat (one tidal) must once have been impregnable, but sea erosion and neglect are leading to a slow collapse. Cannonballs litter the place, and the ramparts have a superb array of cannons. The lighthouse, which you can climb, is Diu’s highest point, with a beam that reaches 32km. There are several small chapels, one holding engraved tombstone fragments.
Part of the fort also serves as the island’s jail.
Gangeswar Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
 
Gangeswar Temple, on the south coast 3km west of town, just past Fudam village, is a small coastal cave where five Shiva linga (phallic symbols) are washed by the waves.
Sea Shell Museum
(adult/child ₹20/10; h9.30am-5pm)
MUSEUM
This museum, 6km from town on the Nagoa road, is a labour of love. CaptainDevjibhai Vira Fulbaria, a merchant navy captain, collected thousands of shells from literally all over the world in 50 years of sailing, and has displayed and labelled them in English with great care.
Parsi Bungali
HISTORIC SITE
 
A stone-paved path leads 200m inland from Gangeswar Temple to two Parsi ‘towers of silence’ – squat, round stone towers where the Parsis laid their dead out to be consumed by vultures. Climb the ramp slowly and make some noise, so as not to startle the groups of dogs that hang out inside.
o Vanakbara
VILLAGE
 
At the extreme west of the island, Vanakbara is a fascinating little fishing village and the highlight of Diu. It’s great to wander around the port, packed with colourful fishing boats and bustling activity – best around 7am to 8am when the fishing fleet returns and sells off its catch.
Beaches
Nagoa Beach , on the south coast of the island 7km west of Diu town, is long, palm-fringed and safe for swimming – but trash-strewn and very busy, often with drunk men: foreign women receive a lot of unwanted attention. Two kilometres further west begins the sandy, 2.5km sweep of Gomptimata Beach
. This is often empty, except on busy weekends, but it gets big waves – you need to be a strong swimmer here. Within walking distance of Diu town is the rocky
Jallandhar Beach ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), on the town’s southern shore; the
longer, sandier Chakratirth Beach ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), west of Jallandhar; and
pretty Sunset Point Beach , a small, gentle curve beyond Chakratirth that’s popular for swimming and relatively hassle-free. Sunset Point itself is a small headland at the south end of the beach, topped by the INS Khukhri Memorial , commemorating an Indian Navy frigate sunk off Diu during the 1971 India– Pakistan War. Unfortunately the region around Sunset Point is also a dumping ground, and any early-morning excursion will reveal that the tidal zone here is apopular toilet venue.
The best beach is Ghoghla Beach , north of Diu. A long stretch of sand, it’s got less trash and fewer people than the others, along with gentle waves and some decent restaurants behind it.

There’s also good coffee, cold beer, groovy music and friendly service.

Local buses from Diu town to Nagoa and Vanakbara (both ₹10) leave Jethibai bus stand at 7am, 11am and 4pm. From Nagoa, they depart for Diu town from near the police post at 1pm, 5.30pm and 7pm.
Veraval
%02876 / Pop 153,696
Cluttered and chaotic, Veraval is one of India’s major fishing ports; its busy harbour is full of bustle and boat building. It was also the major seaport for Mecca pilgrims before the rise of Surat. The main reason to come here now is to visit the Temple of Somnath, 6km southeast; while the town of Somnath is a nicer place to stay, Veraval is more convenient to public transport.1 Sights
Bhalka Tirth
HINDU TEMPLE
 
One kilometre from Veraval towards Somnath, Bhalka Tirth is where Krishna was mistaken for a deer (he was sleeping in a deerskin) and fatally wounded by an arrow. The temple here is an architecturally mundane affair, but it contains an image of Krishna reclining, a tulsi tree planted in his memory growing out through the roof, a relief of his footprint and two Shiva linga.
A sign outside tells us that this was where Krishna departed on his journey to Neejdham (final rest) at 2.27 and 30 seconds am on 18 February, 3102 BC.

About 2km from downtown Veraval towards Somnath, the harbour is a striking sight with hundreds of wooden dhows flying colourful flags.

Somnath
%02876
Somnath’s famous, phoenix-like temple stands in neat gardens above the beach, 6km southeast of Veraval. The sea below gives it a wistful charm. The small town of Somnath is an agglomeration of narrow, interesting market streets with no car traffic, so it’s easy to walk around and enjoy. There’s a State Bank ATM on your right as you approach the temple. Somnath celebrates Kartik Purnima, marking Shiva’s killing of the demon Tripurasura, with a large colourful fair.
1 Sights
Temple of Somnath
(h6am-9pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
It’s said that Somraj (the moon god) first built a temple here, made of gold; this was rebuilt by Ravana in silver, by Krishna in wood and by Bhimdev in stone. The current serene, symmetrical structure was built to traditional designs on the original coastal site: it’s painted a creamy colour and boasts a little fine sculpture. The large, black Shiva lingam at its heart is one of the 12 most sacred Shiva shrines, known as jyoti linga.
A description of the temple by Al-Biruni, an Arab traveller, was so glowing that it prompted a visit in 1024 by a most unwelcome tourist – the legendary looter Mahmud of Ghazni from Afghanistan. At that time, the temple was so wealthy that it had 300 musicians, 500 dancing girls and even 300 barbers. Mahmud of Ghazni took the town and temple after a two-day battle in which it’s said 70,000 Hindu defenders died. Having stripped the temple of its fabulouswealth, Mahmud destroyed it. So began a pattern of Muslim destruction and Hindu rebuilding that continued for centuries. The temple was again razed in 1297, 1394 and finally in 1706 by Aurangzeb, the notorious Mughal ruler. After that, the temple wasn’t rebuilt until 1950.
Cameras, mobile phones and bags must be left at the cloakroom before entering. Colourful dioramas of the Shiva story line the north side of the temple garden, though it’s hard to see them through the hazy glass. A one-hour sound- and-light show highlights the temple nightly at 7.45pm.

Shyam Travels (%232670), just north of the ST bus stand, also runs several evening buses to Ahmedabad (seat/sleeper ₹350/450, nine hours), with one AC departure (₹500) at 9.45pm; it also serves other destinations including Bhuj and Dwarka.
Gir National Park & Wildlife Sanctuary
%02877
The last refuge of the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) is this forested, hilly, 1412-sq-km sanctuary about halfway between Veraval and Junagadh. It feels beguilingly uncommercial, and simply driving through the thick, undisturbed forests would be a joy even if there wasn’t the excitement of lions and other wildlife to spot.
The sanctuary was set up in 1965, and a 259-sq-km core area was declared a national park in 1975. Since the late 1960s, lion numbers have increased from under 200 to over 400. The sanctuary’s 37 other mammal species, most of which have also increased in numbers, include dainty chital (spotted deer), sambar (large deer), nilgais (large antelopes), chousinghas (four-horned antelopes), chinkaras (gazelles), crocodiles and rarely seen leopards. Sasan Gir is a great destination for birders too, with over 300 species, most of them resident.
While the wildlife has been lucky, more than half of the sanctuary’s human community of distinctively dressed maldhari (herders) have been resettled elsewhere, ostensibly because their cattle and buffalo were competing for food resources with the antelopes, deer and gazelles, while also being preyed upon by the lions and leopards. Around 1000 people still live in the park, however, and their livestock accounts for about a quarter of the lions’ diet.
Gir is no longer big enough for the number of lions that currently live here; some may be moved to Madhya Pradesh to protect genetic diversity, but the Gujarat government opposes this plan, vying to remain the sole home of India’s lions.
The sanctuary access point is Sasan Gir village, on a minor road and railway between Veraval and Junagadh (about 40km from each). The best time to visit is

1 Safaris Safaris (www.girlion.in; permit vehicle with up to 6 passengers Indian/foreigner ₹400/US$40 Mon-Fri, ₹500/US$50 Sat & Sun, guide 3hr ₹250, camera Indian/foreigner ₹100/600) into the sanctuary are made in 4WDs – called Gypsies – and entry is strictly managed. Visiting hours are split into three, three-hour time slots – 6am to 9am, 9am to noon, and 3pm to 6pm – and only 30 Gypsies are allowed in the park at any one time. Your best bet for seeing wildlife is early morning or a bit before sunset.
Most hotels and guesthouses in and around Sasan Gir have Gypsies and drivers, or will arrange them for you, charging ₹1500 or more per vehicle for up to six passengers. Alternatively, you can hire an open 4WD and driver for around ₹1300 outside the sanctuary reception centre, in Sasan Gir village. Once you have a vehicle sorted, you must queue up at the reception centre to obtain a permit and a guide, and pay photography fees. Your driver will usually help with this.
Permit-issuing times are posted at the reception centre: at the time of writing they were 5.30am, 8.30am and 2.30pm – but you’ll want to be at the reception centre with your passport much earlier to ensure you get a permit. It’s not unheard of for the early-morning queue to begin before midnight. If you can plan ahead, half of the permits issued each day can be booked online, from three months to 48 hours advance.
As a general rule, about one in every two safaris has a lion sighting. So if you’re determined to see lions, allow for a couple of trips. You’ll certainly see a variety of other wildlife, and the guides are adept spotters.

Gir Interpretation Zone
WILDLIFE WATCHING(Indian/foreigner Mon-Fri ₹75/1200, Sat & Sun ₹95/1500; h8-11am & 3-5pm)
Twelve kilometres west of Sasan Gir village at Devalia, within the sanctuary precincts, is the Gir Interpretation Zone, better known as simply Devalia. The 4- sq-km fenced-off compound is home to a cross-section of Gir wildlife. Chances of seeing lions here are good but stage-managed, and you’re only likely to get 30 to 45 minutes looking for wildlife and only from a bus. An autorickshaw/taxi round trip to Devalia from Sasan Gir village costs around ₹120/200.

THE LAST WILD ASIATIC LIONS
The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) once roared as far west as Syria and as far east as India’s Bihar. Widespread hunting decimated the population, with the last sightings recorded near Delhi in 1834, in Bihar in 1840 and in Rajasthan in 1870. In Gujarat, too, they were almost hunted to extinction, with as few as 12 remaining in the 1870s. It was not until one of their erstwhile pursuers, the enlightened Nawab of Junagadh, decided to set up a protection zone at the beginning of the 20th century that the lions began slowly to recover. This zone now survives as the Sasan Gir Wildlife Sanctuary.
Separated from their African counterpart (Panthera leo leo) for centuries, Asiatic lions have developed unique characteristics. Their mane is less luxuriant and doesn’t cover the top of the head or ears, while a prominent fold of skin runs the length of the abdomen. They are also purely predatory, unlike African lions which sometimes feed off carrion.
4 Sleeping & Eating It’s a good idea to make an advance booking. Sasan Gir has one main street and most accommodation is on it or nearby, with a few top-end options further away.

Junagadh
%0285 / Pop 320,250
Reached by few tourists, Junagadh is nestled against some of the most impressive topography in Gujarat. It’s an ancient, fortified city (its name means ‘old fort’) with 2300 years of history, at the base of holy Girnar Hill. The Nawab of Junagadh opted to take his tiny state into Pakistan at the time of Partition – a wildly unpopular decision as the inhabitants were predominantly Hindu, so the nawab departed on his own. Junagadh makes a good jumping-off point for seeing the lions at Sasan Gir.Junagadh

1 Sights & Activities While parts of the centre are as traffic-infested, crowded and hot as any other city, the area up towards Uparkot Fort and around Circle and Diwan Chowks is highly atmospheric, dotted with markets and half-abandoned palaces in Euro-Mughal style with grass growing out of their upper storeys.
o Girnar Hill
SACRED SITE
 
This sacred mountain, which rises dramatically from the plains, is covered with Jain and Hindu temples. Pilgrims from far and wide come to tackle the long climb up 10,000 stone steps to the summit, which is best begun at dawn. Be prepared to spend a full day if you want to reach the uppermost temples. Ascending in the early morning light is a magical experience, as pilgrims and porters begin to trudge up the well-maintained steps.
The Jain temples, a cluster of mosaic-decorated domes interspersed with elaborate stupas, are about two-thirds of the way up. The largest and oldest is the12th-century Temple of Neminath , dedicated to the 22nd tirthankar: go through the first left-hand doorway after the first gate. Many temples are locked from around 11am to 3pm, but this one is open all day. The nearby triple Temple of Mallinath , dedicated to the ninth tirthankar, was erected in 1177 by two brothers. During festivals this temple is a sadhu magnet.
Further up are various Hindu temples. The first peak is topped by the Temple of Amba Mata , where newlyweds worship to ensure a happy marriage. Beyond here there is quite a lot of down as well as up to reach the other four peaks and further temples. The Temple of Gorakhnath is perched on Gujarat’s highest peak at 1117m. The steep peak Dattatraya is topped by a shrine to a three-faced incarnation of Vishnu. Atop the final outcrop, Kalika, is a shrine to the goddess Kali.
The trail begins 4km east of the city at Girnar Taleti. A motorable road, which may or may not be open, leads to about the 3000th step, which leaves you only 7000 to go. Refreshment stalls on the ascent sell chalk, so you can graffiti your name on the rocks. If you can’t face the walk, dholis carried by porters cost ₹3850 (round trip) if you weigh between 50kg and 70kg, and ₹4250 for heavier passengers. If your weight range isn’t obvious, you suffer the indignity of being weighed on a huge beam scale before setting off. Note that while photography is permitted on the trail, it’s not allowed inside the temples.
The Bhavnath Mela, over five days in the month of Magha, brings folk music and dancing and throngs of nagas (naked sadhus or spiritual men) to Bhavnath Mahadev Temple at Girnar Taleti. It marks the time when Shiva is believed to have danced his cosmic dance of destruction.
An autorickshaw from town to Girnar Taleti costs about ₹70.

This ancient fort is believed to have been built in 319 BC by the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta, though it has been extended many times. In places the ramparts reach 20m high. It’s been besieged 16 times, and legend has it that the fort once withstood a 12-year siege. The views over the city and east to Girnar Hill are superb, and there are a number of interesting sights within its walls.The Jumma Masjid (

Just outside town on the road to Girnar Hill, a white building on the right encloses a large boulder on which the Buddhist emperor Ashoka had 14 edicts inscribed in Brahmi script in the Pali language about 250 BC. The spidery lettering instructs people to be kind to women and animals and give to beggars, among other things, and is one of several inscriptions that Ashoka placed all around his realm expounding his moral philosophy and achievements.

Rajkot
%0281 / Pop 1.28 million
Rajkot is a large, hectic commercial and industrial city that isn’t easy to love with its heavy traffic, lack of open spaces and scant worthwhile sights. But the old city, east of the newer centre, still has plenty of character, with narrow streets, markets, and farmers still selling ghee on street corners.,
,
gg
Rajkot was founded in 1612 by Jadeja Rajputs, and in colonial times it became the headquarters of the Western India States Agency, Britain’s administrative centre for some 400 princely states in Saurashtra, Kachchh and northern Gujarat. After Independence Rajkot was capital of the short-lived state of Saurashtra.Rajkot

This is the house where Gandhi lived from the age of six (while his father was diwan of Rajkot), and it contains lots of interesting information on his life. The Mahatma’s passion for the handloom is preserved in the form of a small weaving school.Handicrafts Workshops
The Patola-weaving skill comes from Patan, and is a torturous process that involves dyeing each thread before it is woven. In Patan, both the warp and weft threads are dyed (double ikat), in Rajkot only the weft is dyed (single ikat), so the product is more affordable. You can visit workshops in people’s houses in the Sarvoday Society area about 1km southwest of Shastri Maidan, including

Perhaps best of all, people here are exceedingly friendly.
Before Independence, Jamnagar was capital of the Nawanagar princely state. Today, Jamnagar is quite a boom town, with the world’s biggest oil refinery, belonging to Reliance Petroleum, not far west of the city. The whole central area is one big commercial zone, with more brightly lit shops and stalls at night than you’ll find in many a larger city.Jamnagar

Coral, octopus, anemones, puffer fish, sea horses, lobsters and crabs are among the marine life you may see in shallow water at low tide. The best time to visit is December to March, when wintering birds are plentiful.
The park has two sections: Narada and Poshitra. Narada is more interesting – from the entry gate, you park and hike 2.3km over rock and reef to the Gulf of Kachchh, where you can spot a variety of sea life. (You’ll want to wear footwear with decent soles, as the terrain is sharp.) Narada is best reached from Jamnagar, which is 65km away; hiring a car to get you there and back costs about ₹1800. Poshitra’s main draw is the coral; you won’t see many animate creatures there. Hiring a vehicle from Jamnagar costs ₹4000 whether you go one-way or round- trip; it’s closer to Dwarka, which is a reasonable base to visit from.
Narada and Poshitra are only open during low tide, so the entry schedule shifts
daily. To figure out what time to go, phone the Forest Office (

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
WESTERN SAURASHTRA
Mahatma Gandhi was born in 1869 in the chaotic port town of Porbandar, 130km southwest of Jamnagar. You can visit Gandhi’s birthplace (h9am-noon & 3-6pm) – a 22- room, 220-year-old house – and a memorial next door, Kirti Mandir. Dwarka, 106km from Jamnagar at the western tip of the Kathiawar Peninsula, is one of the four holiest Hindu pilgrimage sites in India – Krishna is said to have set up his capital here after fleeing from Mathura. Its Dwarkadhish Temple is believed to have been founded over 2500 years ago, and has a fantastically carved, 78m-high spire. The town swells tobreaking point for Janmastami (hAug/Sep) in celebration of Krishna’s birthday.
There are some good beaches on the ocean coast, including the beautiful, long, clean Okhamadhi, 22km south of Dwarka, where waves can be strong, and the calmer Shivrajpur, a long lagoon beach 12km north of Dwarka. En route to Porbandar, the Barda Wildlife Sanctuary is a hilly, forested area with stone-built villages, old temples and good hiking. A good contact for more information on visiting these and other off-the-beaten- track places in western Saurashtra is Mustak Mepani (%9824227786) at Jamnagar’s Hotel President.
KACHCHH (KUTCH)
Kachchh, India’s wild west, is a geographic phenomenon. The flat, tortoise- shaped land (kachbo means tortoise in Gujarati), edged by the Gulf of Kachchh and Great and Little Ranns, is a seasonal island. During the dry season, the Ranns are vast expanses of hard, dried mud. Come the monsoon, they’re flooded first by seawater, then by fresh river water. The salt in the soil makes the lowlying marsh area almost completely barren. Only on scattered ‘islands’ above the salt level is coarse grass which provides fodder for the region’s wildlife.
The villages dotted across Kachchh’s arid landscape are home to a jigsaw of tribal groups and sub-castes who produce some of India’s finest handicrafts, above all their textiles which glitter with exquisite embroidery and mirrorwork.
A branch of the Indus River once entered the Great Rann until a massive earthquake in 1819 altered its course. Another mammoth earthquake in January 2001 again altered the landscape, killing nearly 30,000 people and completely destroying many villages. Although the effects of the tragedy will resonate for generations, the residents have determinedly rebuilt their lives and are welcoming to visitors. Tax breaks to encourage economic recovery have brought in new industrial plants, but by and large Kachchh still remains a refreshingly pristine, rural environment.
KACHCHH CREATIVITY
Kachchh is one of India’s richest areas for handicrafts, particularly famed for its beautiful, colourful embroidery work (of which there are at least 14 distinct styles), but it also has many artisans specialising in weaving, tie-dyeing, block printing, wood carving, pottery and other crafts. The diversity of Kachchh crafts reflects the differing traditions of its

i         il       j             dhlmany communities. Numerous local cooperatives invest in social projects and help artisans produce work that is marketable yet still preserves their artistic heritage.
The tourist office offers autorickshaw tours that stop at most of the local cooperatives (half-/full day ₹600/1200) and can include visits to Ajir and Rabari villages; ask former tourism director Pramod Jethi what’s on the menu, and specify what you want to see and what you don’t.

The capital of Kachchh is an interesting city, mostly resurrected following the massive 2001 earthquake that destroyed much of the place. It sells amazing Kachchh handicrafts, and historic buildings such as the Aina Mahal and Prag Mahal possess an eerie beauty. Bhuj is an ideal springboard for visits to the surrounding villages, and textile tourism is attracting visitors from around the world.
The Jadeja Rajputs who took control of Kachchh in 1510 made Bhuj their capital 29 years later, and it has remained Kachchh’s most important town ever since.Bhuj

It’s in a sad state and most sections are closed,but it’s worth visiting for its ghostly Durbar Hall, a wonderful piece of decayed magnificence with broken chandeliers, rotting hunting trophies covered in bird droppings, and gold-skirted classical statues that wouldn’t look out of place decorating a nightclub.
The beautiful Aina Mahal (Old Palace;

₹30; h9am-noon & 3-6pm Fri-Wed), built in the 1750s, was badly damaged in the 2001 earthquake, but the 1st and 2nd floors are open again and contain a fascinating museum with excellent explanatory information in English. The palace was built for Maharao Lakhpatji by Ramsingh Malam, a sailor from Dwarka who had learned European arts and crafts on his travels. The elaborately mirrored interior is a demonstration of the maharao’s fascination with all things European – an inverted mirror of European Orientalism – with blue-and-white Delft-style tiling, a candelabra with Venetian-glass shades and the Hogarth lithograph series, The Rake’s Progress. In the bedroom is a bed with solid gold legs (the king apparently auctioned his bed annually). In the Fuvara Mahal room, fountains played around the ruler while he sat watching dancers or composing poems.
The 17th-century Rani Mahal (

This graceful 1867 Italianate palace, set among shade trees full of crows and bats, was the abode of the last maharao of Kachchh, Madansingh, until his death in 1991. It lost most of its 3rd floor in the 2001 earthquake, and the remaining lower floors are closed. However, the adjacent former dining hall now houses the palace’s eclectic museum collection. Standout exhibits are two huge stuffed tigers that the erstwhile maharao shot, and his coffin.

EXPLORING KACHCHH
It is possible to get out to Kachchh’s villages by public transport – for example, there are three buses a day to Khavda (₹50, two hours). You can also take autorickshaws to villages not too far from the city. But you’ll have many more options and more flexibility if you hire a car and driver; most Bhuj hotels can organise this for you.
Thoughtfully themed and customised autorickshaw tours (half-/full day ₹600/1200)
to villages outside Bhuj are organised by Pramod Jethi (

Around Bhuj
The local Jat, Ahir, Harijan, nomadic Rabari and other communities have distinct, colourful craft traditions that make their villages fascinating to visit.
Bhujodi , about 7km southeast of Bhuj, is a village of weavers, mostly using pit looms, operated by both feet and hands. You can look into many workshops, which produce attractive shawls, blankets and other products. The village is 1km off Hwy 42. You can take a bus towards Ahmedabad and ask the driver to drop you at the turn-off for Bhujodi (₹10). A return rickshaw from Bhuj costs ₹300.
In the hills about 60km northwest of Bhuj is the eerie monastery at Than . The holy man Dhoramnath, as penance for a curse he had made, stood on his head on top of Dhinodhar hill for 12 years. The gods pleaded with him to stop,and he agreed, provided the first place he looked at became barren – hence the Great Rann. He then established the monastic order of Kanphata (Split Ears, because of large piercings through the ear’s concha), whose monastery (dating back to at least the 12th century) stands at the foot of the hill. This is a laid-back place to explore the surrounding hills, and the architecture ranges from crumbling mud brick to Portuguese-style stucco, blue and whitewash bell towers, with a hint of basil and marigold in the air. There’s one bus daily to Than from Bhuj (₹50, two hours) at 5pm, returning early next morning. The monastery and the temple atop Dhinodhar have very basic guest rooms with mattresses on the floor and simple food (pay by donation) but no drinking water.
You need a permit to visit the villages of Lakhpat, Dhorodo, Khavda, and Ludia, but these are easy to obtain. For Lakhpat, take a copy of your passport and visa (and the originals) to the office of the District Superintendent of
Police (h10am-6pm Mon-Sat, closed 2nd & 4th Sat), 800m south of Kachchh Museum in
Bhuj, and you should get the permit (free of charge; maximum 10 days) straight away. Your driver will need a permit if you plan to stay overnight. For the other villages, get your permit at the police post on the way, in Bhirandiyara. It’s free, unless you plan on going into the White Rann north of Dhorodo – for that, pay ₹100. Drivers need permits for the White Rann, too.
Shaam-e-Sarhad Village Resort (%02803-296222; www.hodka.in; tent s/d
₹2800/3200, bhunga s/d ₹3800/4800, incl meals; hOct-Mar), just outside Hodka, in the
beautiful Banni grasslands 70km north of Bhuj, is a fascinating and successful project in ‘endogenous tourism’. Owned and operated by the Halepotra Maldharis, its accommodation consists of three bhungas (mud huts) with sloping roofs and groovy interiors, and six comfortable earth-floored tents, all with private bathroom and electricity. Local (non-English speaking) guides cost ₹300 per day for birdwatching or visits to villages in the area such as Hodka, Khavda (known for its pottery and textiles) or Ludia (known for its intricately decorated homes); to Kalo Dungar (Black Hill, Kachchh’s highest point at 462m above sea level); or to the Great Rann itself, with its snow-glare of salt (you may need to provide your own transport). You can also stop by for a superb thali lunch
(₹200) – call in advance.
The Centre for Desert & Ocean (CEDO; %02835-221284, 9825248135;www.cedobirding.com), 53km northwest of Bhuj, is a wildlife conservation organisation run by passionate environmentalist Jugal Tiwari. It does birding and wildlife trips focusing on the wildlife-rich Banni grasslands (between Sumrasar Sheikh and Khavda). Accommodation is in plain but well-kept rooms with 24- hour solar-heated hot water; meals are Gujarati vegetarian. Staying costs ₹1750 to ₹2000 per person per day, including meals. Safaris cost ₹3600 per day for a car and driver; expert naturalist/birder guides cost an extra ₹1800 per day.
A long drive northeast from Bhuj is the fascinating and remote archeaological site of Dholavira , on a seasonal island in the Great Rann. Excavations have revealed a complex town of stone buildings 1 sq km in area, inhabited by the Indus Valley civilisation from around 2900 to 1500 BC. It’s best to organise your own transport (₹4500 one-way or return): the only bus to Dholavira leaves Bhuj at 2pm (₹80, six hours) and starts back at 5am. The state-government-run
Toran Tourist Complex (%02837-277395; s/d ₹350/500, with AC ₹750/900; a) at
Dholavira offers basic accommodation and meals.
Mandvi
%02834 / Pop 48,500
Mandvi is an hour down the road from Bhuj and is a busy little place with an amazing shipbuilding yard. Hundreds of men construct, by hand, these wooden beauties for faraway Arab merchants. The massive timbers apparently come from Malaysian rainforests. Mandvi suffered far less destruction than Bhuj in the 2001 earthquake, so the heart of town (around Mochi Bazaar) is lined with beautiful old buildings in faded pastel hues and temples with wildly sculpted, cartoon-like facades. There are also some sweeping beaches, including the glorious, long, clean private beach near Vijay Vilas Palace, and public Kashivishvanath Beach, with food stalls and camel rides, 2km from the centre just east of the Rukmavati River.

Vijay Vilas Palace
PALACE(admission Mon-Sat ₹25, Sun ₹35, vehicle ₹40, camera/video ₹50/200; h7am-7pm)
Vijay Vilas Palace is a 1920s palace reminiscent of a large English country house, 7km west of town amid extensive orchards, and set by a magnificent private beach. Originally a summer abode for the Kachchh rulers, its 1st floor (out of bounds to visitors) is now the erstwhile royal family’s main residence. The view from the roof is worth the climb, and the gardens make a nice stroll.
Autorickshaws charge about ₹200/300 one-way/return from town. You can walk back to town along the beach if it’s low tide.

Wild Ass Sanctuary
The barren, blindingly white land of the Little Rann is nature at its harshest and most compelling. It’s best known as the home of the last remaining population of the chestnut-coloured Indian wild ass (also called khur), as well as bluebulls, blackbuck and chinkara. There’s also a huge bird population from October to March (this is one of the few areas in India where flamingos breed in the wild).
The Little Rann is punctuated by desolate salt farms, where people eke out a living by pumping up groundwater and extracting the salt. Heat mirages disturb the vast horizon – bushes and trees seem to hover above the surface. Rain turns the desert into a sea of mud, and even during the dry season the solid-looking,
gy
g
crust is often deceptive, so it’s essential you take a local guide when exploring the area.
The 4953-sq-km Wild Ass Sanctuary (4WD safari with up to 6 passengers
Indian/foreigner ₹350/1200 Mon-Fri, ₹435/1500 Sat-Sun, camera ₹100/600) covers a large part of
the Little Rann. Easily accessible from Ahmedabad, it can be combined with trips to Nalsarovar Bird Sanctuary, Modhera and Patan. About 3000 khurs live in the sanctuary, surviving off the flat, grass-covered expanses or islands, known as bets, which rise up to around 3m. These remarkable, notoriously untamable creatures are capable of running at an average speed of 50km/h for long distances.
Desert Coursers (%9426372113, 9427066070; www.desertcoursers.net), run by
infectiously enthusiastic naturalist Dhanraj Malik, organises excellent Little Rann safaris and village tours from its Camp Zainabad (per person incl full board ₹1900-2800; hOct-Mar; a), very close to the east edge of the Little Rann and just outside the small town of Zainabad, 105km northwest of Ahmedabad. The lodge has air-conditioned koobas (thatch-roofed huts) and excellent meals, in a peaceful, remote setting. The price includes a 4WD safari. Advance booking is advised.
To get to Zainabad from Ahmedabad, hiring a private car is easiest but you can also take a bus from Ahmedabad’s ST bus stand to Dasada, 10km away (₹80, 2½ hours, about hourly), from where Desert Coursers does free pickups. There are direct buses between Zainabad and Patan (₹75, 2½ hours, two daily) via Modhera. Desert Coursers can arrange taxis around the area if desired.
Rann Riders (%9925236014; www.rannriders.com; s/d incl all meals & safari ₹6000/7200;
aWs), near Dasada, is also family-run and offers luxurious cottage accommodation in pretty gardens, plus highly recommended 4WD and camel safaris and its own stable of indigenous horses for riding.
The simplest of the camps is the Eco Tour Camp (%9825548090;
www.littlerann.com; near Kidi Village; per person incl full board ₹1000-2000; hOct-Apr), run by the
personable Devjibhai Dhamecha, where you can stay in basic cement huts or round koobas. Situated right on the sanctuary’s edge, you can walk right into it and see wild asses, bluebulls and a bevy of birds – no guide is needed. 4WD safaris (₹2000/3000 per vehicle) are offered by Devjibhai’s son, Ajay, anenthusiastic guide who will take you through some of the less touristed parts of the sanctuary.
The camp is near Kidi village – Devjibhai arranges pickups (autorickshaw/taxi ₹600/1000) from the town of Dhrangadra, 45km away, on the main road and rail routes between Ahmedabhad (three hours) and Bhuj (5½ hours). The town of Halwad – also along the main highway – is much closer, but you have to arrange your own ride to the camp – a spot in the back of a chakda (half-motorcycle, half-pickup truck) should cost ₹20 from Halvad to Kidi. All buses between Ahmedabad and Bhuj stop at Dhrangadhra; only some stop at the Halwad bus stand. The guides mentioned will arrange your permits for the reserve; the cost of these is normally additional to safari prices.
An hour south of Dhrangadhra on the Ahmedabad–Rajkot highway is Sayla , a peaceful, pastoral town that swells during the Tarnetar Fair (hAug/Sep). Bell
Guest House (%9724678145; www.bellguesthouse.com; s/d incl breakfast ₹3550/4700; a),
presided over by the erstwhile ruling family of Sayla (and their yellow labs), is an ageing heritage hotel retreat down a lane off the Sayla roundabout on Hwy 8A. Rooms have modern en suite bathrooms. You can look for bluebulls and peacocks in the surrounding countryside or take trips further afield to see wild asses, blackbuck, the birds of Nalsarovar or a variety of artisans in area villages.Mumbai (Bombay)

Why Go?
Mumbai is big. It’s full of dreamers and hard-labourers, starlets and gangsters, stray dogs and exotic birds, artists and servants and fisherfolk and crorepatis(millionaires) and lots and lots of people. It has India’s most prolific film industry, some of Asia’s biggest slums (as well as the world’s most expensive home) and the largest tropical forest in an urban zone. Mumbai is India’s financial powerhouse, fashion epicentre and a pulse point of religious tension. It’s even evolved its own language, Bambaiyya Hindi, which is a mix of… everything.
If Mumbai is your introduction to India, prepare yourself. The city isn’t a threatening place but its furious energy, limited public transport and punishing pollution makes it challenging for visitors. The heart of the city contains some of the grandest colonial-era architecture on the planet but explore a little more and you’ll uncover unique bazaars, hidden temples, hipster enclaves and India’s premier restaurants and nightlife.

History Koli fisherfolk have inhabited the seven islands that form Mumbai from as far back as the 2nd century BC. Remnants of this culture remain huddled along the city shoreline today. A succession of Hindu dynasties held sway over the islands from the 6th century AD until the Muslim Sultans of Gujarat annexed the area in the 14th century, eventually ceding it to Portugal in 1534. The only memorable contribution the Portuguese made to the area was christening it Bom Bahai. They handed control to the English government in 1665, which leased the islands to the East India Company.
Bombay flourished as a trading port. The city’s fort was completed in they

p
1720s, and a century later ambitious land reclamation projects joined the islands into today’s single landmass. The city continued to grow, and in the 19th century the fort walls were dismantled and massive building works transformed the city in grand colonial style. When Bombay became the principal supplier of cotton to Britain during the American Civil War, the population soared and trade boomed as money flooded into the city.
Bombay was a major player in the Independence movement, and the Quit India campaign was launched here in 1942 by Mahatma Gandhi. The city became capital of the Bombay presidency after Independence, but in 1960 Maharashtra and Gujarat were divided along linguistic lines – and Bombay became the capital of Maharashtra.
The rise of the pro-Marathi, pro-Hindu regionalist movement in the 1980s, spearheaded by the Shiv Sena (literally ‘Shivaji’s Army’), shattered the city’s multicultural mould by actively discriminating against Muslims and non- Maharashtrians. Communalist tensions increased, and the city’s cosmopolitan self-image took a battering when 900 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in riots in late 1992 and 1993. The riots were followed by a dozen retaliatory bombings which killed 257 people and damaged the Bombay Stock Exchange.
Shiv Sena’s influence saw the names of many streets and public buildings – as well as the city itself – changed from their colonial-era monikers. In 1996 the city officially became Mumbai (derived from the Hindu goddess Mumba). The airport, Victoria Terminus and Prince of Wales Museum were all renamed after Chhatrapati Shivaji, the great Maratha leader.
Religious tensions deepened and became intertwined with national religious conflicts and India’s relations with Pakistan. A series of bomb attacks on trains killed over 200 in July 2006. Then, in November 2008, a coordinated series of devastating attacks (by Pakistani militants) targeted landmark buildings across the city. As the Taj Mahal Palace hotel burned, passengers were gunned down inside the Chhatrapati Shivaji train station and 10 people were killed inside the Leopold Cafe backpacker haunt.
In late 2012, when the Sena’s charismatic founder Bal Thackeray died (500,000 attended his funeral), the Shiv Sena mission begin to falter, and in the 2014 assembly elections, President Modi’s BJP became the largest party in Mumbai.Mumbai.
Despite recent troubles Mumbaikars are a resilient bunch. Increased security is very much part of everyday life today and the city’s status as the engine room of the Indian economy remains unchallenged. However, the Mumbai politicians certainly have their work cut out, with the megacity’s feeble public transport, gridlocked streets, pollution and housing crisis all in desperate need of attention.

1 Sights Mumbai is an island connected by bridges to the mainland. The city’s commercial and cultural centre is at the southern, claw-shaped end of the island known as South Mumbai. The southernmost peninsula is Colaba, traditionally the travellers’ nerve centre, with many of the major attractions.
Directly north of Colaba is the busy commercial area known as Fort, where the British fort once stood. This part of the city is bordered on the west by a series of interconnected grassy areas known as maidans (pronounced may- dahns).
Continuing north you enter ‘the suburbs’ which contain the airport and manyContinuing north you enter ‘the suburbs’ which contain the airport and many of Mumbai’s best restaurants, shopping and nightspots. The upmarket districts of Bandra, Juhu and Lower Parel are key areas.
Colaba
Along the city’s southernmost peninsula, Colaba is a bustling district packed with elegant art-deco and colonial-era mansions, budget-to-midrange lodgings, bars and restaurants, street stalls and a fisherman’s quarter. Colaba Causeway (Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg) dissects the district.
If you’re here in August, look out for the Koli festival Nariyal Poornima, which is big in Colaba.Colaba1 Top Sights

Mumbai’s most famous landmark, this stunning hotel is a fairy-tale blend of Islamic and Renaissance styles, and India’s second-most photographed monument. It was built in 1903 by the Parsi industrialist JN Tata, supposedly after he was refused entry to one of the European hotels on account of being ‘a native’. Dozens were killed inside the hotel when it was targeted during the 2008 terrorist attacks, and images of its burning facade were beamed across the world. The fully restored hotel reopened on Independence Day 2010.

MONUMENT

GOOGLE MAP
 )
This bold basalt arch of colonial-era triumph faces out to Mumbai Harbour from the tip of Apollo Bunder. Incorporating Islamic styles of 16th-century Gujarat, it was built to commemorate the 1911 royal visit of King George V, but wasn’t completed until 1924. Ironically, the British builders of the gateway used it just 24 years later to parade the last British regiment as India marched towards independence.
These days, the gateway is a favourite gathering spot for locals and a top place for people-watching. Giant-balloon sellers, photographers, vendors making bhelpuri (thin fried rounds of dough with rice, lentils, lemon juice, onion, herbs and chutney) and touts rub shoulders with locals and tourists, creating all the hubbub of a bazaar. In March, they are joined by classical dancers and musicians who perform during the Elephanta Festival.
Boats depart from the gateway’s wharfs for Elephanta Island.

MUMBAI IN…
TWO DAYS
Begin at one of the city’s architectural masterpieces, the Chhatrapati Shivaji MaharajVastu Sangrahalaya museum, before grabbing a drink in Pantry and exploring the galleries and scene in the bohemian Kala Ghoda district. Lunch Gujarati-style at Samrat.
In the afternoon continue admiring Mumbai’s marvellous buildings around the Oval Maiden and Marine Dr before heading to Colaba, the heart of the city. Tour the city’s iconic sights, the Gateway of India and Taj Mahal Palace hotel around sunset, and be sure to have a drink at the Harbour Bar. In the evening either fine dine at Indigo or chow down at Bademiya, followed by (for those with the stamina) a nightcap at sky bar Aer.
The next day, head to the grand-daddy of Mumbai’s colonial-era giants, the old Victoria Terminus train station, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Then investigate Crawford Market and its maze of bazaars, hidden temples and unique street life. Lunch at Revival. Make your way over to Mani Bhavan, the museum dedicated to Gandhi, and finish the day wandering the tiny lanes of Khotachiwadi followed by a beach sunset and bhelpuri at Girgaum Chowpatty. In the evening head to hip nightlife hub Bluefrog for dinner, and then bop to a band or DJ.
Fort Area & Churchgate
Lined up in a row and vying for your attention with aristocratic pomp, many of Mumbai’s majestic Victorian buildings pose on the edge of Oval Maidan. This land, and the Cross and Azad Maidans immediately to the north, was on the oceanfront in those days, and this series of grandiose structures faced west directly to the Arabian Sea.
Kala Ghoda, or ‘Black Horse’, is a hip, atmospheric sub-neighbourhood of Fort just north of Colaba. It contains many of Mumbai’s museums and galleries alongside a wealth of colonial-era buildings and some of the city’s best restaurants and cafes.Fort Area & Churchgate

HISTORIC BUILDING

GOOGLE MAP
 )
Imposing, exuberant and overflowing with people, this monumental train station is the city’s most extravagant Gothic building and an aphorism for colonial-ear India. It’s a meringue of Victorian, Hindu and Islamic styles whipped into an imposing Daliesque structure of buttresses, domes, turrets, spires and stained- glass. As historian Christopher London put it, ‘the Victoria Terminus is to the British Raj what the Taj Mahal is to the Mughal empire’British Raj what the Taj Mahal is to the Mughal empire’.
Some of the architectural detail is incredible, with dog-faced gargoyles adorning the magnificent central tower and peacock-filled windows above the central courtyard. Designed by Frederick Stevens, it was completed in 1887, 34 years after the first train in India left this site.
Officially renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) in 1998, it’s still better known locally as VT. Sadly, its interior is far less impressive, with ugly modern additions and a neglected air – stray dogs roam around the ticket offices – despite the structure’s Unesco World Heritage Site status.

A hive of daily activity, packed with judges, barristers and other cogs in the Indian justice system, the High Court is an elegant 1848 neo-Gothic building. The design was inspired by a German castle and was obviously intended to dispel any doubts about the authority of the justice dispensed inside.
Visitors are permitted to explore the building and attend cases. Inside it’s quite a spectacle, with court officials kitted out in starched white tunics offset with red cummerbunds and scarlet berets, while robed barristers strut about with their chests puffed out.

This storied wadi (hamlet) is a bastion clinging onto Mumbai life as it was before high- rises. A Christian enclave of elegant two-storey wooden mansions, it’s 500m northeast ofGirgaum Chowpatty, lying amid Mumbai’s predominantly Hindu and Muslim neighbourhoods. These winding lanes allow a wonderful glimpse into a quiet(ish) life free of rickshaws and taxis. It’s not large, but you can spend a little while wandering the alleyways and admiring the old homes and, around Christmas, their decorations.
To find Khotachiwadi, aim for St Teresa’s Church (

corner of Jagannath Shankarsheth Marg (JSS Marg) and Rajarammohan Roy Marg (RR Rd/Charni Rd), then head directly opposite the church on JSS Marg and duck down the second and third lanes on your left.
GROWING PAINS
Shoehorned into a narrow peninsula that juts into the Arabian Sea, Mumbai is one of the world’s most congested and densely populated megacities. The numbers are startling: over 22 million live in the Mumbai conurbation and around 60% of these live in slums.
While the city is blessed with sea to the west and a large bay to the east, it’s also cursed by the narrowness of the spit of land it calls home. Every day over six million commuters from the outer suburbs attempt to reach their workplaces in the south of the city via a network of antiquated suburban trains and buses. A desperately needed metro link to the heart of the city is planned (but not scheduled to be completed until at least 2020, if on time). For years the city planners invested in an ever-increasing number of flyovers, as car ownership has grown by 58% since 2000, while failing to build a single bus lane or cycle path. Gridlock is the norm and the pollution is punishing, with particulate and nitric oxide levels way above WHO danger levels.
The future of the city is in the balance. Mumbai is one of the least green cities on earth, with open spaces, parks and recreation grounds accounting for only 2.5% of its total area (Delhi has 20%, Chandigarh 35%). Yet on the eastern side of town, stretching north from the shoreline of Colaba, is a vast area of decaying docklands which has been long-slated for redevelopment. Will it be set aside for green space, parks and leisure facilities or luxury housing and concrete?

The leader formulated his philosophy of satyagraha (nonviolent protest) and launched the 1932 Civil Disobedience campaign from here. Exhibitions include a photographic record of his life, along with dioramas and documents, such as letters he wrote to Adolf Hitler and Franklin D Roosevelt and tributes from Ho Chi Minh and Einstein.Kalbadevi to Mahalaxmi

Floating like a sacred mirage off the coast, this Indo-Islamic shrine located on an offshore inlet is a striking sight. Built in the 19th century, it contains the tomb of the Muslim saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. Legend has it that Haji Ali died while on a pilgrimage to Mecca and his casket miraculously floated back to this spot.
It’s only possible to visit the shrine at low tide, via a long causeway (check tide times locally). Thousands of pilgrims, especially on Thursday and Friday (when there may be qawwali, devotional singing), cross it daily, many donating to beggars who line the way.
Sadly parts of the shrine are in a poor state, damaged by storms and the saline air, though a renovation plan exists. It’s visited by people of all faiths.

A focus for intense, celebratory worship in the sedate suburbs, this temple is a compelling place to visit. Iskcon Juhu has a key part in the Hare Krishna story, as founder AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada spent extended periods here (you can visit his modest living quarters in the adjacent building). The temple compound comes alive during prayer time as the faithful whip themselves into a devotional frenzy of joy, with kirtan dancing accompanied by crashing hand symbols and drumbeats.
Murals around the compound detail the Hare Krishna narrative. The Iskcon hotel here is also recommended, as is the canteen (meals ₹70).
DHARAVI SLUM
Mumbaikars were ambivalent about the stereotypes in 2008’s Slumdog Millionaire, but slums are very much a part of – some would say the foundation of – Mumbai city life. An astonishing 60% of Mumbai’s population lives in slums, and one of the city’s largest slums is Dharavi. Originally inhabited by fisherfolk when the area was still creeks, swamps and islands, it became attractive to migrant workers from South Mumbai andbeyond when the swamp began to fill in due to natural and artificial causes. It now incorporates 2.2 sq km of land sandwiched between Mumbai’s two major train lines, and is home to perhaps as many as a million people.
While it may look a bit shambolic from the outside, the maze of dusty alleys and sewer- lined streets of this city-within-a-city are actually a collection of abutting settlements. Some parts of Dharavi have mixed populations, but in other parts inhabitants from different parts of India, and with different trades, have set up homes and tiny factories. Potters from Saurashtra (Gujarati) live in one area, Muslim tanners in another; embroidery workers from Uttar Pradesh work alongside metalsmiths; while other workers recycle plastics as women dry pappadams in the searing sun. Some of these thriving industries, as many as 20,000 in all, export their wares, and the annual turnover of business from Dharavi is thought to exceed US$700 million.
Up close, life in the slums is fascinating to witness. Residents pay rent, most houses have kitchens and electricity, and building materials range from flimsy corrugated-iron shacks to permanent multistorey concrete structures. Perhaps the biggest issue facing Dharavi residents is sanitation, as water supply is irregular – every household has a 200L drum for water storage. Very few dwellings have a private toilet or bathroom, so some neighbourhoods have constructed their own (to which every resident must contribute financially) while other residents are forced to use rundown public facilities.
Many families have been here for generations, and education achievements are higher than in many rural areas: around 15% of children complete a higher education and find white-collar jobs. Many choose to stay, though, in the neighbourhood they grew up in.
Slum tourism is a polarising subject, so you’ll have to decide for yourself. If you opt to visit, Reality Tours & Travel does a illuminating tour, and puts a percentage of profits back into Dharavi. Some tourists opt to visit on their own, which is OK as well – just don’t take photos. Take the train from Churchgate station to Mahim, exit on the west side and cross the bridge into Dharavi.
To learn more about Mumbai’s slums, check out Katherine Boo’s 2012 book Behind the Beautiful Forevers, about life in Annawadi, a slum near the airport, and Rediscovering Dharavi, Kalpana Sharma’s sensitive and engrossing history of Dharavi’s people, culture and industry.

WORTH A TRIP
THE GREAT WALL OF MUMBAI
Starting as an initiative by artists to add colour to a suburban street in Bandra, the Wall Project (www.thewallproject.com) has introduced vibrant public art, murals and graffiti across the city. There’s no official membership, and the art has been created by both amateurs and professionals.
The guidelines are that no advertising, political statements, religious content or obscene messaging should be used. Social messaging that’s too preachy is not encouraged either.
Hundreds of individuals have joined the project, with most murals dealing with personal stories: their dreams, desire for change, criticisms and frustrations.
Perhaps the most spectacular stretch is a 2km canvas along Senapati Bapat Marg (Tulsi Pipe Rd), between the train stations of Mahim and Dadar on the Western Line, where the art parallels the tracks. It’s a very thought-provoking and enriching experience to take in; allow an hour and a half to explore.
This particular wall had long been coveted by the Wall Project founders, but they expected firm opposition from the authorities. Instead they were actually approached by the city’s Municipal Commissioner, who invited them to create something. Around 400 people contributed.
Many murals on Senapati Bapat Marg have a theme that’s relevant to India and Mumbai such as the environment, pollution and pressures of metropolitan life. One mural of a Mumbai cityscape simply says ‘Chaos is our Paradise'.
Another area rich in street art is Bandra, where many walls and bridges have been customised: Chapel Lane is a good place to start investigating.

Northeast of the Gateway of India in Mumbai Harbour, the rock-cut temples on Gharapuri, better known as Elephanta Island, are a Unesco World Heritage Site. Created between AD 450 and 750, the labyrinth of cave temples represent some of India’s most impressive temple carving. The main Shiva-dedicated temple is an intriguing latticework of courtyards, halls, pillars and shrines; its magnum opus is a 6m-tall statue of Sadhashiva, depicting a three-faced Shiva as the destroyer, creator and preserver of the universe, his eyes closed in eternal contemplation.
It was the Portuguese who dubbed the island Elephanta because of a large stone elephant near the shore (this collapsed in 1814 and was moved by the British to Mumbai’s Jijamata Udyan). There’s a small museum on-site, with informative pictorial panels on the origin of the caves.
Pushy, expensive guides are available – but you don’t really need one as Pramod Chandra’s A Guide to the Elephanta Caves, widely for sale, is more than sufficient.

THE PARSIS
Mumbai is home to the world’s largest surviving community of Parsis, people of the ancient Zoroastrian faith, who fled Iran in the 10th century to escape religious persecution from invading Muslims. ‘Parsi’ literally means Perisan. Zoroastrians believe in a single deity, Ahura Mazda, who is worshipped at agiaries (fire temples) across Mumbai, which non-Parsis are forbidden to enter. Parsi funeral rites are unique: the dead are laid out on open-air platforms to be picked over by vultures. The most renowned ofthese, the Tower of Silence, is located below the Hanging Gardens in Malabar Hill, yet screened by trees and hidden from public view.
The Mumbai Parsi community is extremely influential and successful, with a 98.6% literacy rate (the highest in the city). Famous Parsis include the Tata family (India’s foremost industrialists), author Rohinton Mistry and singer-songwriter Freddie Mercury. If you want to try Parsi cusine, head to Brittania restaurant.

Mumbai’s defining feature is its distinctive mix of colonial-era and art-deco architecture. Starting from the 1 Gateway of India, walk up Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg past the art-deco residential-commercial complex 2 Dhunraj Mahal, towards 3 Regal Circle. Walk the circle for views of the surrounding buildings – including the art-deco 4 Regal cinema and the 5 Majestic Hotel, now the Sahakari Bhandar cooperative store. Continue up MG Rd, past the beautifully restored facade of the 6 National Gallery of Modern Art. Opposite is the landmark 7 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya built in glorious Indo- Saracenic style. Back across the road is the ‘Romanesque Transitional’ 8 Elphinstone College and the 9 David Sassoon Library & Reading Room, where members escape the afternoon heat lazing on planters’ chairs on the upper balcony. Continue north to admire the vertical art-deco stylings of the a New India Assurance Company Building. On an island ahead lies b Flora Fountain, depicting the Roman goddess of flowers. Turn east down Veer Nariman Rd, walking towards c St Thomas’ Cathedral. Ahead lies the stately d Horniman Circle, an arcaded ring of buildings laid out in the 1860s around a beautifully kept botanical garden. It’s overlooked from the east by the neoclassical e Town Hall, home to the Asiatic Society library. Backtrack to Flora Fountain, continuing west and turning south onto Bhaurao Patil Marg to see the august f High Court and the ornate g University of Mumbai. The university’s 80m-high h Rajabai Clock Tower is best observed from within the i Oval Maidan. Turn around to compare the colonial-era edifices with the row of art-deco beauties lining Maharshi Karve (MK) Rd, culminating in the wedding-cake tower of j Eros Cinema.

Colaba is home to most of the cheap tourist haunts, while Fort and Churchgate are more upscale, a trend that continues as you head north to Mahalaxmi and the western suburbs, where you’ll find Mumbai’s most international and expensive restaurants.
Sample Gujarati or Keralan thalis (all-you-can-eat meals), Mughlai kebabs, Goan vindaloo and Mangalorean seafood. And don’t forget, if you see Bombay duck on a menu, it’s actually bombil (fish dried in the sun and deep-fried).
STREET FOOD
Mumbai’s street cuisine is vaster than many Western culinary traditions. Stalls tend to get started in late afternoon, when chai complements much of the fried deliciousness; items are ₹10 to ₹25.
Most street food is vegetarian. Chowpatty Beach is a great place to try Mumbai’s famous bhelpuri (thin fried rounds of dough, with rice, lentils, onions, herbs and chutneys). Stalls offering samosas, pav bhaji (spiced vegetables and bread), vada pav (deep-fried spiced lentil-ball sandwich), bhurji pav (scrambled eggs and bread) and dabeli (a mixture of potatoes, spices, peanuts and pomegranate, also on bread) are spread through the city.
For a meaty meal, Mohammed Ali and Merchant Rds in Kalbadevi are famous for kebabs. In Colaba, Bademiya is a late-night Mumbai rite of passage, renowned for its chicken tikka rolls.
The office workers’ district on the north side of Kala Ghoda is another good hunting ground for street snacks.

DABBA-WALLAHS
A small miracle of logistics, Mumbai’s 5000 dabba-wallahs (literally ‘food container person’; also called tiffin-wallahs) work tirelessly to deliver hot lunches to office workers throughout the city.
Lunch boxes are picked up each day from restaurants and homes and carried on heads, bicycles and trains to a centralised sorting station. A sophisticated system of numbers and colours (many wallahs don’t read) identifies the destination of each lunch. More than 200,000 meals are delivered – always on time, come (monsoon) rain or (searing) shine.
This system has been used for over a century and there’s only about one mistake per six million deliveries. (In a 2002 analysis, Forbes Magazine found that the dabba-wallahs had a six-sigma, or 99.99966%, reliability rating.) Look for these master messengers mid-morning at Churchgate and CST stations.
6 Drinking & Nightlife Forget the capital, Mumbai is a city that really knows how to enjoy itself. Whatever your tipple and whatever your taste, you’ll find it here – from dive bar to sky bar. Colaba is rich in unpretentious pub-like joints (but also has some very classy places), while Bandra and Juhu are home turf for the filmi and model set. Some of the most intriguing new places are opening in midtown areas such as Lower Parel.
Wednesday and Thursday are big nights at some clubs, as well as the traditional Friday and Saturday; there’s usually a cover charge. Dress codes apply, so don’t rock up in shorts and sandals. The trend in Mumbai is towards resto-lounges as opposed to full-on nightclubs.
You’re also technically supposed to have a license to drink in Maharashtra;some bars require you to buy a temporary one, for a nominal fee.

BOLLYWOOD DREAMS
Mumbai is the glittering epicentre of India’s gargantuan Hindi-language film industry. From silent beginnings, with a cast of all-male actors (some in drag) in the 1913 epic Raja Harishchandra, and the first talkie, Lama Ara (1931), it now churns out more than 1000 films a year – more than Hollywood. Not surprising considering it has a captive audience of one-sixth of the world’s population.
Every part of India has its regional film industry, but Bollywood continues to entrance the nation with its escapist formula in which all-singing, all-dancing lovers fight and conquer the forces keeping them apart. These days, Hollywood-inspired thrillers and action extravaganzas vie for moviegoers’ attention alongside the more family-oriented saccharine formulas.Bollywood stars can attain near godlike status in India and star-spotting is a favourite pastime in Mumbai’s posher establishments. You can also see the stars’ homes as well as a film/TV studio with Bollywood Tours (www.bollywoodtours.in; 8hr tour per person ₹6000), but you’re not guaranteed to see a dance number and you may spend much of it in traffic.
EXTRA, EXTRA!
Studios sometimes want Westerners as extras to add a whiff of international flair (or provocative dress, which locals often won’t wear) to a film.
If you’re game, just hang around Colaba (especially the Salvation Army hostel) where studio scouts, recruiting for the following day’s shooting, will find you. A day’s work, which can be up to 16 hours, pays ₹500. You’ll get lunch, snacks and (usually) transport. The day can be long and hot with loads of standing around the set; not everyone has a positive experience. Complaints range from lack of food and water to dangerous situations and intimidation when extras don’t comply with the director’s orders. Others describe the behind-the-scenes peek as a fascinating experience. Before agreeing to anything, always ask for the scout’s identification and go with your gut.
7 Shopping Mumbai is India’s great marketplace, with some of the best shopping in the country.
Be sure to spend a day at the markets north of CST for the classic Mumbai shopping experience. In Fort, booksellers, with surprisingly good wares (not all pirated), set up shop daily on the sidewalks around Flora Fountain. Snap up a bargain backpacking wardrobe at Fashion Street (MG Rd), the strip of stalls lining MG Rd between Cross and Azad Maidans. Hone your bargaining skills. Kemp’s Corner has many good shops for designer threads.

THE ART DISTRICT
India’s contemporary art scene has exploded in recent years, and Mumbai, along with Delhi, is the centre of the action. A slew of galleries are showing incredible work in some gorgeous spaces across the city.
Kala Ghoda hosts a wonderful two-week festival each February, with some great exhibitions (as well as music, theatre, dance and literary events).
Year-round, the second Thursday of each month is ‘Art Night Thursday’, when galleries stay open late and the vibe is social. Gallery crawls are sometimes organised; check Mumbai Boss (www.mumbaiboss.com) for the latest or the free fold-up Mumbai Art Map, available at galleries and bookstores. To go more in depth, check out the magazine Art India, available at most English-language bookshops, which has news, background and criticism on work from across the country.
Or, just read nothing and go see pretty things on your own: many galleries are within walking distance of one another in Colaba and Fort. If street art is more your thing, don’t miss the Great Wall of Mumbai.

WORTH A TRIP
BAZAAR DISTRICT
Mumbai’s main market district is one of Asia’s most fascinating, an incredibly dense combination of humanity and commerce that’s a total assault on the senses. If you’ve just got off a plane from the West, or a taxi from Bandra – hold on tight. This working- class district stretches north of Crawford Market up as far as Chor Bazaar, a 2.5km walk away. Such are the crowds (and narrowness of the lanes) that you should allow yourself two to three hours to explore it thoroughly.
You can buy just about anything here, but as the stores and stalls are very much geared to local tastes, most of the fun is simply taking in the street life and investigating the souk-like lanes rather than buying souvenirs. The markets merge into each other in an amoeba-like mass, but there are some key landmarks so you can orientate yourself.
Crawford Market
(Mahatma Phule Market; 
MARKET
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ; cnr DN & Lokmanya Tilak Rds)
Crawford Market is the largest in Mumbai, and contains the last whiff of British Bombay before the tumult of the central bazaars begins. Bas-reliefs by Rudyard Kipling’s father, Lockwood Kipling, adorn the Norman Gothic exterior. Fruit and vegetables, meat and fish are mainly traded, but it’s also an excellent place to stock up on spices.
If you’re lucky to be here during alphonso mango season (May to June) be sure to indulge.

8 Getting There & Away
AIR
Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, about 30km from the city centre, was nearing the end of a $2 billion modernisation program at the time of research. The impressive international terminal is complete, while its new domestic terminal should be fully operational some time in 2015, creating a fully integrated airport.
At the time of writing, the airport still comprised of one international terminal and a separate domestic terminal (also known locally as Santa Cruz airport) 5km away. A free shuttle bus runs between the two terminals every half-hour (journey time 15 minutes) for ticket-holders. Both terminals have ATMs, foreign-exchange counters and tourist-information booths.Travel agencies and airlines' websites are usually best for booking flights. The following airlines maintain offices in town and/or at the airport.
Major nonstop domestic flights from Mumbai include the following:

METRO

The first section of Line 1, Mumbai’s new metro (www.mumbaimetroone.com) opened in 2014. Initially it only connected seven stations in the far northern suburbs, well away from anywhere of interest to visitors. However Line 1 is scheduled to be extended south as far as Jacob Circle (5km north of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus) sometime in 2015, bringing it past nightlife hub Lower Parel.
Single fares cost between ₹10 and ₹20, with monthly Trip Passes (from
₹600) also available. Access to stations is by escalator, carriages are air- conditioned, and there are seats reserved for women and the disabled. Trains run every minutes.
Line 3 (a 33km underground line connecting Cuffe Pde south of Colaba, all the main railway terminals, Bandra and the airport) will be the next line to be constructed. It’s been approved but won’t open for many years.

TAXI & AUTORICKSHAW
Mumbai’s black-and-yellow taxis are very inexpensive and the most convenientway to get around southern Mumbai; drivers almost always use the meter without prompting. The minimum fare is ₹21 (for up to 1.6km), a 5km trip costs about ₹50.
Autorickshaws are the name of the game north of Bandra. The minimum fare is ₹17, up to 1.6km, a 3km trip is about ₹30.
Both taxis and autorickshaws tack 25% onto the fare between midnight and
5am.
Tip: Mumbaikars tend to navigate by landmarks, not street names (especially new names), so have some details before heading out.
TRAIN
Mumbai’s suburban train network is one of the world's busiest; forget travelling during rush hours.
Trains run from 4am to 1am and there are three main lines: A Western Line The most useful; operates out of Churchgate north to Charni Rd (for Girgaum Chowpatty), Mumbai Central, Mahalaxmi (for the Dhobi Ghat), Bandra, Vile Parle (for the domestic airport), Andheri (for the international airport) and Borivali (for Sanjay Gandhi National Park), among others.
A Central Line Runs from CST to Byculla (for Veermata Jijabai Bhonsle Udyan, formerly Victoria Gardens), Dadar and as far as Neral (for Matheran).
From Churchgate, 2nd-/1st-class fares are ₹5/48 to Mumbai Central, ₹8/85 to Vile Parle, and ₹9/116 to Borivali.
To avoid the queues, buy a coupon book (₹50), good for use on either train line, then ‘validate’ the coupons at the machines before boarding.
‘Tourist tickets’ permit unlimited travel in 2nd/1st class for one (₹75/225), three (₹115/415) or five (₹135/485) days.
Watch your valuables, and gals, stick to the ladies-only carriages except late at night, when it’s more important to avoid empty cars.Maharashtra

MaharashtraWhy Go?
India’s third-largest and second-most populous state, Maharashtra is an expansive canvas showcasing many of India’s iconic attractions. There are lazy, palm-fringed beaches, lofty, cool-green mountains, World Heritage Sites and bustling cosmopolitan cities. In the far east of the state are some of the nation’s most impressive national parks, including the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve.
Inland lie the extraordinary cave temples of Ellora and Ajanta, undoubtedly Maharashtra’s greatest monuments, hewn by hand from solid rock. Matheran, a colonial-era hill station served by a toy train, has a certain allure. Pilgrims and inquisitive souls are drawn to cosmopolitan Pune, a city famous for its ‘sex guru’ and alternative spiritualism. And westwards, the romantic Konkan Coast fringing the Arabian Sea is lined with spectacular, crumbling forts and sandy beaches, some of the best around the pretty resort of Malvan, which is fast becoming one of India’s premier diving centres.
When to GoA Jan It’s party time at Nasik’s wineries, marked by grape harvesting and crushing galas.
A Sep The frenzied, energetic Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations reach fever pitch. A Dec Clear skies, mild temperatures; the secluded beaches of Murud, Ganpatipule and Tarkali are lovely.

a Learning about the Gandhian way of life at the Sevagram AshramHistory Maharashtra was given its political and ethnic identity by Maratha leader Chhatrapati Shivaji (1627–80), who lorded over the Deccan plateau and much of western India from his stronghold at Raigad. Still highly respected today, Shivaji is credited for instilling a strong, independent spirit among the region’s people, as well as establishing Maharashtra as a dominant player in the power relations of medieval India.
From the early 18th century, the state was under the administration of a succession of ministers called the Peshwas, who ruled until 1819, ceding thereafter to the British. After Independence in 1947, western Maharashtra and Gujarat were joined to form Bombay state. But it was back to the future in 1960, when modern Maharashtra was formed with the exclusion of Gujarati-speaking areas and with Mumbai (Bombay) as its capital.
Since then the state has forged ahead to become one of the nation’s most prosperous, with one of India’s largest industrial sectors, partly thanks to its technology parks and software exports.
1 National Parks & Reserves Maharashtra has over 30 wildlife sanctuaries, including six tiger reserves: Tadoba- Andhari, Pench and Navagaon are all grouped around the inland city of Nagpur. In the far south of the state the Malvan National Marine Park protects coral reefs, islets and coastal mangroves.
8 Getting There & Away Mumbai is Maharashtra’s main transport hub, though Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur also have busy airports.
Jalgaon station is an important gateway for Ajanta.
Goa airport is handily placed for the far southern resort of Malvan.8 Getting Around Because the state is so large, internal flights (eg Pune to Nagpur) will really speed up your explorations.
The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC;
www.msrtc.gov.in) runs a comprehensive bus network spanning all major towns and many remote places. Private operators also have comfortable Volvo and Mercedes-Benz services between major cities.
Renting a car and driver to explore the Konkan coastline is a good option as public transport is poor on this stretch: allow four or five days to travel between Mumbai and Goa.

Located on the banks of the holy Godavari River, Nasik (or Nashik) gets its name from the episode in the Ramayana where Lakshmana, Rama’s brother, hacked off the nasika (nose) of Ravana’s sister. Today this large provincial city’s old quarter has some intriguing temples that reference the Hindu epic and some huge bathing ghats. Every 12 years, Nasik plays host to the grand Kumbh Mela, the largest religious gathering on Earth (the last one was in 2015, the next one in 2027).
As India’s best wines are produced locally, an afternoon touring the vineyards is another good reason to drop by.Nasik

This bathing ghat in the heart of Nasik’s old quarter sees hundreds of Hindu pilgrims arriving daily to bathe, pray and – because the waters provide moksha (liberation of the soul) – to immerse the ashes of departed friends and family.

GRAPES OF NASIK
From wimpy raisins to full-bodied wines, the grapes of Nasik have come a long way. The surrounding region had been producing table grapes since ancient times. However, it was only in the early 1990s that a couple of entrepreneurs realised that Nasik, with its fertile soils and temperate climate, boasted good conditions for wine cultivation. In 1997p
g
industry pioneer Sula Vineyards fearlessly invested in a crop of sauvignon blanc and chenin blanc, and the first batch of domestic wines hit the shelves in 2000. Nasik hasn’t looked back.
These days, the wine list in most of Nasik’s wineries has stretched to include shiraz, merlot, cabernet, semillon and zinfandel as well as a few sparkling wines, and most of these drops can be sampled first-hand by visiting one of the estates.
During harvest season (January to March), some wineries also organise grape- crushing festivals, marked by unbridled revelry. Events are usually advertised on the wineries’ websites.
Sula Vineyards
VINEYARD
(%09970090010; www.sulawines.com; Gangapur-Savargaon Rd, Govardhan; h11am-10pm) Sula Vineyards, located 15km west of Nasik, offers a slick, professional tour (around 45 minutes) of its impressive estate and high-tech facilities. This is rounded off with a wine- tasting session (four/six wines ₹150/250) that features its best drops and offers excellent tasting tips. The cafe here has commanding views of the countryside (though only snacks are sold and it does get very busy); for meals the neighbouring French restaurant Soleil by La Plage is recommended.

Five reds, a rosé and chenin blanc are produced. There’s a large garden where Western snacks (olives, cheeses) are offered.
Around Nasik
Bhandardara
The picturesque village of Bhandardara is nestled deep in the folds of the Sahyadris, about 70km from Nasik. A little-visited place surrounded by craggy mountains, it is one of Maharashtra’s best escapes from the bustle of urban India.Most of Bhandardara’s habitation is thrown around Arthur Lake, a horseshoe-shaped reservoir fed by the waters of the Pravara River. The lake is barraged on one side by the imposing Wilson Dam, a colonial-era structure dating back to 1910. If you like walking, consider a hike to the summit of Mt Kalsubai, which at 1646m was once used as an observation point by the Marathas. Alternatively, you could hike to the ruins of the Ratangad Fort, another of Shivaji’s erstwhile strongholds, which has wonderful views of the surrounding ranges.
The charming Anandvan Resort (%9920311221; www.anandvanresorts.com; d from
₹7350; a), a hilltop hotel with a choice of comfy cottages and villas overlooking Arthur Lake, allows you to sleep in style, while the MTDC Holiday Resort
(%0242-4257032; budget/deluxe r from ₹1100/4000; a), further down the hill, has both
renovated comfortable rooms and reasonable budget options.
Bhandardara can be accessed by taking a local bus from Nasik’s Mahamarg bus stand to Ghoti (₹38, one hour), from where an autorickshaw ride costs ₹90. A taxi from Nasik can also drop you at your resort for about ₹1500.
Igatpuri
Heard of vipassana, haven’t you? Well head to Igatpuri to see where (and how) it all happens. Located about 44km south of Nasik, this village is home to the headquarters of the world’s largest vipassana meditation institution, the
Vipassana International Academy (%02553244076; www.dhamma.org; donations
accepted), which institutionalises this strict form of meditation first taught by Gautama Buddha in the 6th century BC and reintroduced to India by teacher SN Goenka in the 1960s. Ten-day residential courses (advance bookings compulsory) are held throughout the year, though teachers warn that it requires rigorous discipline. Basic accommodation, food and meditation instruction are provided free of charge, but donations upon completion are accepted. Consult the academy website for detailed transport information; options from Nasik include share taxi and state bus links (both leave from the New Central bus stand).

Trimbakeshwar Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
(entrance ₹200 to avoid queue; h 5.30am-9pm)
The moody Trimbakeshwar Temple stands in the centre of Trimbak, 33km west of Nasik. It’s one of India’s most sacred temples, containing a jyoti linga, one of the 12 most important shrines to Shiva. Only Hindus are allowed in, but non- Hindus can peek into the courtyard. Nearby, the waters of the Godavari River flow into the Gangadwar bathing tank, where all are welcome to wash away their sins.
Regular buses run from the Old Central bus stand in Nasik to Trimbak (₹30, 45 minutes).
Aurangabad
%0240 Pop 1.28 million Elev 515m
Aurangabad lay low through most of the tumultuous history of medieval India and only hit the spotlight when the last Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, made the city his capital from 1653 to 1707. With the emperor’s death came the city’s rapid decline, but the brief period of glory saw the building of some fascinating monuments, including a Taj Mahal replica (Bibi-qa-Maqbara), and these continue to draw a steady trickle of visitors. Alongside other historic relics, such as a group of ancient Buddhist caves, these Mughal relics make Aurangabad a good choice for a weekend excursion from Mumbai. But the real reason for traipsing here is because the town is an excellent base for exploring the World Heritage Sites of Ellora and Ajanta.
Silk fabrics were once Aurangabad’s chief revenue generator, and the town is still known across the world for its hand-woven Himroo and Paithani saris.
The train station, cheap hotels and restaurants are clumped together in the south of the town along Station Rd East and Station Rd West. The MSRTC bus stand is 1.5km to the north of the train station. Northeast of the bus stand is the buzzing old town, with its narrow streets and Muslim quarter.Aurangabad1 Top Sights 1Bibi-qa-MaqbaraB1

Built by Aurangzeb’s son Azam Khan in 1679 as a mausoleum for his mother Rabia-ud-Daurani, Bibi-qa-Maqbara is widely known as the poor man’s Taj. With its four minarets flanking a central onion-domed mausoleum, the white structure certainly does bear a striking resemblance to Agra’s Taj Mahal. It is much less grand, however, and apart from having a few marble adornments, namely the plinth and dome, much of the structure is finished in lime mortar.
Apparently the prince conceived the entire mausoleum in white marble, but was thwarted by his frugal father who opposed his extravagant idea of draining state coffers for the purpose. However, despite the use of cheaper material and the obvious weathering, it’s a sight far more impressive than the average gravestone.
The Bibi’s formal gardens are a delight to explore, with the Deccan hills providing a scenic backdrop.

Architecturally speaking, the Aurangabad Caves aren’t a patch on Ellora or Ajanta, but they do throw some light on early Buddhist architecture and, above all, make for a quiet and peaceful outing. Carved out of the hillside in the 6th or 7th century AD, the 10 caves, comprising two groups 1km apart (retain your ticket for entry into both sets), are all Buddhist. Cave 7, with its sculptures of scantily clad lovers in suggestive positions, is a perennial favourite.
The caves are about 2km north of Bibi-qa-Maqbara. A return autorickshaw from the mausoleum shouldn’t cost more than ₹180 including waiting time.

Himroo saris start at around ₹1200, for a cotton and silk blend. Paithani saris, which are of a superior quality, range from ₹5000 to ₹300,000 – but some of them take more than a year to make. If you’re buying, make sure you get authentic Himroo, not ‘Aurangabad silk’.

8 Getting There & Away
AIR
The airport is 10km east of town. Daily direct flights go to Delhi (around ₹8500) and Mumbai (around ₹4500) with both Air India and Jet Airways.
BUS
Buses leave about every half-hour from the MSRTC bus stand ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Station Rd West) to Pune (semideluxe/deluxe ₹330/620, five hours)
and roughly hourly to Nasik (semideluxe ₹290, 4½ hours) between 8am and
10pm. Private bus agents ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) are clustered on Dr
Rajendra Prasad Marg and Court Rd; a few sit closer to the bus stand. Deluxe overnight bus destinations include Mumbai (with/without AC from ₹550/350, sleeper ₹900 to ₹1500, 7½ to 9½ hours), Ahmedabad (seat ₹400, sleeper ₹800 to ₹1050, 13 to 15 hours) and Nagpur (sleeper with AC ₹600, without AC ₹700 to ₹1050, 8½ to 10 hours).
Ordinary buses head to Ellora from the MSRTC bus stand every half-hour (₹30, one hour) and hourly to Jalgaon (₹155, four hours) via Fardapur (₹95, 2½ hours), which is the drop-off point for Ajanta.
From the CIDCO bus stand (

 ; Airport Rd), by the Lemon Tree
hotel junction, ordinary buses leave for the Lonar meteorite crater (every two hours, 4½ hours, ₹172).
TRAIN
Aurangabad’s train station (Station Rd East) is not on a main line, but it has four daily direct trains to/from Mumbai. The Tapovan Express (2nd class/chair
₹140/500, 7½ hours) departs Aurangabad at 2.35pm; the Janshatabdi Express (2nd class/chair ₹172/575, 6½ hours) departs Aurangabad at 6am. For Hyderabad, trains include the Ajanta express (sleeper/2nd class/1st class
₹805/1150/1925, 10 hours, 10.45pm). To reach northern or eastern India, take abus to Jalgaon and board a train there.
8 Getting Around Autorickshaws are common here. The taxi stand
(

 ) is next to the MSRTC bus stand; shared 4WDs also
depart from here for Ellora and Daulatabad but are usually very packed. Renting a car and driver is a much better option.
Ashoka Tours & Travels rates for return trip with a car/driver to Ellora is
₹1250/1400 in a car/AC car; to Ajanta it’s ₹2080/2400.
Around Aurangabad
Daulatabad
This one’s straight out of a Tolkien fantasy. A most beguiling structure, the
12th-century hilltop fortress of Daulatabad is located about 15km north of Aurangabad, en route to Ellora. Now in ruins, the citadel was originally conceived as an impregnable fort by the Yadava kings. Its most infamous high point came in 1328, when it was named Daulatabad (City of Fortune) by eccentric Delhi sultan Mohammed Tughlaq and made the capital – he even marched the entire population of Delhi 1100km south to populate it. Ironically, Daulatabad – despite being better positioned strategically than Delhi – soon proved untenable as a capital due to an acute water crisis, and Tughlaq forced the weary inhabitants all the way back to Delhi, which had by then been reduced to a ghost town.
Daulatabad’s central bastion sits atop a 200m-high craggy outcrop known as Devagiri (Hill of the Gods), surrounded by a 5km fort (Indian/foreigner ₹10/100; h6am-6pm). The climb to the summit takes about an hour, and leads past an ingenious series of defences, including multiple doorways designed with odd angles and spike-studded doors to prevent elephant charges. A tower of victory, known as the Chand Minar (Tower of the Moon), built in 1435, soars 60m above the ground to the right; it’s closed to visitors. Higher up, you can walk into the Chini Mahal, where Abul Hasan Tana Shah, king of Golconda, was held captivefor 12 years before his death in 1699. Nearby, there’s a 6m cannon, cast from five different metals and engraved with Aurangzeb’s name.
Part of the ascent goes through a pitch-black, bat-infested, water-seeping, spiralling tunnel. Guides (₹500) are available near the ticket counter to show you around, and their torch-bearing assistants will lead you through the dark passageway for a small tip. On the way down you’ll be left to your own devices, so carry a torch.
As the fort is in ruins (with crumbling staircases and sheer drops) and involves a steep ascent, the elderly, children and those suffering from vertigo or claustrophobia will find it a tough challenge. Allow 2½ hours to explore the structure, and bring water.
Khuldabad
Time permitting, take a pit stop in the scruffy-walled settlement of Khuldabad (Heavenly Abode), a quaint little Muslim pilgrimage village just 3km from Ellora. Buried deep in the pages of history, Khuldabad is where a number of historic figures lie interred, including emperor Aurangzeb, the last of the Mughal greats. Despite matching the legendary King Solomon in terms of state riches, Aurangzeb was an ascetic in his personal life, and insisted that he be buried in a simple tomb, which you’ll find in the courtyard of the Alamgir Dargah (h7am-
8pm).
Generally a calm place, Khuldabad is swamped with pilgrims every April when a robe said to have been worn by the Prophet Mohammed, and kept within the dargah (shrine), is shown to the public. Across the road from the Alamgir Dargah, another shrine is said to contain strands of the Prophet’s beard.
Ellora
%02437
Give a man a hammer and chisel, and he’ll create art for posterity. Come to the
World Heritage–listed Ellora cave temples (Indian/foreigner ₹10/250; hdawn-dusk
Wed-Mon), 30km northwest of Aurangabad, and you’ll know exactly what wemean. The epitome of ancient Indian rock-cut architecture, these caves were chipped out laboriously over five centuries by generations of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monks. Monasteries, chapels, temples – the caves served every purpose, and they were stylishly embellished with a profusion of remarkably detailed sculptures. Unlike the caves at Ajanta, which are carved into a sheer rock face, the Ellora caves line a 2km-long escarpment, the gentle slope of which allowed architects to build elaborate courtyards in front of the shrines, and render them with sculptures of a surreal quality.
Ellora has 34 caves in all: 12 Buddhist (AD 600–800), 17 Hindu (AD 600– 900) and five Jain (AD 800–1000) – though the exact time-scales of these caves’ construction is the subject of academic debate. Undoubtedly the grandest is the awesome Kailasa Temple (Cave 16), the world’s largest monolithic sculpture, hewn top to bottom against a rocky slope by 7000 labourers over a period of 150 years. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, it is clearly among the best that ancient Indian architecture has to offer.
The established academic theory is that the site represents the renaissance of Hinduism under the Chalukya and Rashtrakuta dynasties, the subsequent decline of Indian Buddhism and a brief resurgence of Jainism under official patronage. However, due to the absence of inscriptional evidence, it’s been impossible to accurately date most of Ellora’s monuments. Some scholars argue that some Hindu temples predate those in the Buddhist group. What is certain is that their coexistence at one site indicates a lengthy period of religious tolerance.
Official guides can be hired at the ticket office in front of the Kailasa Temple for ₹1070 (up to five people). Guides have an extensive knowledge of cave architecture so are worth the investment. If your tight itinerary forces you to choose between Ellora or Ajanta, Ellora wins hands down in terms of architecture (though Ajanta’s setting is more beautiful and more of a pleasure to explore).
Ellora is very popular with domestic tourists; if you can visit on a weekday, it’s far less crowded. The whole complex is in desperate need of reorganising: currently the car park is far too close to the temples so expect plenty of background honking and beeping as you tour the caves. Rubbish is also a big problem.1 Sights
o Kailasa Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
 
One of Incredible India’s greatest monuments, this astonishing temple, carved from solid rock, was built by King Krishna I in AD 760 to represent Mt Kailasa (Kailash), Shiva’s Himalayan abode. To say that the assignment was daring would be an understatement. Three huge trenches were bored into the sheer cliff face, a process that entailed removing 200,000 tonnes of rock by hammer and chisel, before the temple could begin to take shape, and its remarkable sculptural decoration added.
Covering twice the area of the Parthenon in Athens and being half as high again, Kailasa is an engineering marvel that was executed straight from the head with zero margin for error. Modern draughtsmen might have a lesson or two to learn here.
The temple houses several intricately carved panels, depicting scenes from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the adventures of Krishna. Also worth admiring are the immense monolithic pillars that stand in the courtyard, flanking the entrance on both sides, and the southeastern gallery that has 10 giant and fabulous panels depicting the different avatars of Lord Vishnu.
After you’re done with the main enclosure, bypass the hordes of snack- munching day trippers to explore the temple’s many dank, bat-urine-soaked corners with their numerous forgotten carvings. Afterwards, hike up a foot trail to the south of the complex that takes you to the top perimeter of the ‘cave’, from where you can get a bird’s-eye view of the entire temple complex.Buddhist Caves
CAVE
 
Calm and contemplation infuse the 12 Buddhist caves, which stretch to the south of Kailasa. All are Buddhist viharas (monasteries) used for study and worship, but the multistoreyed structures also included cooking, living and sleeping areas.
The one exception is Cave 10, which is a chaitya (assembly hall). While the earliest caves are simple, Caves 11 and 12 are more ambitious; both have three storeys and are on par with the more impressive Hindu temples.
Cave 1 , the simplest vihara, may have been a granary. Cave 2 is notable for its ornate pillars and the imposing seated Buddha, which faces the setting sun. Cave 3 and Cave 4 are unfinished and not well preserved.
Cave 5 is the largest vihara in this group, at 18m wide and 36m long; the rows of stone benches hint that it may once have been an assembly hall.
Cave 6 is an ornate vihara with wonderful images of Tara, consort of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, and of the Buddhist goddess of learning, Mahamayuri, looking remarkably similar to Saraswati, her Hindu equivalent.
Cave 7 is an unadorned hall, but from here you can pass through a doorway to
Cave 8 , the first cave in which the sanctum is detached from the rear wall.
Cave 9 is notable for its wonderfully carved fascia.
Cave 10 is the only chaitya in the Buddhist group and one of the finest in India. Its ceiling features ribs carved into the stonework; the grooves were once fitted with wooden panels. The balcony and upper gallery offer a closer view of the ceiling and a frieze depicting amorous couples. A decorative window gently illuminates an enormous figure of the teaching Buddha.
Cave 11 , the Do Thal (Two Storey) Cave, is entered through its third basement level, not discovered until 1876. Like Cave 12, it possibly owes its size to competition with Hindu caves of the same period.
Cave 12 , the huge Tin Thal (Three Storey) Cave, is entered through a courtyard. The locked shrine on the top floor contains a large Buddha figure flanked by his seven previous incarnations. The walls are carved with relief pictures.Hindu Caves
CAVES
 
Drama and excitement characterise the Hindu group (Caves 13 to 29). In terms of scale, creative vision and skill of execution, these caves are in a league of their own.
All these temples were cut from the top down, so it was never necessary to use scaffolding – the builders began with the roof and moved down to the floor. Highlights include caves 14, 15, 16, 21 and 29.
Cave 13 is a simple cave, most likely a granary. Cave 14 , the Ravana-ki- Khai, is a Buddhist vihara converted to a temple dedicated to Shiva sometime in the 7th century.
Cave 15 , the Das Avatara (Ten Incarnations of Vishnu) Cave, is one of the finest at Ellora. The two-storey temple contains a mesmerising Shiva Nataraja, and Shiva emerging from a lingam (phallic image) while Vishnu and Brahma pay homage.
Caves 17 to 20 and caves 22 to 28 are simple monasteries.
Cave 21 , known as the Ramesvara Cave, features interesting interpretations of familiar Shaivite scenes depicted in the earlier temples. The figure of the goddess Ganga, standing on her Makara (mythical sea creature), is particularly notable.
The large Cave 29 , the Dumar Lena, is thought to be a transitional model between the simpler hollowed-out caves and the fully developed temples exemplified by the Kailasa. It has views over a nearby waterfall.
Jain Caves
CAVES
 
The five Jain caves, the last created at Ellora, may lack the ambitious size of the best Hindu temples, but they are exceptionally detailed, with some remarkable paintings and carvings.
The caves are 1km north of the last Hindu temple (Cave 29) at the end of the bitumen road; autorickshaws run here from the main car park.
Cave 30 , the Chhota Kailasa (Little Kailasa), is a poor imitation of the greatKailasa Temple and stands by itself some distance from the other Jain temples. In contrast, Cave 32 , the Indra Sabha (Assembly Hall of Indra), is the finest
of the Jain temples. Its ground-floor plan is similar to that of the Kailasa, but the upstairs area is as ornate and richly decorated as the downstairs is plain. There are images of the Jain tirthankars (great teachers) Parasnath and Gomateshvara, the latter surrounded by wildlife. Inside the shrine is a seated figure of Mahavira, the last tirthankar and founder of the Jain religion.
Cave 31 is really an extension of Cave 32. Cave 33 , the Jagannath Sabha, is similar in plan to 32 and has some well-preserved sculptures. The final temple, the small Cave 34 , also has interesting sculptures. On the hilltop over the Jain temples, a 5m-high image of Parasnath looks down on Ellora.

Ajanta
%02438
Superbly set in a remote river valley 105km northeast of Aurangabad, the remarkable cave temples of Ajanta are this region’s second World Heritage Site. Much older than Ellora, these secluded caves date from around the 2nd century BC to the 6th century AD and were among the earliest monastic institutions to be constructed in the country. Ironically, it was Ellora’s rise that brought about Ajanta’s downfall, and historians believe the site was abandoned once the focus had shifted to Ellora.
Ajanta was deserted for about a millennium, as the Deccan forest claimed and shielded the caves, with roots and shoots choking the sculptures, until 1819, when a British hunting party led by officer John Smith stumbled upon them purely by chance.
One of the primary reasons to visit Ajanta is to admire its renowned ‘frescoes’, actually temperas, which adorn many of the caves’ interiors. With few other examples from ancient times matching their artistic excellence and fine execution, these paintings are of unfathomable heritage value. It’s believed that the natural pigments for these paintings were mixed with animal glue and vegetable gum, to bind them to the dry surface. Many caves have small, crater- like holes in their floors, which acted as palettes during paint jobs.
Despite their age, the paintings in most caves remain finely preserved today, and many attribute it to their relative isolation from humanity for centuries. However, it would be a tad optimistic to say that decay hasn’t set in.1 Sights
o Ajanta Caves
(Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video ₹25, authorised guide ₹750; h9am-5.30pm Tue-Sun)
CAVE
Ajanta’s caves line a steep face of a horseshoe-shaped gorge bordering the Waghore River. Five of the caves are chaityas (prayer halls) while others are viharas (monasteries). Caves 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and part of 15 are early Buddhist caves, while the others date from around the 5th century AD (Mahayana period). In the austere early Buddhist school, the Buddha was never represented directly but always alluded to by a symbol such as the footprint or wheel of law.
During busy periods, viewers are allotted 15 minutes within the caves, many of which must be entered barefoot (socks or shoe covers allowed). Caves 3, 5, 8, 22, 28, 29 and 30 remain either closed or inaccessible.Cave 1
CAVE
 
Cave 1, a Mahayana vihara, was one of the last to be excavated and is the most beautifully decorated. This is where you’ll find a rendition of the Bodhisattva Padmapani, the most famous and iconic of the Ajanta artworks. A verandah in front leads to a large congregation hall, housing sculptures and narrative murals known for their splendid perspective and elaborate detailing of dress, daily life and facial expressions. The colours in the paintings were created from local minerals, with the exception of the vibrant blue made from Central Asian lapis lazuli. Look up to the ceiling to see the carving of four deer sharing a common head.
Cave 2
CAVE
 
Cave 2 is a late Mahayana vihara with deliriously ornamented columns and capitals, and some fine paintings. The ceiling is decorated with geometric and floral patterns. The murals depict scenes from the Jataka tales, including Buddha’s mother’s dream of a six-tusked elephant, which heralded his conception.
Cave 4
CAVE
 
Cave 4 is the largest vihara at Ajanta and is supported by 28 pillars. Although never completed, the cave has some impressive sculptures: four statues surround a huge central Buddha, and there are scenes of people fleeing from the ‘eight great dangers’ to the protection of Avalokitesvara.
Cave 6

Cave 9 is one of the earliest chaityas at Ajanta. Although it dates from the early Buddhist period, the two figures flanking the entrance door were probably later Mahayana additions. Columns run down both sides of the cave and around the 3m-high dagoba at the far end.
Cave 10
CAVE
 
Cave 10 is thought to be the oldest cave (200 BC) and was the first one to be spotted by the British hunting party. Similar in design to cave 9, it is the largest chaitya. The facade has collapsed and the paintings inside have been damaged, in some cases by graffiti dating from soon after their rediscovery. One of the pillars to the right bears the engraved name of Smith, who left his mark here for posterity.
Cave 16
CAVE
 
Cave 16, a vihara, contains some of Ajanta’s finest paintings and is thought to have been the original entrance to the entire complex. The best known of these paintings is the ‘dying princess’ – Sundari, wife of the Buddha’s half-brother Nanda, who is said to have fainted at the news that her husband was renouncing the material life (and her) in order to become a monk. Carved figures appear to support the ceiling, and there’s a statue of the Buddha seated on a lion throne teaching the Noble Eightfold Path.
Cave 17

ti    th    ill
17 h    Aj   t ’  b   t
CAVE
dWith carved dwarfs supporting the pillars, cave 17 has Ajanta’s best-preserved and most varied paintings. Famous images include a princess applying make-up, a seductive prince using the old trick of plying his lover with wine, and the Buddha returning home from his enlightenment to beg from his wife and astonished son. A detailed panel tells of Prince Simhala’s expedition to Sri Lanka: with 500 companions he is shipwrecked on an island where ogresses appear as enchanting women, only to seize and devour their victims. Simhala escapes on a flying horse and returns to conquer the island.
Cave 19
CAVE
 
Cave 19, a magnificent chaitya, has a remarkably detailed facade; its dominant feature is an impressive horseshoe-shaped window. Two fine, standing Buddha figures flank the entrance. Inside is a three-tiered dagoba with a figure of the Buddha on the front. Outside the cave, to the west, sits a striking image of the Naga king with seven cobra hoods around his head. His wife, hooded by a single cobra, sits by his side.
Cave 24
CAVE
 
Had it been finished, cave 24 would be the largest vihara at Ajanta. Here you can see how the caves were constructed – long galleries were cut into the rock and then the rock between them was broken through.
Cave 26
CAVE
 
A largely ruined chaitya, cave 26 is now dramatically lit and contains some fine sculptures that shouldn’t be missed. On the left wall is a huge figure of the reclining Buddha, lying back in preparation for nirvana. Other scenes include a lengthy depiction of the Buddha’s temptation by Maya.
Cave 27
 
Cave 27 is virtually a vihara connected to the cave 26 chaitya.
CAVEViewpoints
Two lookouts offer picture-perfect views of the whole horseshoe-shaped gorge. The first is a short walk beyond the river, crossed via a bridge below cave 8. A further 40-minute uphill walk (not to be attempted during the monsoons) leads to the lookout from where the British party first spotted the caves.
AJANTA ETIQUETTE
Flash photography is strictly prohibited within the caves, due to its adverse effect on natural dyes used in the paintings. Authorities have installed rows of tiny pigment- friendly lights, which cast a faint glow within the caves, but additional lighting is required for glimpsing minute details, and you’ll have to rely on long exposures for photographs.
Most buses ferrying tour groups don’t arrive until noon. To avoid the crowds stay locally in Fardapur or make an early start from Aurangabad.
4 Sleeping & Eating Accommodation options close to the caves are quite limited. Aurangabad (or even Jalgaon) has far more choice, while Fardapur is the closest option and most convenient for arriving at the caves early morning.

WORTH A TRIP
LONAR METEORITE CRATER
If you like off-beat adventures, travel to Lonar to explore a prehistoric natural wonder. About 50,000 years ago, a meteorite slammed into the earth here, leaving behind a massive crater, 2km across and 170m deep. In scientific jargon, it’s the only hypervelocity natural-impact crater in basaltic rock in the world. In lay terms, it’s as tranquil and relaxing a spot as you could hope to find, with a shallow green lake at its base and wilderness all around. The lake water is supposedly alkaline and excellent for the skin. Scientists think that the meteorite is still embedded about 600m below the southeastern rim of the crater.
The crater’s edge is home to several Hindu temples as well as wildlife, including langurs, peacocks, deer and numerous birds.
The MTDC Tourist Complex (%07260221602; d with/without AC ₹1300/2590; a) has a prime location just across the road from the crater, and offers newly renovated deluxe rooms that are in excellent shape, with stylish en-suite bathrooms.

THE LEGEND OF BABA AMTE
The legend of Murlidhar Devidas ‘Baba’ Amte (1914–2008) is oft-repeated in humanitarian circles around the world. Hailing from an upper-class Brahmin family in Wardha, Amte was snugly ensconced in material riches and on his way to becoming a successful lawyer, when he witnessed a leper die unattended in the streets one night. It was an incident that changed him forever.
Soon after, Amte renounced worldly comforts, embracing an austere life through which he actively worked for the benefit of leprosy patients and those belonging to marginalised communities. In the primitive forested backyards of eastern Maharashtra, he set up his ashram called Anandwan (Forest of Joy; %07176-282034; www.anandwan.in). A true Gandhian, Amte believed in self-sufficiency, and his lifelong efforts saw several awards being conferred upon him, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1985.
Amte’s work has been continued by his sons Vikas and Prakash and their wives – the latter couple also won the Magsaysay Award in 2008. The family now runs many ashrams in these remote parts to care for the needy, both humans and animals. Over 2500 people are currently cared for, including 1500 leprosy patients. Animals in the ‘orphanage’ include otters, eagles, crocodiles, monkeys, wild boars, deer, hyenas, snakes, leopards and lions. There’s also a school for tribal people.
Volunteering opportunities are available and donations welcome (via website).

Around Nagpur
Ramtek
About 40km northeast of Nagpur, Ramtek is believed to be the place where Lord Rama, of the epic Ramayana, spent some time during his exile with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana. The place is marked by a cluster of temples (h6am- 9pm) about 600 years old, which sit atop the Hill of Rama and have their own population of resident monkeys. Autorickshaws will cart you the 5km from the bus stand to the temple complex for ₹80. You can return to town via the 700 steps at the back of the complex. On the road to the temples you’ll pass the delightful Ambala Tank, lined with small shrines. Boat rides around the lake are available.
Buses run half-hourly between Ramtek and the MSRTC bus stand in Nagpur (₹52, 1½ hours). The last bus to Nagpur is at 7pm.Sevagram
%07152
About 85km from Nagpur, Sevagram (Village of Service) was chosen by Mahatma Gandhi as his base during the Indian Independence Movement. Throughout the freedom struggle, the village played host to several nationalist leaders, who would regularly come to visit the Mahatma at his Sevagram
Ashram (%07152-284753; www.gandhiashramsevagram.org; h9am-noon & 2-6pm). The
overseers of this peaceful ashram, built on 40 hectares of farmland, have carefully restored the original huts where Gandhi lived and worked, and which now house some of his personal effects.
Very basic lodging is available in the Yatri Nivas (%284753; d ₹100), across the road from the entry gate; advance booking is recommended. Simple vegetarian meals can be served in the ashram’s dining hall with prior notice.
Just 3km from Sevagram, Paunar village is home to the Brahmavidya
Mandir Ashram (%07152-288388; h6am-noon & 2-8pm). Founded by Vinoba Bhave,
a nationalist and disciple of Gandhi, the ashram is run almost entirely by women. Modelled on swaraj (self-sufficiency), it’s operated on a social system of consensus, with no central management.
Sevagram can be reached by taking a Wardha-bound bus from Nagpur (₹85, three hours).
Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve
One of the best places to see tigers in India, the seldom-visited Tadoba- Andhari Tiger Reserve (hdawn-dusk Wed-Mon), 150km south of Nagpur, is now much more accessible thanks to the upgrading of state highways. Seeing fewer visitors than most other forest reserves in India, this is a place where you can get up close with wildlife without having to jostle past truckloads of shutter-happy tourists. Mammals in the reserve include gaurs, chitals, nilgais, sloth bears and leopards as well as very healthy tiger numbers (estimated at around 120, with 24 cubs born in 2014). Of the 280 bird species logged in the park, there’s a raptor population that includes crested serpent eagles, oriental honey buzzards and rarespecies of owls. The park also remains open throughout the year, unlike many in India.
Walking safaris (₹850) in the buffer zone allow you to look for tracks, observe birds and insects at close quarters, and catch the scents and sounds of wild India. Guides from the Gond tribe accompany you through the forest.
Guided canoe trips (₹1200 per person) on the Irai and Tadoba Lakes allow you the chance to explore inlets, islands and bays, with a chance of seeing crocodiles and magnificent birdlife, including the grey-headed fish eagle, ospreys and storks. Electric pontoon boats (₹800 per person) also operate.
Four state buses ply the road between Nagpur and Chandrapur (₹138, 3½ hours).

Konkan Coast
A little-developed shoreline running south from Mumbai all the way to Goa, this picturesque strip of coast is peppered with postcard beaches, fishing villages and magnificent ruined forts. Travelling through this tropical backwater can be sheer bliss. However, remember that accommodation is scant and transport limited and a little unreliable.

Murud

The sleepy fishing hamlet of Murud – 165km from Mumbai – should be on any itinerary of the Konkan Coast. The relaxed pace of life, fresh seafood, stupendous offshore Janjira fort (and the chance to feel the warm surf rush past your feet) makes the trip here well worthwhile.
Murud’s beach is fun for a run or game of cricket with locals. Alternatively, you could peer through the gates of the off-limits Ahmedganj Palace, estate of the Siddi Nawab of Murud, or scramble around the decaying mosque and tombs on the south side of town.
1 Sightso Janjira
(h7am-dusk)
FORT
The commanding, brooding fortress of Janjira, built on an island 500m offshore, is the most magnificent of the string of forts which line the Konkan coastline. This citadel was completed in 1571 by the Siddis, descendants of slaves from the Horn of Africa, and was the capital of a princely state.
Over the centuries Siddi alignment with Mughals provoked conflict with local kings, including Shivaji and his son Sambhaji, who attempted to tunnel to it. However, no outsider (including British, French and Portuguese colonists) ever made it past the fort’s 12m-high granite walls which, when seen during high tide, seem to rise straight from the sea. Unconquered through history, the fort is finally falling to forces of nature as its mighty walls slowly crumble and wilderness reclaims its innards.
Still, there’s a lot to see today, including the remarkable close-fitting stonework that’s protected the citadel against centuries of attack by storms, colonists and gunpowder. You approach the fort via a brooding grey-stone gateway, and then can explore its ramparts (complete with giant cannons) and 19 bastions, large parts of which are intact. Its inner keep, palaces and mosque are in ruins, though the fort’s huge twin reservoirs remain. As many of the surviving walls and structures are in poor shape, tread carefully as you explore the site, which is unfortunately littered with trash.
The only way to reach Janjira is by boat (₹20 return, 20 minutes) from Rajpuri port. Boats depart from 7am to 4.45pm daily and allow you 45 minutes to explore the fort. To get to Rajpuri from Murud, take an autorickshaw (₹75) or hire a bicycle.

Raigad Fort
Alone on a high and remote hilltop, 24km off Hwy 66, the enthralling Raigad
Fort (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h8am-5.30pm) served as Shivaji’s capital from 1648
until his death in 1680. The fort was later sacked by the British, and some colonial structures added, but monuments such as the royal court, plinths of royal chambers, the main marketplace and Shivaji’s tomb still remain, and it’s worth an excursion.
You can hike a crazy 1475 steps to the top. But for a more ‘levitating’ experience, take the vertigo-inducing ropeway (www.raigadropeway.com; return ₹200; h8.30am-5.30pm) – actually a cable car – which climbs up the cliff and offers a bird’s-eye view of the deep gorges below. Be warned this is a very popular attraction with domestic tourists and you may have to wait up to an hour for a ride during holiday times. Guides (₹200) are available within the fort complex. Sarja Restaurant (snacks ₹30-100), adjoining the ropeway’s base terminal, is a good place for lunch or snacks.
Autorickshaws (₹180, 45 minutes) shuttle up to Raigad from the town of Mahad on Hwy 66 (look out for the ‘Raigad Ropeway’ sign). Mahad is 158km south of Mumbai and 88km from Murud. The Mahad–Raigad road is paved and in good condition. Taxis charge ₹2000 for a day trip here from Murud.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK THE ROAD TO RUINSA scenic coastal road parallels the shoreline north of Murud, skirting headlands, beaches and rocky shores. Just a couple of kilometres from town, the clifftop Nawab’s Palace is an extraordinary Victorian Gothic-Mughal structure that’s been abandoned for years but would make a perfect heritage hotel. You can peek through its gates (complete with coat of arms) from the roadside for a glimpse of the palace.
Sixteen kilometres north of Murud, Kashid Beach is a beautiful sandy cove where you can take a dip and sip on tender coconuts. It’s a peaceful spot, though expect a smattering of camel-ride-wallahs and banana boats on weekends.
The road continues north, gripping the contours of the exposed shoreline, affording superb oceanic views until you reach the tiny traditional fishing village of Korlai, 31km from Murud. Perched on the rocky headland above the village are the ruined remains of Korlai Fort, which once guarded the giant Kundaliker river estuary and still affords panoramic vistas.
Share autorickshaws (₹100) run as far as Kashid Beach. Cars and bicycles can be hired at the Golden Swan Beach Resort in Murud.
Ganpatipule

The tiny beach resort of Ganpatipule has been luring a steady stream of sea- lovers over the years with its warm waters and wonderful stretches of sand. Located about 375km from Mumbai, it’s a village that snoozes through much of the year, except during holidays such as Diwali or Ganesh Chaturthi. These are times when hordes of boisterous tourists turn up to visit the seaside Ganesha Temple (h6am-9pm) housing a monolithic Ganesh (painted a bright orange).
Activities on and off the beach at Ganpatipule include camel and boat rides (dolphins are sometimes encountered in the morning). Away from a small crowded section near the temple, you’ll find the beach is perfect for a long walk along the sand.

KONKAN SPECIALITIES
Often called Malvani cuisine, this coastal region has many special dishes and snacks you should try.dhondas – cucumber cakes made from cucumber and palm sugar kaju chi aamti – spicy cashew-nut curry kombdi vade – spicy chicken prepared with lime and coconut mori masala – shark curry sol kadhi – pink-coloured, slightly sour digestive made from coconut milk and kokum fruit that accompanies many meals
Malvan
%02365
A government tourism promo parades the emerging Malvan region as comparable to Tahiti, which is a tad ambitious, but it does boast near-white sands, sparkling seas and jungle-fringed backwaters. Offshore there are coral reefs, sea caves and vibrant marine life – diving is becoming a huge draw with the opening of a new world-class diving school.
Malvan town is one of the prettiest on the Konkan Coast. It’s a mellow place with a good stock of old wooden buildings and a busy little harbour and bazaar. Stretching directly south of the centre is lovely Tarkali beach, home to many hotels and guesthouses.
1 Sights & Activities There are several dodgy dive shops operating in Malvan, which allow unqualified diving; if you want to dive, stick with a registered operator.
The southern end of Tarkali beach is bordered by the broad, beautiful Karli river. Several boat operators (you’ll find them moored on the northern bank) offer multi-stop boat trips along this backwater, to Seagull Island, Golden Rock, Dolphin Point and cove beaches. A three-hour trip with a maximum of six people costs ₹1800 per boat.
Sindhudurg Fort
FORT
 
Built by Shivaji and dating from 1664, this monstrous fort lies on an offshore island and can be reached by frequent ferries (9am to 5.30pm, ₹50) from Malvan’s harbour. It’s not as impressive as Janjira up the coast, and today lies mostly in ruins, but it remains a powerful presence. You can explore its rampartsand the coastal views are impressive. Boatmen allow you one hour on the island.
Tarkali Beach
BEACH
 
A golden arc south of Marvan, this crescent-shaped sandy beach is a vision of tropical India, fringed by coconut palms and casuarina trees, plus the odd cow. At dusk (between October and February) fishermen work together to haul in huge, kilometre-long nets that are packed with sardines.

MALVAN NATIONAL MARINE PARK
The shoreline around Malvan is incredibly diverse, with rich wetlands, sandy and rocky beaches, mangroves and river estuaries. But underwater it’s arguably even more compelling, with coral and caves that shelter abundant marine life and extensive forests of sargassum seaweed which acts as a nursery for juvenile fish. Rocky offshore islandsattract schools of snapper and large grouper, butterfly fish, yellow-striped fusilers and lobster. Pods of dolphins are regularly seen between November and February. And the world’s largest fish, the whale shark, even puts in an appearance every now and then.
Presently only a small section is protected as the Malvan National Marine Park, which encompasses the Sindhudurg Fort, yet such is its rich diversity that marine biologists, including IISDA’s director Dr Sarang Kulkarni, feel it’s essential that the boundaries are extended. The reef extends for 16km offshore and has been described as India’s Great Barrier Reef. A submerged plateau, the Angria Bank is 40km long and 20km wide, with healthy coral and an abundance of sealife: nurse sharks are seen on almsot every dive. IISDA has plans to operate day trips and liveaboard excursions to Angria; consult its website for information.
Matheran
%02148 Pop 5750 Elev 803m
Matheran, literally ‘Jungle Above’, is a tiny patch of peace and quiet capping a craggy Sahyadri summit within spitting distance of Mumbai’s heat and grime. Endowed with shady forests criss-crossed with foot trails and breathtaking lookouts, it still retains an elegance and colonial-era ambience, though creeping commercialism and illegal construction are marring its appeal.
Getting to Matheran is really half the fun. While speedier options are available by road, nothing beats arriving in town on the narrow-gauge toy train that chugs up to the heart of the settlement. Motor vehicles are banned within Matheran, making it an ideal place to give your ears and lungs a rest and your feet some exercise.
1 Sights & Activities You can walk along shady forest paths to most of Matheran’s viewpoints in a matter of hours; it’s a place well suited to stress-free ambling. To catch the sunrise, head to Panorama Point, while Porcupine Point (also known as Sunset Point) is the most popular (read: packed) as the sun drops. Louisa Point and Little Chouk Point also have stunning views of theSahyadris.
If you’re here on a weekend or public holiday you might want to avoid the most crowded section around Echo Point, Charlotte Lake and Honeymoon Point, which get rammed with day trippers.
You can reach the valley below One Tree Hill down the path known as Shivaji’s Ladder, supposedly trod upon by the Maratha leader himself.
Horse-wallahs will hustle you constantly for rides (about ₹300 per hour). 4 Sleeping & Eating Hotels in Matheran are generally overpriced and many places have a minimum two-night stay. Checkout times vary wildly (as early as 7am), as do high-and low-season rates. Matheran shuts shop during the monsoons.

TAXI
Buses (₹25) and shared taxis (₹75) run from Neral to Matheran’s Dasturi car park (30 minutes). Horses (₹300) and hand-pulled rickshaws (₹400) wait here to whisk you (relatively speaking) to Matheran’s main bazaar. You can also walkthis stretch in a little under an hour (around 3.5km uphill) and your luggage can be hauled for around ₹220.
TRAIN
The toy train (2nd class/1st class ₹35/225) chugs between Matheran and Neral Junction five times daily. The service is suspended during monsoons.
From Mumbai’s CST station there are two daily express trains to Neral Junction at 7am and 8.40am (2nd class/1st class ₹45/205, 1½ hours). Other expresses from Mumbai stop at Karjat, down the line from Neral, from where you can backtrack on a local train or catch a bus to Matheran (₹30). From Pune, there are at least 13 daily departures to Karjat. Note: trains from Pune don’t stop at Neral Junction.
8 Getting Around Apart from hand-pulled rickshaws and horses, walking is the only other transport option in Matheran.
Lonavla
%02114 Pop 57,400 Elev 625m
Lonavla is an overdeveloped (and overpriced) resort town about 106km southeast of Mumbai. It’s far from attractive, with its main drag consisting almost exclusively of garishly lit shops flogging chikki, the rock-hard, brittle sweet made in the area.
The main reason you’d want to come here is to visit the nearby Karla and Bhaja caves which, after those at Ellora and Ajanta, are the best in Maharashtra.
Hotels, restaurants and the main road to the caves lie north of the train station. Most of the Lonavla township and its markets are located south of the station.

Karla & Bhaja Caves
While they pale in comparison to Ajanta or Ellora, the Karla and Bhaja rock-cut caves, which date from around the 2nd century BC, are among the better examples of Buddhist cave architecture in India. They are also low on commercial tourism, making them ideal places for a quiet excursion. Karla has the most impressive single cave, but Bhaja is a quieter site to explore.
1 Sights
Karla Cave
(Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h9am-5pm)
CAVE
Karla Cave, the largest early chaitya (Buddhist temple) in India, is reached by a 20-minute climb from a mini-bazaar at the base of a hill. Completed in 80 BC, the chaitya is around 40m long and 15m high, and sports a vaulted interior andintricately executed sculptures of Buddha, human and animal figures. Excluding Ellora’s Kailasa Temple, this is probably the most impressive cave temple in the state.
A semicircular ‘sun window’ filters light in towards a dagoba or stupa (the cave’s representation of the Buddha), protected by a carved wooden umbrella, the only remaining example of its kind. The cave’s roof also retains ancient teak buttresses. The 37 pillars forming the aisles are topped by kneeling elephants. The carved elephant heads on the sides of the vestibule once had ivory tusks.
There’s a Hindu temple in front of the cave, thronged by pilgrims whose presence adds colour to the scene.
Bhaja Caves
(Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h9am-6pm)
CAVE
It’s a 3km jaunt from the main road, on the other side of the expressway, to the Bhaja Caves, where the setting is lusher, greener and quieter than at Karla Cave. Thought to date from around 200 BC, 10 of the 18 caves here are viharas (Buddhist monasteries), while Cave 12 is an open chaitya (Buddhist temple), earlier than that at Karla, containing a simple dagoba. Beyond this is a strange huddle of 14 stupas, five inside and nine outside a smaller cave.

It’s much more peaceful during the week. There’s a wide choice of rooms and cottages, from economy to smart, and a good restaurant.
8 Getting There & Around Karla is 11km east of Lonavla, and Bhaja 9km. Both can be visited on a local bus (₹16, 30 minutes) to the access point, from where it’s about a 6km return walk on eachside to the two sites. But that would be exhausting and hot. Autorickshaws charge around ₹500 from Lonavla for the tour, including waiting time.
Pune
%020 Pop 5.14 million Elev 535m
A thriving, vibrant metropolis, Pune is a centre of academia and business that epitomises ‘New India’ with its baffling mix of capitalism, spiritualism, ancient and modern. It’s also globally famous, or notorious, for an ashram, the Osho International Meditation Resort, founded by the late guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.
Pune was initially given pride of place by Shivaji and the ruling Peshwas, who made it their capital. The British took the city in 1817 and, thanks to its cool and dry climate, soon made it the Bombay Presidency’s monsoon capital. Globalisation knocked on Pune’s doors in the 1990s, following which it went in for an image overhaul. However, some colonial-era charm was retained in a few old buildings and residential areas, bringing about a pleasant coexistence of the old and new, which (despite the pollution and hectic traffic) makes Pune a worthwhile place to explore.
In August/September Ganesh Chaturthi brings on a tide of festivities across the city, and provides a fantastic window for exploring the city’s cultural side. On a more sombre note, the fatal 2010 terrorist attack on the German Bakery, a once favourite haunt for travellers and ashramites alike, remains a painful memory in this peace-loving city.
The city sits at the confluence of the Mutha and Mula Rivers. Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Rd, about 1km south of Pune train station, is the main commercial street. The leafy upmarket suburb of Koregaon Park, northeast of the train station, is home to numerous hotels, restaurants, coffee shops and, of course, the Osho ashram.Pune

 ; %66019999; www.osho.com; 17 Koregaon Park)
Indelibly linked with Pune’s identity, this iconic ashram-resort, located in a leafy, upscale northern suburb, has been drawing thousands of sanyasins (seekers) since the death of Osho in 1990. With its swimming pool, sauna and spa, ‘zennis’ and boutique guesthouse, it is, to some, the ultimate place to indulge in some luxe meditation. Alternately, detractors point fingers at the blatant commercialisation and high cost and accuse it of marketing a warped version of the mystic East to rich, gullible Westerners.
To make up your own mind you’ll have to cough up the (steep) registration and daily meditation fees. Tours of the facilities are no longer permitted – the only way to access Osho is to pay an initial ₹1400, which covers registration (passport required) and a mandatory on-the-spot HIV test (sterile needles used). You’ll also need two robes (one maroon and one white, ₹500 to ₹700 per robe) and attend a welcome session (daily at 9am). Note that the rules and regulations are very strict, even pedantic: swimmers are only allowed to wear, and have to pay for, (Osho maroon) swimwear and there are mandatory (Osho maroon) clothes for the gym. Indian nationals are also lectured about behaviour (eg not hassling foreign women) in special etiquette classes.
Once you’ve got all this out of the way, you can then pay for a meditation pass (₹760/1560 per day Indian/foreigner, with discounts for longer stays). Oh, that’s apart from the fee to enter the Basho Spa (where the pool, Jacuzzi, gym, saunas and tennis courts are all located), which will be a further ₹280.
The main centre for meditation and the nightly white-robed spiritual dance is the Osho Auditorium (no coughing or sneezing, please). The Osho Samadhi, where the guru’s ashes are kept, is also open for meditation. The commune’s ‘Multiversity’ runs a plethora of courses in meditation and other esoteric techniques.
In the evenings, as well as meditation sessions, there’s a ‘nightlife’ program, with parties, cinema and theatre and ‘creativity nights’.
Photography is not permitted anywhere in the ashram.

OSHO: GURU OF SEX
Ever tried mixing spirituality with primal instincts, and garnishing with oodles of expensive trinkets? Well, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (1931–90) certainly did. Osho, as he preferred to be called, was one of India’s most flamboyant ‘export gurus’ to market the mystic East to the world, and undoubtedly the most controversial.
Initially based in Pune, he followed no particular religion or philosophy, and outraged many across the world with his advocacy of sex as a path to enlightenment. A darling of the international media, he quickly earned himself the epithet ‘sex guru’. In 1981, Rajneesh took his curious blend of Californian pop psychology and Indian mysticism to the USA, where he set up an agricultural commune in Oregon. There, his ashram’s notoriety, as well as its fleet of (material and thus valueless!) Rolls-Royces grew, until raging local opposition following a bizarre, infamous food poisoning incident (designed to manipulate local elections) moved the authorities to charge Osho with immigration fraud. He was fined US$400,000 and deported.
An epic journey then began, during which Osho and his followers, in their search for a new base, were either deported from or denied entry into 21 countries. By 1987, he was back at his Pune ashram, where thousands of foreigners soon flocked for his nightly discourses and meditation sessions.
They still come from across the globe. Such is the demand for the resort’s facilities that prices are continually on the rise, with luxury being redefined every day. Interestingly, despite Osho’s comments on how nobody should be poor, no money generated by the resort goes into helping the disadvantaged.
In recent years the Osho institute has embraced the digital age, with its online iOsho portal offering iMeditate programs, Osho radio and Osho library; subscriptions are required.

Set around a manicured lawn right next to the Osho Resort, this renovated art deco bungalow effortlessly combines colonial-era class with boutique appeal. Deluxe rooms in the main building sport antique furniture, while even the cheapest options are beautifully presented (though lack a private bathroom). The priciest rooms are across the lawns, in a sleek, glass-fronted building.
An additional draw is the in-house fine-dining restaurant, Dario’s.

Pune train station (sometimes called Pune Junction) is in the heart of the city, on HH Prince Aga Khan Rd. There are very regular, roughly hourly, services to Mumbai, and good links to cities including Delhi, Chennai and Hyderabad.8 Getting Around The modern airport is 8km northeast of the city. From the centre of town, an autorickshaw costs about ₹120 and a taxi ₹280.
Autorickshaws can be found everywhere; a trip from the train station to Koregaon Park costs about ₹40 (more at night).
MAHABALESHWAR
Once a summer capital under the British, today the hill station of Mahabaleshwar (1327m) is an overdeveloped mess, tainted by an ugly building boom and traffic chaos as tourists attempt a mad dash to tick off its viewpoints. There’s no massive reason to visit, though the town can be used as a base to visit the impressive Pratapgad fort (p000) an hour or so away. Don’t even consider dropping by during the monsoon when the whole town virtually shuts down (and a staggering 6m of rain falls).
From Mahabaleshwar bus stand, state buses leave roughly hourly for Pune (semideluxe ₹240, 3 ½ hours). Luxury buses can be booked via agents in the bazaar for Goa (₹1300 to ₹1780, 12 hours, some with a changeover in Surur); Mumbai (₹525 to ₹800, 7 ½ hours) and Pune (₹630 to ₹790, 3 ½ hours).
For the Pratapgad fort, a state bus (₹130 return, one hour, 9.15am) does a daily round- trip, with a waiting time of around one hour; taxi drivers charge a fixed ₹1000 return, including two hours’ waiting time.
Around PuneSinhagad
Sinhagad
RUIN
(Lion Fort; hdawn-dusk)F
The ruined Sinhagad, about 24km southwest of Pune, was wrested by Maratha leader Shivaji from the Bijapur kings in 1670. In the epic battle (where he lost his son Sambhaji), Shivaji is said to have used monitor lizards yoked with ropes to scale the fort’s craggy walls. Today, it’s in a poor state, but worth visiting for the sweeping views and opportunity to hike in the hills.
From Sinhagad village, shared 4WDs (₹50) can cart you 10km to the base of the summit. Bus 50 runs frequently to Sinhagad village from Swargate (₹27, 45 minutes).
Shivneri
Situated 90km northwest of Pune, above the village of Junnar, Shivneri Fort (hdawn-dusk) holds the distinction of being the birthplace of Shivaji. Within the ramparts of this ruined fort are the old royal stables, a mosque dating back to the Mughal era and several rock-cut reservoirs. The most important structure is Shivkunj, the pavilion in which Shivaji was born.
About 4km from Shivneri, on the other side of Junnar, is an interesting group
of Hinayana Buddhist caves called Lenyadri (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; hdawn-dusk).
Of the 30-odd caves, cave 7 is the most impressive, and interestingly houses an image of the Hindu god Ganesh.
Hourly buses (₹85, two hours) connect Pune’s Shivaji Nagar terminus with Junnar from 6.30am. A day cab from Pune will cost about ₹2600.
WORTH A TRIP
PRATAPGAD FORT
The spectacular Pratapgad Fort (Indian/foreigner ₹10/100; h9am-dusk), built by Shivaji in 1656 (and still owned by his descendents), straddles a high mountain ridge 24km northwest of the town of Mahabaleshwar. In 1659, Shivaji agreed to meet Bijapuri general Afzal Khan here, in an attempt to end a stalemate. Despite a no-arms agreement, Shivaji,upon greeting Khan, disembowelled his enemy with a set of iron baghnakh (tiger’s claws). Khan’s tomb (out of bounds) marks the site of this painful encounter at the base of the fort.
Pratapgad is reached by a 500-step climb that affords brilliant views. For ₹200 a guide will take you to 20 points of interest, taking nearly two hours.
From the bus stand in Mahabaleshwar, 120km south of Pune, a state bus (₹130 return, one hour, 9.15am) does a daily shuttle to the fort, with a waiting time of around one hour. Taxi drivers in Mahabaleshwar charge a fixed ₹1000 for the return trip, including two hours’ waiting time.
Kolhapur
%0231 Pop 561,300 Elev 550m
A little-visited city, Kolhapur is the perfect place to get intimate with the flamboyant side of India. Only a few hours from Goa, this historic settlement boasts an intensely fascinating temple complex. In August, Kolhapur is at its vibrant best, when Naag Panchami (hJul/Aug), a snake-worshipping festival, is held in tandem with one at Pune. Gastronomes take note: the town is also the birthplace of the famed, spicy Kolhapuri cuisine, especially chicken and mutton dishes.
The old town around the Mahalaxmi Temple is 3km southwest of the bus and train stations, while the ‘new’ palace is a similar distance to the north. Rankala Lake, a popular spot for evening strolls, is 5km southwest of the stations.

o Shree Chhatrapati Shahu Museum
(Indian/foreigner ₹20/75 incl coffee; h9.30am-5.30pm)
MUSEUM
‘Bizarre’ takes on a whole new meaning at this ‘new’ palace, an Indo-Saracenic behemoth designed by British architect ‘Mad’ Charles Mant for the Kolhapur kings in 1884. The madcap museum features countless trophies from the kings’ trigger-happy jungle safaris, including walking sticks made from leopard vertebrae and ashtrays fashioned out of tiger skulls and rhino feet. The armoury houses enough weapons to stage a mini-coup. The horror-house effect is brought full circle by the taxidermy section.
Don’t miss the highly ornate Durbar Hall, where the rulers held court sessions, and dotted around the palace you’ll find dozens of portraits of the portly maharajas to admire. Photography is prohibited inside. There’s a little cafe by the entrance for snacks (and where foreigners may claim their complimentary coffee).
A rickshaw from the train station will cost ₹35.
Old Palace
(Old Town)
HISTORIC BUILDING
In the heart of the old town this palace was once the ruling Chatrapati’s main residence, and is still occupied by some in the family. You can enter the building’s front courtyard but there’s little to see today except a temple dedicated to the deity Bhavani Mata.
Motibag Thalim
COURTYARD
 
Kolhapur is famed for the calibre of its Kushti wrestlers, and at the Motibag Thalim, young athletes train in an earthen pit. The akhara (training ground) is reached through a low doorway and passage beside the entrance to Bhavani Mandap (ask for directions). You are free to walk in and watch, as long as youdon’t mind the sight of sweaty, semi-naked men and the stench of urine emanating from the loos.

Why Go?
Goa is like no other state in India. It could be the Portuguese colonial influence, the endless beaches, the glorious whitewashed churches or the relaxed culture of susegad – a uniquely Goan term that translates as ‘laid-backness’ and is evident in all aspects of daily life and in the Goan people themselves.
But Goa is far more than its old-school reputation as a hippie haven or its contemporary status as a beach getaway. Goa is as naturally and culturally rich as it is compact; you can go birdwatching in a butterfly-filled forest, marvel at centuries-old cathedrals, trek out to milky waterfalls and aromatic spice farms or meander the capital’s charming alleyways. Add a dash of Portuguese-influenced food and architecture, infuse with a colourful blend of religious traditions, pepper with parties and beach shacks, and you’ve got a recipe that makes Goa easy to enjoy and extremely hard to leave.
When to GoA Sep–Nov Post-monsoon, some shacks are up but crowds are still down; accommodation bargains.
A Dec–Feb Festivals, Christmas spirit and great weather; peak prices and crowds from mid-Dec to early Jan.
A Mar & Apr Carnival and Easter celebrations as the season winds down.

History
Goa went through a dizzying array of rulers from Ashoka’s Mauryan empire in the 3rd century BC to the long-ruling Kadambas. Subsequent conflict saw the Muslim Delhi sultanate and then Bahmani sultanate fighting the Hindu Vijayanagar empire for control; these were violent times, and in addition to many deaths, lots of Hindu temples were razed. The Adil Shahs of Bijapur created the capital we now call Old Goa in the 15th century.
The Portuguese arrived in 1510, seeking control of the region’s lucrative spice routes. They defeated the Bijapur kings and steadily pushed their power from their grand capital at Old Goa out into the provinces. Portuguese rule and religion spread throughout the state – sometimes by force – and the Goan Inquisition brought repression and brutality in the name of Christianity. The Portuguese resisted India's 1947 Independence from Britain but in 1961, after almost a decade in talks to encourage the Portuguese to withdraw, the Indian Army marched in and took Goa by force within three days – virtually without a fight – ending almost five centuries of Portuguese occupation.
Today Goa enjoys one of India’s highest per-capita incomes and comparatively high health and literacy rates, with tourism, iron-ore miningcomparatively high health and literacy rates, with tourism, iron-ore mining (though this is mired in controversy and was suspended by the High Court from 2013–14), agriculture and fishing forming the basis of its economy. The legacy of the Portuguese can still be found almost everywhere, in the state’s scores of old mansions, its cuisine, churches and even in its language.

2 Activities In season Goa has a whole host of options for yoga and alternative therapies, water sports, paragliding, cooking classes and wildlife-watching.
Yoga & Alternative Therapies
Every imaginable form of yoga, meditation, reiki, ayurvedic massage and other spiritually orientated health regime is practised, taught and relished in Goa, though they usually operate only in the winter season (October or November to April). Palolem and Patnem, in the south of the state, and Arambol, Mandrem, Anjuna, Assagao and Calangute in the north all offer courses and have reputable yoga retreats.
Wildlife-WatchingGoa is a nature lover’s paradise, with an abundance of brilliant birdlife and a fine (but well concealed) collection of fauna, including barking deer and the odd leopard in several inland sanctuaries. Day Tripper in Calangute offers various nature-related tours, while John’s Boat Tours in Candolim runs birdwatching boat trips, along with crocodile-and dolphin-spotting rides.
Jungle Book (%9822121431; www.goaecotourism.com; Bazar Wada, Colem; elephant
rides/wash from ₹700), in Colem, is the place to commune with elephants.
Water Sports
Parasailing, jet-skiing and boat trips are readily available on main beaches. Palolem, with its relatively calm waters, is the best place for kayaking. Goa's tame surf is good for beginners: surfing outfits include Vaayu Waterman's Village at Aswem Beach, Surf Wala at Arambol and Banana Surf School
(%7057998120; www.goasurf.com; Utorda Beach; lessons €45-250; h7.30am-12.30pm Oct-Mar) at
Utorda.
Goa has four scuba diving outfits where you can gain PADI certification and go on dive trips to Grande Island and further afield. Goa Aquatics, Barracuda

8 Information The Goa Tourism Development Corporation provides maps and information, operates hotels throughout the state and runs a host of one-day and multiday tours.
EMERGENCIES
Dialling 108 will connect you to the police, fire brigade or medical services.
8 Getting There & Away
AIR
Goa’s only airport, Dabolim, is served directly by domestic flights, a handful of international flights from the Middle East; and seasonal package-holidaycharters, mostly from Russia, Europe and Britain.
Unless you're on a charter you'll generally have to fly in to a major Indian city and change to a domestic flight with Jet Airways, Air India, SpiceJet or IndiGo.
BUS
Plenty of long-distance interstate buses – both state-run and private – operate to and from Panaji, Margao, Mapusa and Chaudi, near Palolem. Fares for private operators are only slightly higher than for Kadamba government buses, and they fluctuate throughout the year. Long-distance buses may be standard, air- conditioned (AC), Volvo (the most comfortable seater buses) and sleeper. For fares, timetables and online booking see www.goakadamba.com.
TRAIN
The Konkan Railway, the main train line running through Goa, connects Mumbai and Mangalore, though the rail line continues all the way south to Trivandrum. The biggest station in Goa is Margao’s Madgaon station. See the Margao section for useful trains. Other smaller stations on the line include Pernem for Arambol, Thivim for Mapusa and the northern beaches, Karmali (Old Goa) for Panaji, and Canacona for Palolem.
8 Getting Around
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
Dabolim’s prepaid taxi counter in the arrivals hall makes arriving easy; buy your ticket here and you’ll be ushered to a cab. Real budgeteers without much luggage can try walking out to the main road and waving down one of the frequent buses heading east from Vasco da Gama to Margao and catch onward transport from there.
BUS
Goa's extensive network of local buses run frequently and fares range from ₹5 to ₹40. Travelling between north, central and south Goa you'll need to change buses at either Panaji or Margao.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
It’s easy in Goa to organise a private car with a driver for long-distance daytrips. Expect to pay from ₹2000 for a full day out on the road (usually defined as eight hours and 80km). It’s also possible, if you have the nerves and the need to feel independent, to procure a self-drive car. A small Maruti will cost from ₹900 to ₹1200 per day and a large jeep around ₹2000, excluding petrol and usually with a kilometre limit. Your best bet for rental is online at sites such as
www.goa2u.com and www.mygoatour.com.
You’ll rarely go far on a Goan road without seeing a tourist whizzing by on a scooter or motorbike, and renting one is a breeze. You’ll likely pay from ₹200 to ₹300 per day for a scooter, ₹400 for a smaller Yamaha motorbike, and ₹500 for a Royal Enfield Bullet. These prices can drop considerably if you’re renting for more than a few days or if it’s an off-peak period – it's all supply and demand, so bargain if there are lots of machines around.
Bear in mind that Goan roads – while better than many Indian roads – can be tricky, filled with human, bovine, canine, feline, mechanical and avian obstacles, as well as potholes, speed-breakers and hairpin bends. Take it slowly, avoid riding at night (when black cows and drunk tourists can prove dangerous), don’t attempt a north–south day trip on a 50cc scooter, and ask for a helmet – in theory, compulsory, though the law is still routinely ignored by Goans and tourists alike.
TAXI & AUTORICKSHAW
Taxis are widely available for town-hopping, but the local union cartel means prices are high, especially at night. A new initiative by Goa Tourism is the Women Taxi Service (%0832-2437437), with female drivers, phone-only bookings and only females, couples or families accepted as passengers. The vehicles are fitted with GPS monitoring, martial-arts trained female drivers and accurate meters. Fares can even by paid with a credit card.
Unlike elsewhere in India, autorickshaws are not much cheaper than taxis and are not as common, but they're still good for short trips if you can find one. Motorcycle taxis, known as ‘pilots’, are also a licensed form of taxi in Goa, identified by a yellow front mudguard. They're only really common around major taxi stands and beach resorts and cost half the price of a taxi.
DRUGSAcid, ecstasy, cocaine, charas (hashish), marijuana and most other forms of drugs are illegal in India (though still available in Goa), and purchasing or carrying drugs is fraught with danger. Goa’s Fort Aguada jail is filled with prisoners, including some foreigners, serving lengthy sentences for drug offences. Being caught in possession of even a small quantity of illegal substances can mean a 10-year stretch.
CENTRAL GOA
Panaji (Panjim)
Pop 115,000
One of India's most relaxed state capitals, Panaji (Panjim) overlooks the mouth of the broad Mandovi River, where party boats and floating casinos cast neon reflections in the night. A glorious whitewashed church lords over the city centre, a broad tree-lined boulevard skirts the river and grand colonial-era buildings rub shoulders with arty boutiques, old-school bookshops and backstreet bars.
But it's the tangle of narrow streets in the old quarter of Fontainhas that really steal the show. Nowhere is the Portuguese influence felt more strongly than here, where the late afternoon sun lights up yellow houses with purple doors, and around each corner you'll find crumbling ochre-coloured mansions with wrought-iron balconies, terracotta-tiled roofs and oyster-shell windows. Panjim is a place for walking, enjoying the peace of the afternoon siesta, eating well and meeting real Goans. A day or two in the capital really is an essential part of your Goan experience.Panaji (Panjim)

1 Sights & Activities One of the pleasures of Panaji is long, leisurely strolls through the sleepy Portuguese-era Sao Tomé, Fontainhas and Altinho districts.

Panaji’s spiritual, as well as geographical, centre is this elevated, pearly white church, built in 1619 over an older, smaller 1540 chapel and stacked like a fancy white wedding cake. When Panaji was little more than a sleepy fishing village, this church was the first port of call for sailors from Lisbon, who would give thanks for a safe crossing, before continuing to Ela (Old Goa) further east up the river. The church is beautifully illuminated at night.

Interesting displays onbuilding practices and European and local design will change the way you see those old Goan homes. The triangular building is an architectural oddity in itself, and the museum traces Goan architectural traditions, building materials and styles in an indepth but accessible style. From Panaji, a taxi or rickshaw will cost you about ₹400 one-way.
T Tours Goa Tourism and several private companies offer cruises on the Mandovi River from Santa Monica Jetty. With bars and DJs playing loud music, these can get rowdy on weekends but are an entertaining perspective on the capital.
Heritage walking tours (%9823025748; per person ₹500, per person for five or more

ACCOMMODATION
Accommodation price ranges used in this chapter are as follows: $ below ₹1200
$$ ₹1200 to ₹5000
$$$ above ₹5000
Accommodation prices in Goa vary considerably depending on the season and demand. High-season prices run from November to late February, but prices climb higher to a peak rate during the crowded Christmas and New Year period (around 22 December to 3 January). Mid-season is October and March to April, and low season is the monsoon (May to September). These seasonal dates can vary a little depending on the monsoon and the granting of shack licences, which are renewed every couple of years.
Throughout Goa's coastal belt there are private rooms and whole houses to let, generally for stays of a week or more.All accommodation rates listed are for the high season – but not the peak Christmas period, when you'll almost certainly have to book ahead anyway. Always call ahead for rates and ask about discounts. Most accommodation places have an 11am or noon checkout.

GOAN CUISINE
Goan cuisine is a tantalising fusion of Portuguese and South Indian flavours. Goans tend to be hearty meat and fish eaters, and fresh seafood is a staple: the quintessential Goan lunch of ‘fish-curry-rice’ is fried mackerel steeped in coconut, tamarind and chilli sauce. Traditional dishes include vindaloo (a fiery dish in a marinade of vinegar and garlic), xacuti (a spicy chicken or meat dish cooked in red coconut sauce) and cafreal (dry-fried chicken marinated in a green masala paste and sprinkled with toddy vinegar). For dessert try the layered bebinca cake.
The traditional Goan drink is feni, a double-distilled fiery liquour made from the cashew fruit or palm toddy.
6 Drinking & Nightlife Panaji’s simple little bars with a few plastic tables and chairs are a great way to get chattingwith locals over a glass of feni (Goan liquor distilled from coconut milk or cashews).

Old Goa
From the 16th to the 18th centuries, when Old Goa’s population exceeded that of Lisbon or London, Goa's former capital was considered the ‘Rome of the East’. You can still sense that grandeur as you wander what's left of the city, with its towering churches and cathedrals and majestic convents. Its rise under the Portuguese, from 1510, was meteoric, but cholera and malaria outbreaks forced the abandonment of the city in the 1600s. In 1843 the capital was officially shifted to Panaji.
Some of the most imposing churches and cathedrals are still in use and are remarkably well preserved, while other historical buildings have become museums or ruined sites. It’s a fascinating day trip, but it can get crowded: consider visiting on a weekday morning, when you can take in Mass at Sé Cathedral or the Basilica of Bom Jesus (remember to cover shoulders and legs in the churches; no beachwear).
The major event of the year is the 10 day Novena leading up to the Feast of St Francis Xavier on 3 December. Once every decade on this date, the Expositionsees the casket containing St Francis' body carried through Old Goa’s streets; the next one is 2024.

Famous throughout the Roman Catholic world, the imposing Basilica of Bom Jesus contains the tomb and mortal remains of St Francis Xavier, the so-called Apostle of the Indies. St Francis Xavier’s missionary voyages throughout the East became legendary. His ‘incorrupt’ body is in the mausoleum to the right, in a glass-sided coffin amid a shower of gilt stars.
Construction on the basilica began in 1594 and was completed in 1605, to create an elaborate late-Renaissance structure, fronted by a facade combining elements of Doric, Ionic and Corinthian design.

At over 76m long and 55m wide, the cavenerous Sé Cathedral is the largest church in Asia. Building work commenced in 1562, on the orders of King Dom Sebastiao of Portugal, and the finishing touches where finally made some 90 years later. The exterior of the cathedral is notable for its plain style, in the Tuscan tradition. Also of note is its rather lopsided look resulting from the loss of one of its bell towers, which collapsed in 1776 after being struck by lightning. The remaining tower houses the famous Sino de Ouro (Golden Bell), the largest in Asia and renowned for its rich tone, which once tolled to accompany the Inquisition’s notoriously cruel autos-da-fé (trials of faith), held out the front of the cathedral on what was then the market square.
Church of St Francis of Assisi

West of the Sé Cathedral, the Church of St Francis of Assisi is no longer in use for worship, and consequently exudes a more mournful air than its neighbours.
The church started life as a small chapel, built on this site by eight Franciscanfriars on their arrival in 1517. In 1521 it was replaced by a church consecrated to the Holy Ghost, which was then subsequently rebuilt in 1661, with only the doorway of the old building incorporated into the new structure. This original doorway, in ornate Manueline style, contrasts strongly with the rest of the facade, the plainness of which had become the fashion by the 17th century.

This excellent museum, in a stunningly restored space within the 1627 Convent of St Monica, contains a collection of statues, paintings and sculptures, though the setting warrants a visit in its own right. Interestingly, many of the works of Goan Christian art made during the Portuguese era, including some of those on display here, were produced by local Hindu artists.

Modelled on the original design of St Peter's in Rome, the Church of St Cajetan was built by Italian friars of the Order of Theatines, who were sent by Pope Urban III to preach Christianity in the kingdom of Golconda (near Hyderabad). The friars were not permitted to work in Golconda, so settled at Old Goa in 1640. The construction of the church began in 1655.
Church of Our Lady of the Mount

This church is often overlooked due to its location on a wooded hilltop, some 2km east of the central area. A sealed road leads to an overgrown flight of steps (don’t walk it solo) and the hill on which the church stands commands an excellent view of Old Goa, with the church spires seemingly rising out a sea of palms.

BACKWOODS CAMP
In a forest near Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary, full of butterflies and birds, Backwoods Camp (%9822139859; www.backwoodsgoa.com; Matkan, Tambdi Surla; 1-/2-/3-day
₹4500/7500/11,000) is a magical, serene spot. The resort is about 1km from Tambdi Surla temple in the state's far east, and for birdwatching enthusiasts it offers one of Goa’s richest sources birding, with everything from Ceylon frogmouths and Asian fairy bluebirds to puff-throated babblers and Indian pittas putting in a regular appearance. Accommodation is in comfortable tents on raised platforms, bungalows and farmhouse rooms. Rates include three guided birdwatching walks daily.
8 Getting There & Away Frequent buses to Old Goa depart from Panaji’s Kadamba bus stand (₹10, 25 minutes).
Ponda & Around
The workaday inland town of Ponda, 29km southeast of Panaji, has two big drawcards in the vicinity – Goa's best Hindu temple complexes and spice plantations – and is well worth a day away from the beach. Temple aficionados, however, might be a little disappointed; most were built or rebuilt after the originals were destroyed by the Portuguese, so they’re not as ancient as thoseg
elsewhere in India.
yy               g,y
The 18th-century hilltop Mangueshi Temple at Priol, 5km northwest of Ponda, is dedicated to Manguesh, a god known only in Goa, while 1km away at Mardol is the Mahalsa Temple, also dedicated to a specifically Goan deity. The 1738 Shantadurga Temple, meanwhile, just west of Ponda, is dedicated to Shantadurga, the goddess of peace, and is one of the most famous shrines in Goa.
There are regular buses to Ponda from Panaji (₹20, 1½ hours) and Margao (₹18, one hour), after which you’ll need to arrange a taxi to visit the temples or spice farms. Taxis from Panaji charge ₹1500 for a day trip to the area (up to eight hours and 80km).
WORTH A TRIP
SPICE UP YOUR LIFE
The Ponda region is the centre of commercial spice farms, producing vanilla, pepper, cardamom, nutmeg, chilli and tumeric, along with crops such as cashew, betel nut, coconut, pineapple and papaya. Farms offer a guided tour of the plantation, buffet thali- style lunch, and in some cases elephant rides and cultural shows.

Mapusa
Pop 40,100
The pleasantly bustling market town of Mapusa (pronounced ‘Mapsa’) is the largest in northern Goa and a transport hub for local and interstate buses. The main reason for travellers to visit is for the busy Mapusa Market (

 ; h8am-6.30pm Mon-Sat), which attracts scores of buyers and sellers
from neighbouring towns and villages. It’s a good place to pick up the usual embroidered bedsheets and the like at prices lower than in the beach resorts. The market operates daily, but Friday is the biggest day.
Mapusa is also home to the rewarding little Other India Bookstore (

8 Getting There & Away If you’re coming to Goa by bus from Mumbai, Mapusa’s Kadamba bus stand (%2232161) is the jumping-off point for the northern beaches. Local services run every few minutes; for buses to the southern beaches, take a bus to Panaji, then Margao, and change there.
Local services include the following:
A Anjuna (₹15, 20 minutes) A Arambol (₹27, 1½ hours)
A Calangute/Candolim (₹10/12, 20/35 minutes) A Panjim (₹15, 20 minutes) A Thivim (₹15, 20 minutes) Interstate services run out of the same lot, but private operators have their offices next to the bus stand. There’s generally little difference in price between private services and the Kadamba buses, but shop around as there are various standards of bus.
Long-distance services include the following: A Bengaluru (private; AC or sleeper ₹1400, 13-14hr) A Mumbai (private; non-AC ₹700, AC ₹1200, 12- 15hr) A Pune (private; non-AC from ₹650, AC ₹1200, sleeper ₹1000, 11-13hr) There’s a prepaid taxi stand outside the bus terminal where you can catch taxis to Anjuna (₹300), Calangute (₹300), Arambol (₹500) and Panaji (₹500); autorickshaws typically charge ₹50 less than taxis.
A Thivim, about 12km northeast of town, is the nearest train station on the Konkan Railway. Local buses meet trains; an autorickshaw into Mapusa from Thivim costs around ₹200.
GREEN GOA
Goa’s environment has suffered from an onslaught of tourism over the last 40 years, but also from the effects of logging, mining and local customs (rare turtle eggs have traditionally been considered a delicacy). Construction proceeds regardless of what the local infrastructure or ecosystem can sustain, while plastic bottles pile up in vast mountains. There are, however, a few easy ways to minimise your impact on Goa’s environment: Take your own bag when shopping and refill water bottles with filtered
th
iblwater wherever possible.
Rent a bicycle instead of a scooter, for short trips at least; bicycle rentals are declining as a result of our scooter infatuation and the bikes are poor quality, but they’ll bounce back if the demand is there.
Goa Tourism now employs cleaners to comb the beaches each morning picking up litter, but do your part by disposing of cigarette butts, litter and plastic bottles.
Turtles are protected by the Forest Department ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ;
www.forest.goa.gov.in), which operates information huts on beaches such as Agonda, Galgibag and Morjim, where turtles arrive to lay eggs. Also doing good work over many
years is the Goa Foundation (

Britto’s Apts, G-8 Feira Alta, Mapusa), the state’s main environmental pressure group based in Mapusa. It has spearheaded a number of conservation projects since its inauguration in 1986, including pressure to stop illegal mining, and its website is a great place to learn more about Goan environmental issues. The group’s excellent Fish Curry & Rice (₹600), a sourcebook on Goa’s environment and lifestyle, is sold at Mapusa’s Other India Bookstore. The Foundation occasionally runs volunteer projects.

Candolim’s long and languid beach, which curves round as far as smaller Sinquerim beach in the south, is largely the preserve of mature, slow-roasting tourists from the UK, Russia and Scandinavia (and elsewhere in India), and is fringed with seasonal beach shacks, all offering sun beds and shade in exchange for your custom.
Back from the beach, busy Fort Aguada Rd is among one of the best resort strips in Goa for shops and services, and is home to dozens of restaurants, bars and hotels, but it lacks the personality of many other beach towns and independent travellers might find it a bit soulless.

If you’re desperately missing Edam cheese or Pot Noodles, or just want to do some self-catering, Newton’s is Goa’s biggest supermarket. There’s a good line in toiletries, wines, children’s toys and luxury food items. The downside is that it’s usually packed and security guards won’t allow bags inside.
8 Getting There & Away Buses run frequently to Panaji (₹15, 35 minutes) and Mapusa (₹12, 35 minutes) and stop at the turn-off near John’s Boat Tours. Calangute buses (₹5, 15 minutes) start at the Fort Aguada bus stop and can be flagged down on Fort Aguada Rd.
Calangute & Baga
Pop 15,800
Love it or loathe it, Calangute and Baga are Goa's most popular beaches – at least with the cashed-up domestic tour crowd and European package tourists. Once a refuge of wealthy Goans, and later a 1960s hot spot for naked, revelling hippies, Calangute has adapted its scant charms to extended Indian families, groups of Indian bachelors and partying foreigners. This is Goa's most crowded beach stretch – from the traffic-clogged streets to the Arabian Sea, which fills up with people, boats and jet skis – though the southern beach is more relaxed. Baga, to the north, is notorious for drinking and dancing, while Northern Baga, across the Baga River, is surprisingly tranquil, with a few budget guesthouses and top-notch restaurants.Calangute & Baga

In the heart of Calangute’s busy market area, 1st-floor Plantain Leaf has consistently been the area’s best veg restaurant for many years. It’s gone through a change though, dumping the classic South Indian banana leaf thalis, adding nonveg (meat) to the menu and expanding its repertoire to more North Indian flavours. It’s still a good place for a thali, along with seafood (fish thali ₹150), kebabs and biriyani, and just sneaks in to the budget category.

Taxis charge an extortionate ₹100 between Calangute and Baga. A prepaid taxi from Dabolim Airport to Calangute costs ₹750.Anjuna
Good old Anjuna. The stalwart of India’s hippy scene still drags out the sarongs and sandalwood each Wednesday for its famous – and once infamous – flea market. With its raggedy beach, rice paddies and cheap guesthouses huddled in relatively peaceful pockets, it continues to pull in backpackers and long-term hippies, while midrange tourists are also increasingly making their way here. The village itself might be a bit frayed around the edges – if your only introduction is the tatty cliff-tops around the bus stand you may be unimpressed. But look further afield and you may come to appreciate Anjuna's haphazard charm, and see why it remains a favourite of both long-stayers and first-timers.Anjuna

ANJUNA'S FLEA MARKET EXPERIENCE
Anjuna's Wednesday flea market ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ; h8am-late Wed, Nov-late Mar)
is as much part of the Goan experience as a day on the beach. More than three decades ago it was the sole preserve of hippies smoking jumbo joints and convening to compare experiences on the heady Indian circuit. Nowadays, things are far more mainstream with stalls carrying crafts from Kashmir and Karnataka, mirrored textiles from Rajasthan, spices from Kerala and Tibetan trinkets. There are a couple of bars with live music and cold beer.
The market is still good fun and shows no sign of waning in popularity, so dive in and enjoy the ride. The best time to visit is early (from 8am) or late afternoon (around 4pm till close just after sunset).5 Eating & Drinking The southern end of Anjuna beach boasts a string of super-sized semipermanent beach shacks serving all day food and drinks and partying late into the night – good ones include Cafe Lilliput, Curlies,

There’s a parachute silk-covered rooftop lounge bar and an enclosed late-night dance club. Thursday and Saturday are big nights, as are full moon nights.
WHERE’S THE PARTY?
Though Goa was long legendary among Western visitors for its all-night, open-air Goan trance parties, a central government ‘noise pollution’ ban on loud music in open spaces between 10pm and 6am has largely curbed its often notorious, drug-laden party scene, though late nights are allowed in sound-proof interior spaces. If you’re looking for the remainder of the real party scene, though, you’ll need to keep your ear close to the ground, and wait out for word in Vagator or Anjuna. Authorities tend to turn a blind eye to parties during the peak Christmas–New Year period.
8 Information Anjuna has three ATMs, clustered together on the main road to the beach, and another down near the bus stand. Free wi-fi is common in guesthouses and cafes.
8 Getting There & Away Buses to Mapusa (₹15) depart every half-
hour or so from the main bus stand ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) near the beach;
some from Mapusa continue on to Vagator and Chapora. Two daily buses to Calangute depart from the main crossroads. Taxis and autos gather at both stops, and you can hire scooters and motorcycles easily from the crossroads.
Vagator & Chapora
Vagator's twin beaches are small by Goan standards but the dramatic red-stone cliffs, rolling green hills, patches of forest and a crumbling 17th-century
Portuguese fort (

 ) provide Vagator and its diminutive
neighbour Chapora with one of the prettiest settings on the north Goan coast. Once known for wild trance parties and heady, hippy lifestyle, Vagator hasslowed down, but it's still the place of choice for many backpackers and partygoers, and tiny Chapora – reminiscent of Star Wars’ Mos Eisley Cantina – remains a fave for longstayers and charas smokers.

Morjim & Asvem
Morjim and Asvem, a peaceful strip of uncrowded sand stretching north from the Chapora river mouth, are two North Goan beaches where sunbathing doesn’t attract hordes of hawkers, dogs and onlookers. The water, though, does suffer from a bit of river run-off pollution and the sand is more black than golden. Rare olive ridley turtles nest at Morjim’s southern end from November to February, so this is a protected area, but it's developing rapidly due mainly to a heavy influx of Russian visitors.

Mandrem
Mellow Mandrem has developed in recent years from an in-the-know piece of beach heaven for those seeking a change from the traveller scenes of Arambol and Anjuna to a fairly mainstream but still incredibly lovely hangout. An unusual feature of Mandrem is the narrow river inlet separating the whitesand beach from most of the accommodation strip and road – rickety bamboo bridges connect you to the beach, where seasonal shack restaurants set up. Development here is still low-key compared to most resorts in Goa and the beaches are largely free of hawkers and tourist crowds. There’s plenty of yoga, meditation and ayurveda on offer, good dining and space to lay down with a good book. Many travellers believe there’s no better place in North Goa.

Arambol (Harmal)
With its craggy cliffs, sweeping beach and remote northerly location, Arambol first emerged in the 1960s as a mellow paradise for long-haired longstayers, and ever since travellers have been drifting up to this blissed-out corner of Goa. As a result, in high season the beach and the road leading down to it (known as Glastonbury St) can get pretty crowded – with huts, people and nonstop stalls selling the usual tourist stuff.
Further north around the headland is the near-deserted Querim (Keri) beach where the Terekhol River meets the coast.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
DUDHSAGAR FALLS
On the eastern border with Karnataka, Dudhsagar Falls (603m) are Goa’s most impressive waterfalls, and the second highest in India, best seen as soon as possible after the rains. The main access is the village of Colem, from where jeeps (₹400 per person for six passengers) make the bumpy but scenic 40-minute drive to the car park from where it's a short scramble to the falls A nice way to get here is the 8.15am train to Kulem (Colem) from Margao (check return times), then pick up a jeep. An easier option (especially if coming from your beach resort rather than Margao) is to take a taxi, book with a travel agent, or take a full-day GTDC tour from Panaji, Mapusa or Calangute
(₹1200, Wed & Sun).
8 Getting There & Around
BUS
Long-distance buses depart from Kadamba bus stand and a private stand, both about 2km north of the Municipal Gardens. Shuttle buses (₹30, 35 minutes) run to Panaji every few minutes. For North Goa destinations head to Panaji and change there. Local buses to Benaulim (₹10, 20 minutes), Colva (₹10, 20 minutes) and Palolem (₹40, one hour) stop at the bus stop on the east side of the Municipal Gardens every 15 minutes or so.
Private buses ply interstate routes several times daily, most departing between 5.30pm and 7.30pm, and can be booked at offices around town; try Paulo

Taxis go to Palolem (₹900), Panaji (₹800), Dabolim airport (₹600), Calangute (₹1000) and Anjuna (₹1200). Except for the train station, where there’s a prepaid booth, you’ll have to negotiate the fare with the driver.
TRAIN
Margao’s well-organised train station, about 2km south of town, serves the Konkan Railway and other routes. Its reservation hall (%PNR enquiry 0832-
2700730, information 0832-2712790; h8am-2pm & 2.15-8pm Mon-Sat, 8am-2pm Sun) is on the 1st
floor. A taxi or autorickshaw to or from the town centre should cost around ₹100.WORTH A TRIP
HAMPI
The surreal ruins of the Vijayanagar empire at Hampi, in Karanakata, are a popular detour or overnight trip from Goa. Hampi can be reached by train from Margao to Hospet on the VSG Howrah Express which departs at 7.10am Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹235/620/885, eight hours). More convenient are the overnight sleeper buses direct to Hampi from Margao and Panaji operated by Paulo Travel (₹900to ₹1100, 10 to 11 hours, 2-3 daily).
Chandor
The lush village of Chandor, 15km east of Margao, makes a perfect day away from the beaches, and it’s here more than anywhere else in the state that the once opulent lifestyles of Goa’s former landowners, who found favour with the Portuguese aristocracy, are still visible in its quietly decaying colonial-era mansions. Chandor hosts the colourful Feast of the Three Kings on the 6 January, during which local boys re-enact the arrival of the three kings from the Christmas story.
Braganza House , built in the 17th century, is possibly the best example of what Goa’s scores of once grand and glorious mansions have today become. Built on land granted by the King of Portugal, the house was divided from the outset into two wings, to house two sides of the same family. The West Wing
(%0832-2784201; donation ₹150; h9am-5pm) belongs to one set of the family’s
descendants, the Menezes-Bragança, and is filled with gorgeous chandeliers, Italian marble floors, rosewood furniture, and antique treasures from Macau, Portugal, China and Europe. Despite the passing of the elderly Mrs Aida Menezes-Bragança in 2012, the grand old home, which requires considerable upkeep, remains open to the public. Next door, the East Wing (%0832-2784227; donation ₹100; h10am-6pm) is owned by the Braganza-Pereiras, descendants of the other half of the family. It’s nowhere near as grand, but it’s beautiful in its own lived-in way, and has a small but striking family chapel that contains a carefully hidden fingernail of St Francis Xavier – a relic that's understandably a source of great pride. Both homes are open daily, and there’s almost always someone around to let you in. Donations are requested and expected.
About 1km east of Chandor's church, the original building of the Fernandes
House (%0832-2784245; donation ₹200; h9am-6pm), also known as Casa Grande,
dates back more than 500 years, while the Portuguese section was tacked on by the Fernandes family in 1821. The secret basement hideaway, full of gun holes and with an escape tunnel to the river, was used by the family to flee attackers.Colva & Benaulim
Pop 12,000
Colva and Benaulim boast broad, open beaches, but are no longer the first place backpackers head in south Goa – most tourists here are of the domestic or ageing European varieties. There's no party scene as in north Goa and they lack the beauty and traveller vibe of Palolem. Still, these are the closest beaches to the major transport hubs of Margao and Dabolim airport. Benaulim has the greater charm, with only a small strip of shops and a village vibe, though out of high season it sometimes has the melancholy feel of a deserted seaside town.

Cross the Sal River from Cavelossim to Assolna on the huge new bridge and continue south to the rustic but charming fishing village of Betul.
From Betul the road winds over gorgeous, undulating hills thick with palm groves. It’s worth detouring to the bleak old Portuguese fort of Cabo da Rama, which has a small church within the fort walls, stupendous views and several old buildings rapidly becoming one with the trees.
Back on the main road to Agonda, look out for the turnoff to the right (west) to Cola Beach, one of south Goa's most gorgeous hidden beach gems complete with emerald-green lagoon. It's reached via a rough 2km dirt road from the highway, but it's not totally deserted – a couple of busy hut villages and a tent resort set up in season. About 500m north of the Cola turnoff is another jungle- strewn path to Khancola (or Kakolem) beach, with steep steps leading a secluded beach and just a handful of huts.
Agonda is only about 2.5km south of the Cola Beach turnoff.Agonda
Agonda Beach is a fine 2km stretch of white sand framed between two forested headlands. Travellers have been drifting here for years and seasonal hut villages – some very luxurious – now occupy almost all available beachfront space, but it's still much more low-key than Palolem and a good choice if you're after some relaxation. Rare Olive Ridley turtles nest at the northern end of the beach, which is protected by the Forest Department.
There’s lots of yoga and ayurveda in Agonda and a community feel among the shops and cafes in the street running parallel to the beach. There's a HDFC ATM near the church crossroads.

Palolem & Around
Palolem is undoubtedly one of Goa's most postcard-perfect beaches: a gentle curve of palm-fringed sand facing a calm bay. But in season it's bursting at the seams.
If you want to see what Palolem looked like 10 or 15 years ago, turn up in September or early October, before the beach huts start to go up. Once the hammering and sawing starts, the beachfront is transformed into a toy-town of colourful and increasingly sophisticated timber and bamboo huts fronted by palm-thatch restaurants. It's still a great place to be and is popular with backpackers, longstayers and families. Aside from being one of the safestswimming and kayaking beaches in Goa, Palolem is a great place to learn to cook, drop in to yoga classes or hire a motorbike and cruise to surrounding beaches, waterfalls and wildlife parks. At night you can listen to live rock or reggae as the sun sets or dance in silence at a headphone party.
Further south is the small rocky cove of Colomb Bay, with several basic places to stay, and then peaceful and pretty Patnem Beach, a more relaxed version of Palolem with just a dozen or so beach hut villages and shack restaurants.Palolem

About 9km southeast of Palolem, and a good day trip, is the beautiful, remote- feeling Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, Goa’s second-largest sanctuary and easily its most accessible, if you have your own transport. Don’t expect to bump into its more exotic residents (including gaurs, sambars, leopards and spotted deer), but frogs, snakes, monkeys, insects and blazingly plumed birds are in no short supply.

This adventure company, run by an experienced French guide, will take you out for thrilling trekking and canyoning trips in the Netravali area at the base of the Western Ghats, where you climb, jump and abseil into remote waterfilled plunges. Trips run from a half-day to several days, and extended rafting trips into Karnataka are also sometimes offered.4 Sleeping
Palolem
Most of Palolem’s accommodation is of the seasonal beach-hut variety, though there are plenty of old-fashioned guesthouses or family homes to be found back from the beach with decent rooms from ₹600. It's still possible to find a basic palm-thatch hut without bathroom somewhere near the beach for ₹700, but most of the huts these days are made of plywood or timber and come with attached bathrooms and multiple levels. The very best sea-facing rooms feature air-con, flat-screen TVs and balconies and command more than ₹5000. Since the huts are dismantled and rebuilt each year, standards and ownership can vary – the places listed here are either permanent guesthouses or well-established hut operations.

You can't beat the location, on the beachfront at the main road entrance to the beach, but Palolem Beach Resort has lifted its prices in keeping with everywhere else in Palolem. It's good value in the fringe seasons when it's one of the only beachfront places open. There are average permanent rooms (air-con ones are by far the best), seasonal huts at the front and a friendly beachfront restaurant.

It’s in an isolated but easily reached location between Palolem and Agonda, but given noise restrictions we don’t know if it will endure. Friday night at time of research but possibly Sunday too.
SILENT PARTIESSILENT PARTIES
Considerately sidestepping the statewide ban on loud music after 10pm, Palolem is the home of popular silent rave parties where guests don a pair of headphones and dance the night away in inward bliss but outward quiet. You get the choice of two or three channels featuring inhouse Goan and international DJs playing hip hop, house, electro and funk. The concept came from British expats (now operating at Alpha Bar) but others jumped on the bandwagon and at last count there were four events, all operating on different night:

8 Information Palolem’s main road is lined with travel agencies, internet places and money changers. The nearest ATM is about
1.5km away, where the main highway meets Palolem Beach Rd, or head to nearby Chaudi.
8 Getting There & Around Frequent buses run to nearby Chaudi (₹7) from the bus stop on the corner of the road down to the beach.
There are hourly buses to Margao (₹40, one hour) from the same place. From Chaudi you can also pick up regular buses to Margao, from where you can change for Panaji, or south to Polem Beach andKarwar (Karnataka). Local buses run regularly to Agonda (₹10).
The closest train station is Canacona, 2km from Palolem’s beach entrance, which is useful for trains south to Gokarna and Mangalore.
An autorickshaw from Palolem to Patnem should cost ₹80, to Chaudi ₹120 and to Agonda ₹250. A taxi to Dabolim Airport is around ₹1200.
Scooters and motorbikes can easily be hired along the main road leading to the beach from ₹200. Mountain bikes (₹100 per day) can be hired from Seema Bike Hire on Ourem Rd.

A Tanshikar Spice Farm (%0832-2608358, 9421184114; www.tanshikarspicefarm.com; Netravali; spice tour incl lunch ₹450; h10am-4pm) About 35km inland from Palolem via forest and farms is this excellent spice plantation, along with jungle treks to waterfalls and the enigmatic 'bubble lake'.
A Talpona & Galgibag These two near-deserted beach gems are scenically framed (naturally) by the Talpona and Galgibag rivers. Olive Ridley turtles nest on Galgibag and there are a couple of excellent shack restaurants and huts. The winding country drive here is half the fun.
A Polem Beach Goa's most southerly beach, 25km south of Palolem, has just one set of beach huts and a real castaway feel. A trip here should be combined with the detour to Talpona and Galgibag.Karnataka & Bengaluru

Karnataka & BengaluruWhy Go?
Blessed with a a diverse makeup conforming to all the romance of quintessential India, Karnataka delivers with its winning blend of palaces, tiger reserves, megacities, ancient ruins, beaches and legendary hang-outs.
At its nerve centre is the silicon-capital Bengaluru (Bangalore), overfed with the good life. Scattered around the epicurean city are rolling hills dotted with spice and coffee plantations, the regal splendour of Mysuru (Mysore), and jungles teeming with monkeys, tigers and Asia’s biggest population of elephants.
If that all sounds too mainstream, head to the countercultural enclave of tranquil Hampi with hammocks, psychedelic sunsets and boulder-strewn ruins. Or the blissful beaches of Gokarna, a beach haven minus the doof doof. Otherwise leave the tourist trail behind entirely, and take a journey to the stunning Islamic ruins of northern Karnataka.
When to GoA Mar–May The best season to watch tigers and elephants in Karnataka’s pristine national parks.
A Oct Mysuru’s Dussehra (Dasara) carnival brings night-long celebrations and a jumbo parade.
A Dec & Jan The coolest time to explore the northern districts’ forts, palaces, caves and temples.

History
A rambling playing field of religions, cultures and kingdoms, Karnataka has been ruled by a string of charismatic rulers through history. India’s first great emperor, Chandragupta Maurya, made the state his retreat when he embraced Jainism at Sravanabelagola in the 3rd century BC. From the 6th to the 14th centuries AD, the land was under a series of dynasties such as the Chalukyas, Cholas, Gangas and Hoysalas, who left a lasting mark in the form of stunning cave shrines and temples across the state.
In 1327 Mohammed Tughlaq’s army sacked Halebid. In 1347 Hasan Gangu, a Persian general in Tughlaq’s army, led a rebellion to establish the Bahmani kingdom, which was later subdivided into five Deccan sultanates. Meanwhile, the Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar, with its capital in Hampi, rose to prominence. Having peaked in the early 1550s, it fell in 1565 to a combined effort of the sultanates.
In subsequent years the Hindu Wodeyars of Mysore grew in stature and extended their rule over a large part of southern India. They remained largely unchallenged until 1761, when Hyder Ali (one of their generals) deposed them. Backed by the French, Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan set up capital in Srirangapatnam and consolidated their rule. However, in 1799 the British defeated Tipu Sultan and reinstated the Wodeyars. Historically, this flagged offBritish territorial expansion in southern India.
Mysore remained under the Wodeyars until Independence – post-1947, the reigning maharaja became the first governor. The state boundaries were redrawn along linguistic lines in 1956 and the extended Kannada-speaking state of Mysore was born. It was renamed Karnataka in 1972, with Bangalore (now Bengaluru) as the capital.
SOUTHERN KARNATAKA
Bengaluru (Bangalore)
%080 Pop 10.2 million Elev 920m
Cosmopolitan Bengaluru is the number one city in the Indian deep south, blessed with a benevolent climate and a burgeoning drinking, dining and shopping scene. It’s not necessarily a place you come to be wowed by world-class sights (though it has some lovely parks and striking Victorian-era architecture), but instead to experience the new modern face of India.
As the hub of India’s booming IT industry, it vies with Mumbai (Bombay) as the nation's most progressive city, and its creature comforts can be a godsend to the weary traveller who has done the hard yards. It’s a big student town where you’ll encounter hip locals chatting in English while drinking craft beer and getting around in ’80s metal band T-shirts.
The past decade has seen a mad surge of development, coupled with traffic congestion and rising pollution levels. However, it’s a city that has also taken care to preserve its green space and its colonial-era heritage. So while urbanisation continually pushes its boundaries outward, the central district (dating back to the British Raj years) remains more or less unchanged.
History
Literally meaning ‘Town of Boiled Beans', Bengaluru supposedly derived its name from an ancient incident involving an old village woman who served cooked pulses to a lost and hungry Hoysala king. Kempegowda, a feudal lord, was the first person to mark out Bengaluru’s extents by building a mud fort inp
g
yg
1537. The town remained obscure until 1759, when it was gifted to Hyder Ali by the Mysore maharaja.
The British arrived in 1809 and made it their regional administrative base in 1831, renaming it Bangalore. During the Raj era the city played host to many a British officer, including Winston Churchill, who enjoyed life here during his greener years and famously left a debt (still on the books) of ₹13 at the Bangalore Club.
Now home to countless software, electronics and business-outsourcing firms, Bengaluru’s knack for technology developed early. In 1905 it was the first Indian city to have electric street lighting. Since the 1940s it has been home to Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), India’s largest aerospace company. And if you can’t do without email, you owe it all to a Bangalorean – Sabeer Bhatia, the inventor of Hotmail, grew up here.
The city’s name was changed back to Bengaluru in November 2006, though few care to use it in practice.
8 Orientation Finding your way around Bengaluru can be difficult at times. In certain areas, roads are named after their widths (eg 80ft Rd). The city also follows a system of mains and crosses: 3rd Cross, 5th Main, Residency Rd, for example, refers to the third lane on the fifth street branching off Residency Rd. New affluent pockets are springing up across the city, including the ritzy suburbs of Indirangar, JP Nagar, Koramangala and Whitefield – all with Western-style malls, nightlife and restaurants.Bengaluru (Bangalore)

WHISKEY & WINE
In a country not known for being a big exponent of fine wines and liquors (anyone who has stepped foot into one of India’s ubiquitous ‘wine shops’ can attest to this), Bengaluru (Bangalore) is very much an exception to the rule. It’s a city that’s not only gained a thirst for craft beer (Click here), but has on its doorstep one of India’s premier wine-growing regions in Nandi Hills. While an emerging industry, it’s fast gaining a reputation internationally with some 18 wineries in the area. Also a few clicks out of town is India’s first single-malt whiskey distillery, where you’re also able to sample the goods.o Grover Wineries

You get taken through the entire process before tasting its world-class single malts and blends. It’s 20km outside Bangaluru on the road to Mysuru; pre-bookings essential.
Nandi Hills
Rising to 1455m, Nandi Hills (admission ₹10, car ₹150; h6am-6pm), 60km north of Bengaluru, were once the summer retreat of Tipu Sultan (his palace is still here). Today it’s the Bengaluru techie’s favourite weekend getaway, and is predictably congested on Saturday and Sunday; aim to visit midweek. Nonetheless, it’s a good place for a leisurely hike, panoramic views of sweeping plains and two notable Chola temples. It’s a 2km hike to the top from the entrance gate for those without a vehicle. Macaques run amok, so avoid carrying food.
At the top of Nandi Hills, Hotel Mayura Pine Top (%8970650019; Nandi Hills; mains ₹80-160; h10.30am-8pm) does good Indian dishes which can be enjoyed with excellent views from it’s glassed-in restaurant. Its rooms (with fan/air-con
₹1500/3000) also feature stellar views.
Around Nandi Hills is one of India’s premier wine-growing regions. Buses head to Nandi Hills (₹65, two hours) from Bengaluru’s Kempegowda
(Central Majestic) bus stand.
HessaraghattaLocated 30km northwest of Bengaluru, Hessaraghatta is home to Nrityagram
(%080-28466313; www.nrityagram.org; self-guided tour ₹50; h10am-2pm Tue-Sun), a leading
dance academy established in 1990 to revive and popularise Indian classical dance. The brainchild and living legacy of celebrated dancer Protima Gauri Bedi (1948–98), the complex was designed like a village by Goa-based architect Gerard da Cunha. You can take a self-guided tour, or book a tour, lecture and demonstration and vegetarian meal (₹1500 to ₹2000, minimum 10 people). Note the early 2pm closure.
From Bengaluru’s City Market, buses 266, 253, 253D and 253E run to Hessaraghatta (₹25, one hour), with bus 266 continuing on to Nrityagram. From Hessaraghatta an autorickshaw will cost ₹70.

One of South India’s most famous tourist destinations, Mysuru (which recently changed its name from Mysore) is known for its glittering royal heritage and magnificent monuments and buildings. Its World Heritage–listed palace may be what brings most travellers here, but it’s also a thriving centre for the production of premium silk, sandalwood and incense. These days ashtanga yoga is another drawcard, attracting visitors worldwide with its reputation as one of India’s best places to practise yoga.History Mysuru owes its name to the mythical Mahisuru, a place where the demon Mahisasura was slain by the goddess Chamundi. Its regal history began in 1399, when the Wodeyar dynasty of Mysuru was founded, though they remained in service of the Vijayanagar empire until the mid-16th century. With the fall of Vijayanagar in 1565, the Wodeyars declared their sovereignty, which – save a brief period of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan’s supremacy in the late 18th century – remained unscathed until Independence in 1947.

₹40/200, child under 10 free; h10am-5.30pm)
Among the grandest of India’s royal buildings, this fantastic palace was the former seat of the Wodeyar maharajas. The old palace was gutted by fire in 1897; the one you see now was completed in 1912 by English architect Henry Irwin at a cost of ₹4.5 million. The interior of this Indo-Saracenic marvel – a kaleidoscope of stained glass, mirrors and gaudy colours – is lavish and undoubtedly over the top. The decor is further embellished by carved wooden doors, mosaic floors and a series of paintings depicting life in Mysore during the Edwardian Raj era.
The way into the palace takes you past a fine collection of sculptures and artefacts. Don’t forget to check out the armoury, with an intriguing collection of 700-plus weapons.
Every Sunday and national holiday, from 7pm to 7.45pm, the palace is illuminated by nearly 100,000 light bulbs that accent its majestic profile against the night.
Entrance to the palace grounds is at the South Gate (

CULTURE
Mysuru (Mysore) is at its carnivalesque best during the 10-day Dussehra (locally spelt ‘Dasara’) festival held September or October. During this time the Mysore Palace is dramatically lit up every evening, while the town is transformed into a gigantic fairground, with concerts, dance performances, sporting demonstrations and cultural events runningwith concerts, dance performances, sporting demonstrations and cultural events running to packed houses.
On the last day the celebrations are capped off in grand style. A dazzling procession of richly costumed elephants, garlanded idols, liveried retainers and cavalry, marches through the streets to the rhythms of clanging brass bands.
Mysuru is choc-a-bloc with tourists during the festival, especially on the final day. To bypass suffocating crowds, consider buying a Dasara VIP Gold Card (₹7500 for two adults). Though expensive, it assures you good seats at the final day gala and helps you beat the entry queues at other events and performances, while providing discounts on accommodation, dining and shopping. It’s also possible to buy tickets (₹250 to ₹1000) just for entering the palace and Bannimantap for the final day’s parades.

Srirangapatnam
%08236
Steeped in bloody history, the fort town of Srirangapatnam, 16km from Mysuru, is built on an island straddling the Cauvery River. The seat of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan’s power, this town was the de facto capital of much of southern India during the 18th century. Srirangapatnam’s glory days ended when the British waged an epic war against Tipu Sultan in 1799, when he was defeated and killed. His sword and the ring he wore in battle are now displayed in the British Museum in London. The ramparts, battlements and some of the gates of the fort still stand, as do a clutch of monuments. The island is now linked to the mainland by bridge.

It’s also home to an impressive 350 species of bird. Only 80km south of Mysuru on the Ooty road, it’s very accessible from both Bengaluru and Mysuru.

It has an atmospheric thatched-roof dining hall, and evenings can be enjoyed around the bonfire.
Animals visit occasionally, so be vigilant at night, and be warned monkeys and rodents can be serious a nuisance, so don’t leave food (or valuables) lying around your room. There’s no alcohol here, so bring your own. It’s located 10km from the park; call ahead to arrange a pick-up (₹300).

National Park (Rajiv Gandhi National Park; Indian/foreigner ₹200/1000, video ₹1000; h6am-6pm), pronounced 'nag-ar-hole-eh', is one of Karnataka’s best wildlife getaways. Adjoining Kabini Lake, it forms an important animal corridor that runs through neighbouring Bandipur National Park – making up a part of the Nilgiri Bioshpere Reserve. Despite sharing the same wildlife, it sees much fewer visitors than Bandipur, making it all the more appealing. Set over 643 sq km, Nagarhole features a good blend of dense jungle and open sightlines along the river bank, which makes for fantastic wildlife-watching. Its lush forests are home to tigers, leopards, elephants, gaurs, barking deer, dholes, bonnet macaques and common langurs, plus 270 species of bird. The park can remain closed for long stretches between July and October, when the rains transform the forests into a giant slush-pit.
The traditional inhabitants of the land, the hunter-gatherer Jenu Kuruba people, still live in the park, despite government efforts to relocate them.
The best time to view wildlife is during summer (April to May), though winter (November to February) is more comfortable.
Government-run 4WD safaris (Kabini River Lodge; 2½hr 4WD safari ₹2000) and boat trips (Kabini River Lodge; per person ₹2000) are conducted from Kabini River Lodge
between 6.30am and 9.30am and 3.15pm and 6.15pm, which are both good ways to see animals.

Kodagu (Coorg) RegionNestled amid ageless hills that line the southernmost edge of Karnataka is the luscious Kodagu (Coorg) region, gifted with emerald landscapes and acres of plantations. A major centre for coffee and spice production, this rural expanse is also home to the unique Kodava race, believed to have descended from migrating Persians and Kurds, or perhaps even Greeks left behind from Alexander the Great’s armies. The uneven terrain and cool climate make it a fantastic area for trekking, birdwatching or lazily ambling down little-trodden paths winding around carpeted hills. All in all, Kodagu is rejuvenation guaranteed.
Kodagu was a state in its own right until 1956, when it merged with Karnataka. The region’s chief town and transport hub is Madikeri, but for an authentic Kodagu experience, you have to venture into the plantations. Avoid weekends, when places can quickly get filled up by weekenders from Bengaluru. 2 Activities Exploring the region by foot is a highlight for many visitors. Treks are part cultural experience, part nature encounter, involving hill climbs, plantation visits, forest walks and homestays.
The best season for trekking is October to March; there are no treks during monsoon. The most popular peaks are the seven-day trek to Tadiyendamol (1745m), and to Pushpagiri (1712m) and Kotebetta (1620m). As well as good walking shoes you’ll need insect repellant. A trekking guide is essential for navigating the labyrinth of forest tracks.

DON'T MISSBYLAKUPPE
Tiny Bylakuppe was among the first refugee camps set up in South India to house thousands of Tibetans who fled from Tibet following the 1959 Chinese invasion. Over 10,000 Tibetans live here (including some 3300 monks), making it South India’s largest Tibetan settlement.
The area’s highlight is the atmospheric Namdroling Monastery (www.palyul.org), home to the spectacular Golden Temple (Padmasambhava Buddhist Vihara; h7am-8pm), presided over by three 18m-high gold-plated Buddha statues. The temple is at its dramatic best when prayers are in session and it rings out with gongs, drums and the drone of hundreds of young monks chanting. You’re welcome to sit and meditate; look for the small blue guest cushions lying around. The Zangdogpalri Temple (h7am-8pm), a similarly ornate affair, is next door.
Foreigners are not allowed to stay overnight in Bylakuppe without a Protected Area Permit (PAP) from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Delhi, which can take up to five months to process. Contact the Tibet Bureau Office (%11–26479737; www.tibetbureau.in; New Delhi) for details. Day-trippers are welcome to visit, however.

Belur & Halebid
%08177 / Elev 968m
The Hoysala temples at Halebid (also known as Halebeedu) and Belur (also called Beluru) are the apex of one of the most artistically exuberant periods of ancient Hindu cultural development. Architecturally, they are South India’s answer to Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh and Konark near Puri in Odisha (Orissa).
Only 16km lie between Belur and Halebid; they are connected by frequent buses from 6.30am to 7pm (₹25, 40 minutes).To get here you’ll need to pass through the busy transport hub of Hassan – easily accessible from Mysuru and Bengaluru, with buses departing regularly to Mysuru (₹115, three hours), Bengaluru (semideluxe/deluxe ₹195/392, 3½ hours) and Mangaluru (₹166/380, 3½ hours). From Hassan’s well-organised train station, several passenger trains head to Mysuru daily (2nd class ₹140, 2½hours). For Bengaluru, there’s the red-eye 2.50am 16518 Bangalore Express (sleeper ₹180, 5½ hours). It’s also possible to visit on day trip from Bengaluru or Mysuru with a KSTDC tour.
Belur
The Channakeshava Temple (Temple Rd; h7.30am-7.30pm) was commissioned in
AD 1116 to commemorate the Hoysalas’ victory over the neighbouring Cholas. It took more than a century to build, and is currently the only one among the three major Hoysala sites still in daily use – try to be there for the ritual puja (prayer) ceremonies at around 8.45am and 6.45pm. Some parts of the temple, such as the exterior lower friezes, were not sculpted to completion and are thus less elaborate than those of the other Hoysala temples. However, the work higher up is unsurpassed in detail and artistry, and is a glowing tribute to human skill. Particularly intriguing are the angled bracket figures depicting women in ritual dancing poses. While the front of the temple is reserved for images depicting erotic sections from the Kamasutra, the back is strictly for gods. The roof of the inner sanctum is held up by rows of exquisitely sculpted pillars, no two of which are identical in design.
Scattered around the temple complex are other smaller temples, a marriage hall which is still used, and the seven-storey gopuram, which has sensual sculptures explicitly portraying the activities of dancing girls. Guides can be hired for ₹250.
Hotel Mayura Velapuri (%0817-7222209; Kempegowda Rd; d with fan/AC from
₹1000/1350; a), a state-run hotel gleaming with postrenovation glory, is located on the way to the temple, and is the best place to camp in Belur. Its restaurant- bar serves a variety of Indian dishes (from ₹80) to go with beer. The cheaper

There’s an Axis ATM on the road leading to the temple.There are frequent buses to/from Hassan (₹40 to ₹90, 45 minutes), 38km away.
Halebid
Construction of the stunning Hoysaleswara Temple (hdawn-dusk), Halebid’s claim to fame, began around AD 1121 and went on for more than 190 years. It was never completed, but nonetheless stands today as a masterpiece of Hoysala architecture. The interior of its inner sanctum, chiselled out of black stone, is marvellous. On the outside, the temple’s richly sculpted walls are covered with a flurry of Hindu deities, sages, stylised animals and friezes depicting the life of the Hoysala rulers. Two statues of Nandi (Shiva’s bull) sit to the left of the main temple, facing the inner sanctum. Guides are available for ₹250.
The temple is within in large, well-tended gardens, adjacent to which is a
small museum (admission ₹5; h9am-5pm Sat-Thu) with a collection of beautiful
sculptures from around Halebid.
Take some time out to visit the nearby, smaller Kedareswara Temple, or a little-visited enclosure containing three Jain temples about 500m away, which also have fine carvings.
Hotel Mayura Shanthala (%0817-7273224; d incl breakfast with AC from ₹1500;
aW), set in a leafy garden opposite the temple complex, is the best sleeping option.
Regular buses depart for Hassan (₹35, one hour), 33km away, while buses to Belur are ₹25 for the 15km journey.
Sravanabelagola
%08176
Atop the bald rock of Vindhyagiri Hill, the 17.5m-high statue of the Jain deity Gomateshvara (Bahubali) is visible long before you reach the pilgrimage town of Sravanabelagola. Viewing the statue close up is the main reason for heading to this sedate town, whose name means ‘Monk of the White Pond'.1 Sights
Gomateshvara Statue
(Bahubali; h6.30am-6.30pm)
JAIN MONUMENT
A steep climb up 614 steps takes you to the top of Vindhyagiri Hill, the summit of which is lorded over by the towering naked statue of the Jain deity Gomateshvara (Bahubali). Commissioned by a military commander in the service of the Ganga king Rachamalla and carved out of a single piece of granite by the sculptor Aristenemi in AD 98, it is said to be the world’s tallest monolithic statue. Leave your shoes at the foot of the hill.
Bahubali was the son of emperor Vrishabhadeva, who later became the first Jain tirthankar (revered teacher) Adinath. Embroiled in fierce competition with his brother Bharatha to succeed his father, Bahubali realised the futility of material gains and renounced his kingdom. As a recluse, he meditated in complete stillness in the forest until he attained enlightenment. His lengthy meditative spell is denoted by vines curling around his legs and an ant hill at his feet.
Every 12 years, millions flock here to attend the Mastakabhisheka (hFeb) ceremony, when the statue is dowsed in holy waters, pastes, powders, precious metals and stones. The next ceremony is slated for 2018.
Jain Temples
Apart from the Bahubali statue, there are several interesting Jain temples in town. The Chandragupta Basti (Chandragupta Community; h6am-6pm), on Chandragiri Hill opposite Vindhyagiri, is believed to have been built by Emperor Ashoka. The Bhandari Basti (Bhandari Community; h6am-6pm), in the southeast corner of town, is Sravanabelagola’s largest temple. Nearby, Chandranatha Basti (Chandranatha Community; h6am-6pm) has well-preserved paintings depicting Jain tales.
4 Sleeping & Eating The local Jain organisation SDJMI (%08176-257258) handles bookings for its 15 guesthouses(double/triple ₹250/310). The office is behind the Vidyananda Nilaya Dharamsala, past the post office.

KARNATAKA COAST
Mangaluru (Mangalore)
%0824 / Pop 484,785
Alternating from relaxed coastal town to hectic nightmare, Mangaluru (more commonly known as Mangalore) has a Jekyll and Hyde thing going, but it’s a pleasant enough place to break up your trip. While there’s not a lot to do here, it has an appealing off-the-beaten-path feel, and the spicy seafood dishes are sensational.
It sits at the estuaries of the picturesque Netravathi and Gurupur Rivers on the Arabian Sea coast and has been a major pit stop on international trade routes since the 6th century AD. It was ruled by the Portuguese during the 16th and 17th centuries, before the British took over a century later.Mangaluru (Mangalore)

RANI ABBAKKA THE WARRIOR QUEEN
The legendary exploits of Rani Abbakka, one of India’s first freedom fighters – who happened to be a female – is one that gets surprisingly little attention outside the Mangaluru region. An Indian Joan of Arc, her inspiring story is just waiting to be picked up by a Bollywood/Hollywood screenwriter.
As the Portuguese consolidated their power along India’s western coastline in the 16th century, seizing towns across Goa and down to Mangalaru (Mangalore), their attempts to take Ullal proved more of a challenge. This was thanks to its ‘fearless queen’ who proved to be a major thorn in their grand plans to control the lucrative spice trade. Her efforts to continually repell their advances is the stuff of local legend.
Well trained in the art of war, both in strategy and combat, she knew how to brandish a sword. And while she was eventually defeated, this wasn’t a result from a loss on the battlefield, but her treacherous ex-husband, who conspired against her in leaking intelligence to the enemy.
Her efforts to rally her people to defeat the powerful Portuguese is not forgotten by locals: she’s immortalised in a bronze statue on horseback at the roundabout on the road to Ullal beach, and has an annual festival dedicated to her.
The shore temple that looks over the beautiful Someshwara beach a few kilometres south from Ullal was the former site of her fort, but only sections of its wall remains intact.4 Sleeping

(Mantra Surf Club; %9880659130; www.surfingindia.net; 6-64 Kolachikambla, Mulki; s/d incl full board from ₹3000/4500; W)
While there has always been a spiritual bond between surfer and Mother ocean, the Surfing Ashram at Mulki, 30km north of Mangaluru, takes things to a whole new plane. At this Hare Krishna ashram, which was established by its American guru who's been surfing since 1963 (and living in India for four decades), devotees follow a daily ritual of puja (prayers), chanting, mediation and vegetarian diet in between catching barrels.
There’s surf year-round, but the best waves are May to June and September to October. The swamis can also assist with information on surfing across India. Board hire is ₹700 per day (it also has bodyboards and stand-up paddleboards) and lessons are
₹2500 per day.
Accommodation is pricey, but it has a homely beach-house feel, and rates include meals.
All are welcome to visit, but it’s important to be aware that it’s strictly a place of worship and there are guidelines to abide by including abstinence from meat alcoholworship and there are guidelines to abide by, including abstinence from meat, alcohol, tobacco and sex during your stay. See the website for more details.
Dharmasthala
Inland from Mangaluru are a string of Jain temple towns, such as Venur, Mudabidri and Karkal. The most interesting among them is Dharmasthala, 75km east of Mangaluru by the Netravathi River. Some 10,000 pilgrims pass through this town every day. During holidays and major festivals such as the five-day pilgrim festival of Lakshadeepotsava (hNov), the footfall can go up tenfold.
The Manjunatha Temple (h6.30am-2pm & 5-9pm) is Dharmasthala’s main
shrine, devoted to Shiva. Men have to enter bare-chested with legs covered. Simple free meals are available in the temple’s kitchen (h11.30am-2.15pm & 7.30- 10pm), attached to a hall that can seat up to 3000.
Associated sights in town include the 12m-high statue of Bahubali at
Ratnagiri Hill, and the Manjusha Museum (admission ₹5; h9am-1pm & 4.30-9pm),
which houses an eclectic collection of everything from artefacts to quirky collections of vintage cameras, telephones and typewriters. Don’t forget to visit
the fantastic Car Museum (admission ₹3; h8.30am-1pm & 2-7pm), home to 48 vintage
autos, including a 1903 Renault and 1920s Studebaker President used by Mahatma Gandhi.
Should you wish to stay, contact the helpful temple office (%0825-6277121; www.shridharmasthala.org) for accommodation in pilgrim lodges (per person ₹50).
There are frequent buses to Dharmasthala from Mangaluru (₹72, 2½ hours).
FORMULA BUFFALO
Call it an indigenous take on the Grand Prix, Kambla, or traditional buffalo racing, is a hugely popular pastime among villagers along the southern Karnataka coast. Popularised in the early 20th century and born out of local farmers habitually racing their buffaloes home after a day in the fields, the races have now hit the big time. Thousands of spectators attend each edition, and racing buffaloes are pampered and prepared like thoroughbreds.
Kambla events are held between November and March, usually on weekends. Parallel tracks are laid out in a paddy field along which buffaloes hurtle towards the finish line Intracks are laid out in a paddy field, along which buffaloes hurtle towards the finish line. In most cases the man rides on a board fixed to a ploughshare, literally surfing his way down the track behind the beasts. The faster creatures can cover the 120m-odd distance through water and mud in around 14 seconds.
Udupi (Udipi)
%0820
Udupi is a buzzing yet relaxed pilgrim town that’s home to the atmospheric 13th-century Krishna Temple (Car St; h3.30am-10pm), which draws thousands of Hindu pilgrims throughout the year. Surrounded by eight maths (monasteries), it’s a hive of ritual activity, with temple musicians playing at the entrance, elephants on hand for puja, and pilgrims constantly passing through. Non- Hindus are welcome inside the temple; men must enter bare-chested. Come late afternoon for the best atmosphere.
Udupi is famed for its vegetarian food, and recognised across India for its sumptuous thali and as the birthplace of the humble dosa.

8 Getting There & Away Udupi is 58km north of Mangaluru along the coast; regular buses ply the route (₹56, 1½ hours). Buses also head to Gokarna (₹180, six hours) and Bengaluru (₹410 to ₹870, 10 hours). Regular buses head to Malpe (₹8, 30 minutes).
Malpe
%0820
A laid-back fishing harbour on the west coast 4km from Udupi, Malpe has nice beaches ideal for flopping about in the surf. The ostentatious Paradise Isle
Beach Resort (%0820-2538777; www.theparadiseisle.com; r with fan/AC from ₹2000/4750;
aiWs) has decent rooms; ask for one with a sea view. It can also organise houseboat cruises (per couple ₹4000; hOct-Mar) on backwaters that are similarly scenic to Kerala’s, yet all a bit undeveloped.
From Malpe pier you can take a government ferry (₹100 return, 45 minutes, departing when full from 9am to 5.30pm) or charter a private ferry from Malpe Beach out to tiny St Mary’s Island. It’s known for where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama supposedly landed in 1498, and curious hexagonal basalt formations that jut out of the sand. No boats run between June and mid-October.
Buses to Udupi are ₹8, and an autorickshaw ₹80.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
MURUDESHWAR
A worthwhile stopover for those taking the coastal route from Gokarna to Mangaluru, is Murudeshwar, a beachside pilgrimage town. It’s most notable for its colossal seashore statue of Lord Shiva (Murudeshwar), which sits directly on the shore overlooking the Arabian Sea, making for spectacular photo ops. For the best views, take the lift 20 stories to the top of the skyscraper-like Shri Murudeshwar Temple (Murudeshwar Beach; lift ₹10; hlift 7.45am-12.30pm & 3.15-6.45pm).It’s 3km off the main highway, accessed by train or bus passing up and down the coast. If you want to stay the night, Hotel Kawari’s Palm Grove (%08385-260178; Murudeshwar; r with fan/AC from ₹500/1000; a) has decent enough rooms 500m from the action.
Jog Falls
%08186
Nominally the highest waterfalls in India, Jog Falls only come to life during the monsoon. The tallest of the four falls is the Raja, which drops 293m. For a good view of the falls, bypass the area close to the bus stand and hike to the foot of the falls down a 1200-plus-step path. Watch out for leeches during the wet season.
Hotel Mayura Gerusoppa (%08186-244732; d with fan/AC from ₹1800/2200; a),
near the car park, has a few enormous, musty double rooms. Stalls near the bus stand serve thalis and noodle dishes.
Jog Falls isn’t the easiest place to reach without a car, so most people hire a taxi; a return trip from Gokarna costs around ₹2000. Otherwise you can get a string of buses which head via Kumta and turn off at Honavar (₹66); or Shimoga (Shivamogga) if coming via Bengaluru (₹468, nine hours).
Gokarna
%08386
A regular nominee among travellers’ favourite beaches in India, Gokarna is a more laid-back and less-commercialised version of Goa. It attracts a crowd for a low-key, chilled-out beach holiday and not for full-scale parties. Most accommodation is in thatched bamboo huts along its several stretches of blissful coast.
In fact there are two Gokarnas; adjacent to the beaches is the sacred Hindu pilgrim town of Gokarna, full of ancient temples that come to life during important festivals such as Shivaratri (hFeb/Mar) and Ganesh Chaturthi (hSep). While its lively bazaar is an interesting place to visit, most foreign tourists don’t hang around overnight, instead making a bee-line straight to theadjoining beaches.
Note that bag searches and passport checks by police are common upon arrival.
1 Sights & Activities
Temples
Foreigners and non-Hindus are not allowed inside Gokarna’s temples. However, there are plenty of colourful rituals to be witnessed around town. At the western end of Car St is the Mahabaleshwara Temple, home to a revered lingam. Nearby is the Ganapati Temple, while at the other end of the street is the Venkataraman Temple. About 100m further south is Koorti Teertha, the large temple tank where locals, pilgrims and immaculately dressed Brahmins perform their ablutions.
Beaches & Surfing
The best beaches are due south of Gokarna town, with Om Beach and Kudle Beach being the most popular.
Don’t walk around the paths after dark, and not alone at any time – it’s easy to slip or get lost, and muggings have occurred.
Om Beach
Gokarna’s most famous beach twists and turns over several kilometres in a way that’s said to resemble the outline of an Om symbol. It’s a great mix of lovely long beach and smaller shady patches of sand, perfect for sunbathing and swimming.
It’s a 20-minute walk to Kudle Beach; an autorickhaw to Gokarna town is about ₹150.
Kudle Beach
Lined with rows of restaurants and guesthouses, Kudle Beach has emerged as a popular alternative to Om Beach. It’s one of Gokarna’s longest and widest beaches, with plenty of room to stretch out on its attractive sands.It’s a 20-minute hike from both Gokarna town or Om Beach along a path that heads atop along the barren headland with expansive sea views. Otherwise it’s a ₹60 autorickshaw ride to town.
Gokarna Beach
While Gokarna’s main town beach isn’t meant for casual bathing, and is more popular with domestic tourists, walk up a bit and you’ll find a long stretch of pristine sand that seems to go forever – perfect for those seeking isolation.
Cocopelli Surf School
SURFING
(%8105764969; www.cocopelli.org; Gokarna Beach; lesson per person ₹2000, board rental per 2hr ₹750; hOct-May)
Offers lessons by internationally certified instructors and rents boards. Has accommodation along here too.
Half Moon & Paradise Beach
Well hidden away south of Om Beach lie the small sandy coves of Half Moon Beach and Paradise Beach. Half Moon is the more attractive, with a lovely sweep of powdery sand and basic hut accommodation. Paradise Beach is a mix of sand and rocks, and a haven with the long-term ‘turn-on-tune-in-drop-out’ crowd; unfortunately the government routinely destroys all the huts out this way, leaving it in a ramshackle state – hence it’s BYO everything here.
From Om Beach, these beaches are a 30-minute and one-hour walk, respectively. Watch out for snakes along the path and don’t walk it after dark. A fishing boat from Om Beach will cost around ₹700, which can fit 10 people. For Paradise Beach you can also grab a bus to Velikom from Gokarna (₹12, 20 minutes), from where it’s a 15-minute walk.

Many express trains stop at Gokarna Road station, 9km from town; however, double check your ticket as some stop at Ankola, 26km away. Many of the hotels and small travel agencies in Gokarna can book tickets.
The 3am 12619 Matsyagandha Express goes to Mangaluru (sleeper ₹235, 4½ hours); the return train leaves Kumta around 6.30pm for Margao (sleeper ₹170, 2½ hours) and Mumbai (sleeper/2AC, ₹465/1735, 12 hours).
Autorickshaws charge ₹200 to go to Gokarna Road station (or ₹500 to Ankola); a bus from Gokarna town charges ₹40 and leaves every 30 minutes.CENTRAL KARNATAKA
Hampi
%08394
Unreal and bewitching, the forlorn ruins of Hampi dot an unearthly landscape that will leave you spellbound the moment you cast your eyes on it. Heaps of giant boulders perch precariously over miles of undulating terrain, their rusty hues offset by jade-green palm groves, banana plantations and paddy fields. While it’s possible to see the ancient ruins and temples of this World Heritage Site in a day or two, this goes against Hampi’s relaxed grain. Plan on lingering for a while.
The main travellers’ ghetto has traditionally been Hampi Bazaar, a village crammed with budget lodges, shops and restaurants, and towered over by the majestic Virupaksha Temple. However, recent demolitions have seen tranquil Virupapur Gaddi across the river become the new hang-out. Both offer different experiences, and it's recommended to spend a few nights at each.
Hampi is generally a safe, peaceful place, but don’t wander around the ruins after dark or alone, as it can be dangerous terrain to get lost in, especially at night.
History Hampi and its neighbouring areas find mention in the Hindu epic Ramayana as Kishkinda, the realm of the monkey gods. In 1336 Telugu prince Harihararaya chose Hampi as the site for his new capital Vijayanagar, which – over the next couple of centuries – grew into one of the largest Hindu empires in Indian history. By the 16th century it was a thriving metropolis of about 500,000 people, its busy bazaars dabbling in international commerce, brimming with precious stones and merchants from faraway lands. All this, however, ended in a stroke in 1565, when a confederacy of Deccan sultanates razedVijayanagar to the ground, striking it a death blow from which it never recovered.Hampi & Anegundi

1 Sights Set over 36 sq km, there are some 3700 monuments to explore in Hampi, and it would take months if you were to do it justice. The ruins are divided into two main areas: the Sacred Centre, around Hampi Bazaar with its temples, and the Royal Centre, towards Kamalapuram, where the Vijayanagara royalty lived and governed.
Sacred Centre
o Virupaksha Temple
HINDU TEMPLE

 ; admission ₹2, camera ₹50; hdawn-dusk)
The focal point of Hampi Bazaar is the Virupaksha Temple, one of the city’s oldest structures, and Hampi’s only remaining working temple. The main gopuram (gateway tower), almost 50m high, was built in 1442, with a smaller one added in 1510. The main shrine is dedicated to Virupaksha, an incarnation of Shiva.
If Lakshmi, the temple elephant, and her attendant are around, she’ll smooch (bless) you for a coin; she gets her morning bath at 8am down by the river ghats.
To the south, overlooking Virupaksha Temple, Hemakuta Hill has a few early ruins, including monolithic sculptures of Narasimha (Vishnu in his man- lion incarnation) and Ganesha. At the east end of the recently abandonded Hampi Bazaar is a monolithic Nandi statue, around which stand colonnaded blocks of the ancient marketplace. Overlooking the site is Matanga Hill, whose summit affords dramatic views of the terrain at sunrise.
Within the now-derelict bazaar is the Hampi Heritage Gallery (

 ; Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, child under 15 free; h8.30am-5.30pm)
The undisputed highlight of the Hampi ruins, the 16th-century Vittala Temple stands amid the boulders 2km from Hampi Bazaar. Work possibly started on the temple during the reign of Krishnadevaraya (r 1509–29). It was never finished or consecrated, yet the temple’s incredible sculptural work remains the pinnacle of Vijayanagar art.
The ornate stone chariot that stands in the courtyard is the temple’s showpiece and represents Vishnu’s vehicle with an image of Garuda within. Its wheels were once capable of turning.
The outer ‘musical’ pillars reverberate when tapped. They were supposedly designed to replicate 81 different Indian instruments, but authorities have placed them out of tourists’ bounds for fear of further damage, so no more do-re-mi.
As well as the main temple, whose sanctum was illuminated using a design of reflective waters, you’ll find the marriage hall and prayer hall, the structures to the left and right upon entry, respectively.

Halfway along the path from Hampi Bazaar to Vittala Temple, a track to theright leads over the rocks to deserted Sule Bazaar, one of ancient Hampi’s principle centres of commerce and reputedly its red-light district. At the southern end of this area is the beautiful 16th-century Achyutaraya Temple (

 ).
HAMPI RUINS TICKET
The ₹250 ticket for Vittala Temple entitles you to same-day admission into most of the paid sites across the ruins (including around the Royal Centre and the Archaeological Museum), so don’t lose your ticket.
Royal Centre & Around
While it can be accessed by a 2km foot trail from the Achyutaraya Temple, the Royal Centre is best reached via the Hampi–Kamalapuram road. A number of Hampi’s major sites stand here.

The Mahanavami-diiba is a 12m-high three-tiered platform with intricate carvings and panoramic vistas of the walled complex of ruined temples, stepped tanks and the King’s audience hall. The platform was used as a Royal viewing area for the Dasara festivities, religious ceremonies and processions.

DEMOLISHMENT OF HAMPI BAZAAR
While in 1865 it was the Deccan sultanates who levelled Vijayanagar, today a different battle rages in Hampi, between conservationists bent on protecting Hampi’s architectural heritage and the locals who have settled there.
In mid-2012 the government’s master plan that had been in the works since the mid- 2000s, and which aims to classify all of Hampi’s ruins as protected monuments, was dramatically and forcefully put into action. Overnight shops, hotels and homes in Hampi Bazaar were bulldozed, reducing the atmospheric main strip to rubble overnight, as villagers who’d made the site a living monument were evicted.
While villagers were compensated with a small plot of land in Kaddirampur, 4km from the bazaar (where there is talk of new guesthouses eventually opening up), many locals remain displaced years later as they await their pay out.
While at the time of research, rubble from the demolished buildings remained, iconic hang-outs had been destroyed (including riverside restaurants such as the Mango Tree) and the main temple road resembled a bombed-out town; guesthouses and restaurants on the fringes of the bazaar remain intact.2 Activities
Hampi Waterfalls
WATERFALL
 
About a 2km walk west of Hampi Bazaar, past shady banana plantations, you can scramble over the boulders to reach the attractive Hampi ‘waterfalls,’ a series of small whirlpools among the rocks amid superb scenery.
Bouldering & Rock Climbing
Hampi is the undisputed bouldering capital of India. The entire landscape is a climber’s adventure playground made of granite crags and boulders, some bearing the marks of ancient stonemasons. Golden Boulders (2013) by Gerald Krug and Christiane Hupe has a ton of info on bouldering in Hampi.

This dingy office inside Virupaksha Temple has brochures but is more useful for arranging cycling tours (per person ₹400 including bike and guide), walking guides (half-/full day ₹600/1000) and bus tours (₹350, seven hours), all of which head to the ruins.
8 Getting There & Away A semideluxe bus connects Hampi Bazaar to Bengaluru (₹550, eight hours) leaving at 8pm, but otherwise you’ll have to head to Hospet for onward travel. Travel agents in Hampi Bazaar can book tickets.
The first bus from Hospet (₹22, 30 minutes, half-hourly) is at 5.45am; the last one back leaves Hampi Bazaar at 7.30pm. An autorickshaw costs ₹150 to ₹200.
Hospet is Hampi’s nearest train station.
8 Getting Around Bicycles cost ₹30 per day in Hampi Bazaar, while mopeds can be hired for around ₹150. Petrol is ₹100 a litre.
A small boat (

Autorickshaws and taxis are available for sightseeing. Hiring an autorickshaw for the day costs ₹750.
Organised tours depart from Hospet and Hampi.
Around Hampi
Anegundi
Across the Tungabhadra River, about 5km northeast of Hampi Bazaar, sits Anegundi, an ancient fortified village that’s part of the Hampi World Heritage Site but predates Hampi by way of human habitation. Gifted with a landscape similar to Hampi, Anegundi has been spared the blight of commercialisation, and thus continues to preserve the local atmosphere minus the touristy vibe.

The whitewashed Hanuman Temple, accessible by a 570-step climb up the Anjanadri Hill, has fine views of the rugged terrain around. Many believe this is the birthplace of Hanuman, the Hindu monkey god who was Rama’s devotee and helped him in his mission against Ravana. The hike up is pleasant, though you’ll be courted by impish monkeys, and within the temple you’ll find a large group of chillum-puffing sadhus.Kishkinda Trust

About 30km south of Hampi, amid a scrubby undulated terrain, lies the Daroji Sloth Bear Sanctuary which nurses a population of around 150 free-ranging sloth bears in an area of 83 sq km. You have a very good chance of spotting them, as honey is slathered on the rocks to coincide with the arrival of visitors. However, you can only see them from afar at the viewing platform. Bring binoculars, or basically there’s no point turning up. Generally 4pm to 6pm is the best time to visit.
The sanctuary is also home to leopards, wild boars, hyenas, jackals and others animals, but you’re unlikely to see anything other than peacocks. You’ll need to arrange transport to get here, which should cost around ₹600 for an autorickshaw and ₹1000 for a car.

Badami
%08357 / Pop 26,000
Once the capital of the mighty Chalukya empire, today Badami is famous for its magnificent rock-cut cave temples, and red sandstone cliffs that resemble the Wild West. While the dusty main road is an eyesore that will have you wanting to get the hell out of there, its backstreets are a lovely area to explore with old houses, carved wooden doorways and the occasional Chalukyan ruin.
History From about AD 540 to 757, Badami was the capital of an enormous kingdom stretching from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu to the Narmada River in Gujarat. It eventually fell to the Rashtrakutas, and changed hands several times thereafter, with each dynasty sculpturally embellishing Badami in their own way.
The sculptural legacy left by the Chalukyan artisans in Badami includes some of the earliest and finest examples of Dravidian temples and rock-cut caves.
1 Sights & Activities The bluffs and horseshoe-shaped red sandstone cliff of Badami offer some great low-altitude climbing. For more information, visit www.indiaclimb.com.
Badami’s caves overlook the 5th-century Agastyatirtha Tank and the waterside Bhutanatha temples. On the other side of the tank is anarchaeological museum (admission ₹5; h9am-5pm Sat-Thu), which houses superb
examples of local sculpture, including a remarkably explicit Lajja-Gauri image of a fertility cult that once flourished in the area. The stairway behind the museum climbs through a sandstone chasm and fortified gateways to reach the ruins of the North Fort.
Cave Temples
(Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, video camera ₹25, tour guide ₹300; h6am-6pm)
CAVE
Badami’s highlights are its beautiful cave temples. Cave One, just above the entrance to the complex, is dedicated to Shiva. It’s the oldest of the four caves, probably carved in the latter half of the 6th century. On the wall to the right of the porch is a captivating image of Nataraja striking 81 dance moves in the one pose. On the right of the porch area is a huge figure of Ardhanarishvara. On the opposite wall is a large image of Harihara, half Shiva and half Vishnu.
Dedicated to Vishnu, Cave Two is simpler in design. As with caves one and three, the front edge of the platform is decorated with images of pot-bellied dwarfs in various poses. Four pillars support the verandah, their tops carved with a bracket in the shape of a yali (mythical lion creature). On the left wall of the porch is the bull-headed figure of Varaha, the emblem of the Chalukya empire. To his left is Naga, a snake with a human face. On the right wall is a large sculpture of Trivikrama, another incarnation of Vishnu.
Between the second and third caves are two sets of steps to the right. The first leads to a natural cave with a small image of Padmapani (an incarnation of the Buddha). The second set of steps – sadly, barred by a gate – leads to the hilltop South Fort.
Cave Three, carved in AD 578, is the largest and most impressive. On the left wall is a carving of Vishnu, to whom the cave is dedicated, sitting on a snake. Nearby is an image of Varaha with four hands. The pillars have carved brackets in the shape of yalis. The ceiling panels contain images, including Indra riding an elephant, Shiva on a bull and Brahma on a swan. Keep an eye out for the image of drunken revellers, in particular one lady being propped up by her husband. There’s also original colour on the ceiling; the divots on the floor at the cave’s entrance were used as paint palettes.Dedicated to Jainism, Cave Four is the smallest of the set and dates between the 7th and 8th centuries. The right wall has an image of Suparshvanatha (the seventh Jain tirthankar) surrounded by 24 Jain tirthankars. The inner sanctum contains an image of Adinath, the first Jain tirthankar.

8 Getting There & Away Buses regularly shuffle off from Badami’s bus stand on Station Rd to Kerur (₹25, 45 minutes), which has connections to Bijapur and Hubli. Buses to Hospet (₹180, six hours) also leave from here.
Several trains run to Bijapur including the 11424 Solapur Express (₹70, 3½ hours, 5.30pm), while the Hubli Express goes to Hubli (2nd class ₹75, 3½ hours, 11am). For Bengaluru, take the 16536 Gol Gumbaz Express (2nd class ₹330, 13 hours, 7.15pm).
8 Getting Around Theoretically you can visit Aihole and Pattadakal in a day from Badami if you get moving early. It’s much easier and less stressful to arrange an autorickshaw or taxi for the day; it costs around ₹900/1500 for a day trip to Pattadakal, Aihole and nearby Mahakuta.
Start with Aihole (₹40, one hour), then move to Pattadakal (₹23, 30 minutes), and finally return to Badami (₹23, one hour). The last bus from Pattadakal to Badami is at 4pm.
Around Badami
There’s no accommodation or restaurants at either Pattadakal or Aihole.
Pattadakal
A secondary capital of the Badami Chalukyas, Pattadakal is known for its temples, which are collectively a World Heritage site.
Barring a few that date back to the 3rd century AD, most of Pattadakal’stemples (Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video camera ₹25; h6am-6pm) were built during the
7th and 8th centuries AD. Historians believe Pattadakal served as an important trial ground for the development of South Indian temple architecture. A guide here costs about ₹250.
The main Virupaksha Temple is a massive structure, its columns covered with intricate carvings depicting episodes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata. A giant stone sculpture of Nandi (Shiva’s bull) sits to the temple’s east. The Mallikarjuna Temple, next to the Virupaksha Temple, is almost identical in design. About 500m south of the main enclosure is the Jain Papanatha Temple, its entrance flanked by elephant sculptures.
Pattadakal is 20km from Badami, with buses (₹23) departing every 30 minutes until about 5pm. There’s a morning and afternoon bus to Aiole (₹20), 13km away.
Aihole
Some 100 temples, built between the 4th and 6th centuries AD, speck the ancient Chalukyan regional capital of Aihole (ay-ho-leh). Most, however, are either in ruins or engulfed by the modern village. Aihole documents the embryonic stage of South Indian Hindu architecture, from the earliest simple shrines, such as the most ancient Ladkhan Temple, to the later and more complex buildings, such as the Meguti Temple.
The most impressive of all the temples in Aihole is the 7th-century Durga
Temple (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, camera ₹25; h8am-6pm), notable for its semicircular
apse (inspired by Buddhist architecture) and the remains of the curvilinear sikhara (temple spire). The interiors house intricate stone carvings. The small
museum (admission ₹5; h9am-5pm Sat-Thu) behind the temple contains further
examples of Chalukyan sculpture.
To the south of the Durga Temple are several other temple clusters, including early examples. About 600m to the southeast, on a low hillock, is the Jain Meguti Temple. Watch out for snakes if you’re venturing up.
Aihole is about 40km from Badami and 13km from Pattadakal.Bijapur (Vijapura)

A fascinating open-air museum dating back to the Deccan’s Islamic era, dusty Bijapur (renamed Vijapura in 2014) tells a glorious tale dating back some 600 years. Blessed with a heap of mosques, mausoleums, palaces and fortifications, it was the capital of the Adil Shahi kings from 1489 to 1686, and one of the five splinter states formed after the Islamic Bahmani kingdom broke up in 1482. Despite its strong Islamic character, Bijapur is also a centre for the Lingayat brand of Shaivism, which emphasises a single personalised god. The Lingayat Siddeshwara Festival runs for eight days in January/February.

MONUMENT

GOOGLE MAP
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, camera ₹25; h6am-6pm)
Set in tranquil gardens, the magnificent Golgumbaz mausoleum houses the tombs of emperor Mohammed Adil Shah (r 1627–56), his two wives, his mistress (Rambha), one of his daughters and a grandson. Octagonal seven-storey towers stand at each corner of the monument, which is capped by an enormous dome. An astounding 38m in diameter, it’s said to be the largest dome in the world after St Peter’s Basilica in Rome.
Climb the steep, narrow stairs up one of the towers to reach the ‘whispering gallery’ within the dome. An engineering marvel, its acoustics are such that if you whisper into the wall, a person on the opposite side of the gallery can hear you clearly. Unfortunately people like to test this out by hollering (its unnerving acoustics have the nightmarish effect of a bad acid trip).
There’s also the archaeological museum (

carpets, china crockery, weapons and scrolls dating back to Bijapur’s heyday.

MONUMENT

 ; Indian/foreigner ₹5/100, video ₹25; h6am-6pm)
The beautiful Ibrahim Rouza is among the most elegant and finely proportioned Islamic monuments in India. Its 24m-high minarets are said to have inspired those of the Taj Mahal, and its tale is similarly poignant: built by emperor Ibrahim Adil Shah II (r 1580–1627) as a future mausoleum for his queen, Taj Sultana. Ironically, he died before her, and was thus the first person to be rested there. Also interred here with Ibrahim Adil Shah are his queen, children and mother.
For a tip (₹150 is fine), caretakers can show you around the monument, including the dark labyrinth around the catacomb where the actual graves are located.

These include the Rangin Mahal (Painted Palace), with elaborate tilework, teak pillars and panels with mother-of-pearl inlay, Solah Khamba Mosque (Sixteen-Pillared Mosque), and Tarkash Mahal with exquisitive Islamic inscriptions and wonderful rooftop views.

History From the 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD the Satavahana empire, also known as the Andhras, ruled over much of the Deccan plateau from a base in this region. The Satavahanas helped Buddhism to flourish after it arrived with emperor Ashoka's missionary monks, and today Andhra Pradesh has more ancient Buddhist sites than almost any other Indian state.
The Hindu Kakatiyas, based at Warangal, ruled most of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh from the 12th to 14th centuries, a period that saw the rise of Telugu culture and language. Warangal eventually fell to the Muslim Delhi Sultanate and then passed to the Deccan-based Bahmani Sultanate. Then, in 1518, the Bahmanis' governor at Golconda, Sultan Quli Qutb Shah, claimed independence. His Qutb Shahi dynasty developed Golconda into the massive fortress we see today. But a water shortage there caused Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah to relocate a few kilometres east to the south bank of the Musi River, where he founded the new city of Hyderabad in 1591.
The Qutb Shahis were ousted by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1687. When the Mughal empire in turn started fraying at the edges, its local viceroy Nizam ul-Mulk Asaf Jah took control of much of the Deccan, launching Hyderabad's second great Muslim dynasty, the Asaf Jahis – the famously fabulously wealthy nizams of Hyderabad – in 1724. His capital was Aurangabad, but his son Asaf Jah II moved to Hyderabad in 1763. Hyderabad rose to become the centre of Islamic India and a focus for the arts, culture and learning. Its abundance of rare gems and minerals – the world-famous Kohinoor diamond is from here – furnished the nizams with enormous wealth.
The whole region was effectively under British control from around 1800, but while Andhra Pradesh was governed from Madras (now Chennai), the princely state of Hyderabad – which included large territories outside the city populated by Telugu-speaking Hindus – remained nominally independent Come Indianby Telugu-speaking Hindus – remained nominally independent. Come Indian Independence in 1947, nizam Osman Ali Khan wanted to retain sovereignty, but Indian military intervention saw Hyderabad state join the Indian union in 1948.
When Indian states were reorganised along linguistic lines in 1956, Hyderabad was split three ways. What's now Telangana joined other Telugu- speaking areas to form Andhra Pradesh state; other districts became parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra. Telangana was never completely happy with this arrangement, and after prolonged campaigning, it was split off from Andhra Pradesh as a separate state in 2014. Hyderabad remains capital of both states until Andhra Pradesh gets its new capital at Vijayawada up and running, with a time limit of 10 years.
TOP STATE FESTIVALS
Sankranti (Jan; regionwide) This important Telugu festival marks the end of harvest season. Kite-flying abounds, doorsteps are decorated with colourful kolams (rice-flour designs) and men adorn cattle with bells and fresh horn paint. Brahmotsavam (Venkateshwara Temple, Tirumala; hSep/Oct) This nine-day festival sees the Venkateshwara temple at Tirumala awash in vast crowds of worshippers. Special pujas and chariot processions are held, and it’s an auspicious time for darshan (deity-viewing). Muharram (Hyderabad; hSep/Oct) Commemorates the martyrdom of Mohammed’s grandson Hussain. A huge procession throngs the Old City in Hyderabad.
HYDERABAD
%040 / Pop 6.81 million
The Old City of Hyderabad is everything you might dream an Indian old city to be – narrow lanes thronged with markets, chai shops, wandering animals, autorickshaws, a whirl of noise, colour, languages and religions dotted with stately old architecture in varying states of repair. Two unbelievably wealthy Muslim royal houses, the Qutb Shahs and the Asaf Jahs, came and went from this city of pearls and diamonds, leaving a legacy of magnificent palaces, mosques and tombs, and a majority population in poverty.
Hyderabad's other pole is far younger – its Hi-Tech City, or 'Cyberabad', out west, which since the 1990s has propelled the city into the modern world with its accoutrements of glittery malls, multiplexes, clubs, pubs and sleek restaurants toaccout e   e ts o  g  tte y    a  s,    u t p e es, c ubs, pubs a d s ee   estau a ts to sit alongside the traditional biryani joints and teahouses.
Between the old and the new lie, in both material and geographical terms, dense inner city areas like Abids, north of the Old City, and leafy middle-class areas like Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills. In the northeast, site of one of Hyderabad's three main train stations, is Secunderabad, the former British military cantonment still referred to as Hyderabad's 'twin city', though they are effectively one now.
One thing you have to accept wherever you are in Hyderabad: the traffic is appalling. Happily a new Metro Rail rapid transit system, coming on stream as we speak, should ease things.
Hyderabad's Muslim population (Urdu-speaking) is concentrated mostly in the Old City and nearby areas north of the Musi River. The majority of the population are Telugu-speaking Hindus and there's also a growing number of migrants from other parts of India attracted by the IT boom.1 SightsOld City

Hyderabad’s principal landmark and city symbol was built by Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 to commemorate the founding of Hyderabad and the end of epidemics caused by Golconda’s water shortage. The beautiful four-column,
56m-high structure has four arches facing the cardinal points, with minarets atop each column (hence the name Charminar, 'four minarets'). It stands at the heart of Hyderabad's most atmospheric area (also known as Charminar), a labyrinth of lanes crowded with shops, stalls, markets and shoppers.
The Charminar's second floor, home to Hyderabad’s oldest mosque, and the upper columns, are not open to the public. The structure is illuminated from 7pm to 9pm.

This opulent 18th-and-19th-century palace, the main residence of several nizams, comprises four garden courtyards in a line from north to south. Most dazzling is the Khilwat Mubarak at the end of the first courtyard, a magnificent durbar hall where nizams held ceremonies under 19 enormous chandeliers of Belgian crystal. Its side rooms today house photos and historical exhibits extolling the nizams' virtues. Its balcony once served as seating for the royal women, who attended durbars in purdah.
Several other halls contain interesting exhibits of nizams' personal possessions, arts, crafts and costumes, and in the southernmost courtyard you'll find a 1911 yellow Rolls-Royce which was preserved for very special occasions and has travelled only 356 miles in more than a century.

The 40-plus galleries include early South Indian bronzes and wood and stone sculptures, Indian miniature paintings, European fine art, historic manuscripts, a room of jade and another room of very fancy walking sticks.

This mosque is one of the world’s largest, with 10,000 men praying here at major Muslim festivals, and also one of Hyderabad's oldest buildings, begun in 1617 by the city's founder Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah. Women are not allowed inside the main prayer hall, and male tourists are unlikely to be let in either (they can look through the railings). Female tourists, even with headscarves, may not even be allowed into the vast courtyard if their clothing is judged too skimpy or tight.
Several bricks embedded above the prayer hall's central arch are made with soil from Mecca, hence the mosque's name. An enclosure alongside the courtyard contains the tombs of several Hyderabad nizams.Badshahi Ashurkhana

The 1594 Badshahi Ashurkhana (literally 'royal house of mourning') was one of the first structures built by the Qutb Shahs in their new city of Hyderabad. In a courtyard set back from the road, its walls are practically glowing with intricate, brightly coloured tile mosaics. The Ashurkhana is packed during Muharram, as well as on Thursdays, when local Shiites gather to commemorate the martyrdom of Hussain Ibn Ali. Visitors should remove shoes and dress modestly (including a headscarf for women).Abids Area1 Sights

 ; Koti)
This palatial Palladian residence, built in 1803-06 by James Achilles Kirkpatrick, the British Resident (official East India Company representative) in Hyderabad, features in William Dalrymple's brilliant historical love story White Mughals. It's sadly dilapidated today, though long-mooted restoration plans may at last be coming to fruition. If you enter the grounds a caretaker will probably offer to open up the grand original building (tip ₹50 to ₹100 when you've finished).
Kirkpatrick became enchanted by Hyderabad courtly culture, converted to Islam and married Khair-un-Nissa, a teenage relative of the Hyderabad primeminister. The Residency and its extensive gardens became the Osmania University College for Women, known as Koti Women's College, in 1949. Inside the grand classical portico, you can admire the Durbar Hall, with Islamic geometric designs on its high ceiling above the chandeliers and classical columns, and the elaborate curving staircase behind. In the overgrown gardens to the southwest you'll find a British cemetery and, if you're lucky, the surviving entrance to the Residency's zenana (women's quarters) and a model of the Residency building made by Kirkpatrick for Khair-un-Nissa – though our guide refused to venture beyond the cemetery for fear of snakes.

It was the Qutb Shahs in the 16th century who made Golconda into the massive fortress whose substantial ruins we see today. The mighty citadel is built on a 120m-high granite hill, surrounded by crenellated ramparts of large masonry blocks, with another ring of crenellated ramparts, 11km in perimeter, outside it. Morning visits are best for relative peace and quiet.
By the time of the Qutb Shahs, Golconda fort had already existed for at least three centuries under the Kakatiyas and Bahmani sultanate, and was already famed for its diamonds, which were mostly mined in the Krishna River valley, but cut and traded here. The Qutb Shahs moved to their new city of Hyderabad in 1591, but maintained Golconda as a citadel until the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb took it in 1687 after a year-long siege, ending Qutb Shahi rule.
Golconda's massive gates were studded with iron spikes to obstruct war elephants. Within the fort, a series of concealed glazed earthenware pipes ensured a reliable water supply, while the ingenious acoustics guaranteed that even the smallest sound from the entrance would echo across the fort complex.
Guides charge at least ₹600 per 90-minute tour. Small ₹20 guide booklets are also available. Inside the citadel gate, an anticlockwise circuit leads through gardens and up past mostly minor buildings to the top of the hill, where you'll find the functioning Hindu Jagadamba Mahakali Temple and the three-storey durbar hall, with fine panoramas. You then descend to the old palace buildings in the southeastern part of the fort and return to the entrance passing the elegant three-arched Taramati Mosque.
Golconda is about 10km west from Abids or the Charminar: autorickshaws charge around ₹400 return, including waiting. Buses 65G and 66G run from Charminar bus stop to Golconda via GPO Abids hourly; the journey takes about an hour. Bus 142K goes from Koti bus stop via GPO Abids about every 90 minutes.

Seven of the eight Qutb Shahi rulers were buried here, as well as family members and a few physicians, courtesans and other favourites. An exhibition near the entrance provides helpful explanatory information.
The tombs' great domes are mounted on cubical bases, many of which have beautiful colonnades and delicate lime stucco ornamentation. You could easily spend half a day taking photos and wandering in and out of the mausoleums. Among the finest is that of Mohammed Quli, the founder of Hyderabad, standing 42m tall on a platform near the edge of the complex, with views back towards Golconda.
The tombs are an easy walk from Golconda, or about ₹30 by autorickshaw. Infrequent buses 80S and 142K also link the two places.

The Paigahs’ necropolis, in a quiet neighbourhood 4km southeast of Charminar, is a small compound of exquisite mausoleums made of marble and lime stucco. It's signposted down a small lane opposite Owaisi Hospital on the Inner Ring Rd.
The complex contains 27 carved-marble tombs in enclosures with delicately carved walls and pillars, stunning geometrically patterned filigree screens and, overhead, tall, graceful turrets. At the western end a handsome mosque is reflected in its large ablutions pool.

The dargah'sbe a handprint of Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammed. The dargah's reputed healing properties make it a pilgrimage site for the sick.
Visitors are normally allowed inside the dargah, which is covered in thousands of tiny mirrors, only during the three-day Moula Ali urs festival during Muharram, but you can admire them it outside at other times.

Hyderabadis and visitors of every stripe flock to the Charminar area's labyrinthine lanes to browse, buy and wander. Patthargatti, the broad avenue leading in from the Musi River, is lined with shops selling clothes (especially wedding outfits), perfumes and
Hyderabad's famous pearls. Laad Bazar ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), running west from
the Charminar, is famed for its sparkling bangle shops: lac bangles, made from a resinous insect secretion and encrusted with colourful beads or stones, are a Hyderabad speciality. In Laad Bazar you'll also find perfumers, wedding goods and fabrics.
Laad Bazar opens into Mehboob Chowk ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), a square with a
19th-century clock tower and mosque, shops selling antiquarian books and antiques, a livestock market on its south side, and a market in exotic birds, Chiddi Bazar (

 ), just southwest.
A short distance north, the Patel Market ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), selling cloth
fabrics, cranks into action from around 11am in the back lanes between Patthargatti and Rikab Gunj. Further north again and on the other side of Patthargatti, the wholesale
vegetable market Mir Alam Mandi ( 
stuff from 6.30am to 6.30pm daily.

 ) trades in all kinds of fresh
5 Eating In the early evenings, look out for mirchi bhajji (chilli fritters), served at street stalls with tea. The Hyderabadi style is famous: chillis are stripped of their seeds, stuffed with tamarind, sesame and spices, dipped in chickpea batter and fried.
Per local usage, we use the term ‘meal’ instead of ‘thali’.

The classic dunk is Osmania biscuits (melt-in-the-mouth shortbreads). Nimrah also offers dil khush ('happy heart') and dil pasand, types of pie/pastry with sweet coconut-y fillings, and more.

HYDERABAD CUISINE
Hyderabad has a food culture all its own and Hyderabadis take great pride and pleasure in it. It was the Mughals who brought the tasty biryanis, skewer kebabs and haleem (a thick Ramadan soup of pounded, spiced wheat with goat, chicken or beef, and lentils). Mutton (goat or lamb) is the classic biryani base, though chicken, egg and vegetable biryanis are plentiful too. Biryanis come in vast quantity and one serve may satisfy two people.
If you’re in Hyderabad during Ramadan (known locally as Ramzan), look out for the clay ovens called bhattis. You’ll probably hear them before you see them. Men gather around, taking turns to vigorously pound haleem inside purpose-built structures. Come nightfall, the serious business of eating begins. The taste is worth the wait.
Andhra cuisine, found in Telangana as well as Andhra Pradesh, is more curry-and pilau- based, often with coconut and/or cashew flavours, and famous across India for its delicious spicy hotness. Vegetarians are well catered for, but you'll find plenty of fish, seafood and meat dishes too.

near Abids. Air-con services by the TSRTC (http://tsrtcbus.in) are quite good; for Karnataka, go with KSRTC near platform 30. Many long-distance services depart in the evening. When booking ahead, women should request seats up front as these are reserved for women.
Secunderabad’s Jubilee bus station (

smaller; frequent city buses run here from St Mary's Rd near Secunderabad station. Useful routes from here include: A Bengaluru (ordinary/Volvo AC/sleeper ₹610/1000/1600, 10 to 12 hours, seven daily) A Vijayawada (non- AC/AC ₹310/450, five to seven hours, 11 daily) A Mumbai ('express' ₹600, 14 hours, 2pm) TRAIN
A Secunderabad, Nampally (officially called Hyderabad Deccan), and Kacheguda are Hyderabad's three major train stations. Most through trains stop at Kacheguda.
The reservation complexes at Nampally (

St John's Rd; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, 8am-2pm Sun), both in separate buildings away from the
stations, have foreign-tourist-quota counters (bring passport and visa photocopies, along with originals). For inquiries and PNR status, phone 139.
There are around 20 trains a day each to Warangal (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹170/535/735, 2½ hours) and Vijayawada (₹190/495/720, six hours), mostly from Secunderabad.8 Getting Around
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
Bus
The TSRTC's Pushpak air-conditioned bus service runs between about 4am and
11pm to and from various stops in the city, including AC Guards (

GOOGLE MAP

GOOGLE MAP
 ) (₹200, two or three buses hourly) and Secretariat ( 
 ) (₹200, about hourly), both about 1.5km from Abids, ParyatakBhavan ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) on Greenlands Rd (₹250, about hourly), and
Secunderabad ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) (₹250, twice hourly). The trip takes
about one hour. Contact TSRTC (Telangana State Road Transport Corporation; %1800
2004599; http://tsrtcbus.in) or check http://hyderabad.aero for timings.
Taxi
The prepaid taxi booth is on the lowest level of the terminal; ignore touts on the way down. Fares to Abids or Banjara Hills are ₹600 to ₹700. Meru Cabs (%44224422) and Sky Cabs (%49494949) ‘radio taxis’, with counters in the arrivals area, charge ₹21 per kilometre (₹26 at night), which works out much the same. Meru and Sky also provide reliable service for trips within the citry.
AUTORICKSHAW
Official fares are ₹20 for the first 1.6km, then ₹11 for each additional kilometre, with a 50% surcharge between 11pm and 5am. But most drivers won't use their meters so you must negotiate and will probably end up paying ₹20 to ₹25 per kilometre (more after dark).
BUS
City buses (₹6 to ₹12 for most rides) run everywhere but you'll usually need local help in finding the right stop and right bus; www.hyderabadbusroutes.com gives routes with some stops mapped, but can be inaccurate.CAR
Arrange car hire through your hotel. The going rate for a small air-con car such as an Indica, with a driver, is ₹1000 to ₹1200 per day for city sightseeing (eight hours/80km maximum), and ₹2800 to ₹3200 per day for out-of-town trips (up to 300km).
METRO RAIL
Hyderabad Metro Rail (http://hmr.gov.in), a 72km rapid transit network being phased into operation between 2015 and 2017, will make getting around the city a whole lot easier. Trains will run on elevated tracks above Hyderabad's streets, with 66 stations on three lines.
TRAIN
MMTS suburban trains (www.mmtstraintimings.in; fares ₹5-11) are convenient for the
three main stations, but infrequent (every 30 to 45 minutes). There are two routes: Hyderabad (Nampally) to Lingampalli (northwest of Banjara Hills) stops at Necklace Rd, Begumpet and Hi-Tech City; Falaknuma (south of Old City) to Lingampalli stops at Kacheguda and Secunderabad stations and joins the Hyderabad–Lingampalli line at Begumpet.TELANGANA
The most interesting spots to visit in the newly created state of Telangana, outside its capital Hyderabad, lie in and around the state's second city, Warangal.
Bhongir
Most Hyderabad–Warangal buses and trains stop at Bhongir, 60km from Hyderabad. It’s worth stopping to climb the fantastical-looking 12th-century
Chalukyan hill fort (admission ₹3, camera ₹10; h10am-5pm), sitting on what resembles
a gargantuan stone egg right above the bus station. You can leave backpacks at the ticket office.
Warangal
%0870 / Pop 620,000
Warangal was the capital of the Kakatiya kingdom, which ruled most of present- day Telangana and Andhra Pradesh from the 12th to early 14th centuries.

Fort
FORT
 
Warangal’s fort, on the southern edge of town, was a massive construction with three circles of walls (the outermost 7km around). Most of it is now either fields or buildings, but at the centre is a huge, partly reassembled Shaivite
Svayambhu Temple (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h9am-6pm), with handsome, large
torana gateways at its cardinal points. An autorickshaw from Warangal station costs around ₹300 return.
The ticket also covers the Kush Mahal (Shitab Khan Mahal), a 16th-century royal hall 400m west. Almost opposite the Svayambhu entrance is a park(admission ₹10; h7am-7pm) containing the high rock Ekashila Gutta which is topped by another Kakatiya temple overlooking a small lake.
1000-Pillared Temple
(h6am-6pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
Six kilometres northwest of Warangal station in the adjoining town of Hanumakonda (Hanamkonda), the 1000-Pillared Temple, constructed in 1163, is a fine example of Kakatiya architecture and sculpture, in a leafy setting. Unusually, the cross-shaped building has shrines to the sun god Surya (to the right as you enter), Vishnu (centre) and Shiva (left). Despite the name, it certainly does not have 1000 pillars. Behind rises Hanumakonda Hill, site of the original Kakatiya capital before they moved down the road to Warangal.
Other ancient temples in Hanumakonda include the lakeside Bhadrakali Temple, 2km southeast of the 1000-Pillared Temple, whose idol of the mother goddess Kali sits with a weapon in each of her eight hands, and the small Siddeshwara Temple on the south side of Hanumakonda Hill.

Vijayawada
%0866 / Pop 1.05 million
Centrally located in the new Andhra Pradesh, the commercial and industrial city of Vijayawada, on the north bank of the Krishna River, is to be Andhra's new capital. The state government has ambitious plans to construct a showpiece capital complex encompassing 17 existing villages on the south side of the river, at a cost of over 1 trillion rupees (US$16 billion).
Vijayawada is a good base for visiting some fascinating old Buddhist sites in the lush and green surrounding area. The city is considered by many to be the heart of Andhra culture and language, and its 12th-century Kanaka Durga Temple (Durga Temple Ghat Rd, Indrakeeladri Hill) draws many pilgrims. The 1.3km-long Prakasam Barrage across the Krishna here feeds three irrigation canals which run through the city like canals.

Just 6km southwest of downtown Vijayawada, on the south side of the Krishna River, this stunning four-storey cave temple was probably originally carved out of the hillside for Buddhist monks in the 2nd century AD, then converted toHindu use in the 7th century. The shrines are now empty except those on the third level, one of which houses a huge reclining Vishnu. Three gnome-like stone Vasihnavite gurus or preachers gaze out over the rice paddies from the terrace.

STATE OF GOOD KARMA
Lying at a nexus of major Indian land routes and sea routes across the Bay of Bengal, Andhra Pradesh played an important role in the early history of Buddhism. Andhra and Telangana have about 150 known Buddhist stupas, monasteries, caves and other sites. They speak of a time when Andhra Pradesh, or 'Andhradesa', was a hotbed of Buddhist activity, when Indian monks set off for Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia to spread theBuddha's teachings, and monks came from far and wide to learn from renowned Buddhist teachers.
Andhradesa's Buddhist culture lasted around 1500 years from the Buddha's own lifetime in the 6th century BC. The dharma really took off in the 3rd century BC under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, who dispatched monks across his empire to teach and construct stupas enshrining relics of the Buddha. (Being near these was thought to help progress on the path to enlightenment.) After Ashoka's death in 232 BC, succeeding rulers of central Andhra Pradesh, the Satavahanas and then the Ikshvakus, continued to support Buddhism. At their capital Amaravathi, the Satavahanas adorned Ashoka’s stupa with elegant decoration. They built monasteries across the Krishna Valley and exported the dharma through their sophisticated maritime network. It was under Satavahana rule that Nagarjuna, considered the progenitor of Mahayana Buddhism, is believed to have lived, in the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD. The monk, equal parts logician, philosopher and meditator, wrote several ground-breaking works that shaped Buddhist thought.
Today, even in ruins, you can get a sense of how large some of the stupas were, how expansive the monastic complexes, and of how the monks lived, sleeping in caves and fetching rainwater from stone-cut cisterns. Many of the sites have stunning views across seascapes or countryside. The complexes at Nagarjunakonda and Amaravathi have good infrastructure and helpful museums on-site. For a bit more adventure, head out from Vijayawada to Guntupalli or Bhattiprolu, or from Visakhapatnam to Thotlakonda, Bavikonda and Sankaram.
Around Vijayawada
Amaravathi
Amaravathi, 43km west of Vijayawada, was the earliest centre of Buddhism in the southern half of India. India’s biggest stupa (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h7am-7pm), 27m high and 49m across, was constructed here in the 3rd century BC. Amaravathi flourished as a capital of the Satavahana kingdom which ruled from Andhra across the Deccan for four or five centuries, becoming the fountainhead of Buddhist art in South India. All that remains of the stupa now are its circular base and a few parts of the surrounding stone railing. The great hemispherical dome is gone – but the next-door museum (admission ₹5; h9am-5pm Sat-Thu) has a model of the stupa and some of the intricate marble carvings depicting the Buddha's life with which the Satavahanas covered and surrounded it. A section of reconstructed stone railing gives you an idea of the stupa’s massive scale.About 1km away, on the edge of town, is the 20m-high Dhyana Buddha statue, erected on the site where the Dalai Lama spoke in 2006.
Bus 301 from Vijayawada bus station runs to Amaravathi (₹60, two hours) every 20 minutes, via Unduvalli, through some lovely countryside.
Eluru
The city of Eluru, 60km east of Vijayawada on the road and railway to Visakhapatnam, is the jumping-off point for the remote old Buddhist site of Guntupalli and the Dhamma Vijaya meditation centre at Vijayarai. Buses depart Eluru for Vijayarai (₹15, 20 minutes) half-hourly.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
GUNTUPALLI
Getting here is a very scenic adventure. The former Buddhist monastic compound (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h10am-5pm), high on a hilltop overlooking a vast expanse of forest and paddy fields, is specially noteworthy for its circular rock-cut chaitya-griha shrine. The cave’s domed ceiling is carved with ‘wooden beams’ designed to look like those in a hut. The chaitya-griha has a well-preserved stupa and, like the monks' dwellings lining the same cliff, a gorgeous arched facade also designed to look like wood. Check out the stone 'beds' in the monks’ cells, and the compound’s 60-plus votive stupas. The monastery was active from the 2nd century BC to 3rd century AD.
From Eluru, on the Vijayawada–Visakhapatnam road and railway, take a bus 35km north to Kamavarapukota (₹35, one hour, half-hourly), then a local bus or autorickshaw 10km west to Guntupalli. A taxi from Eluru costs around ₹1500 return.
Nagarjunakonda
A road trip of about 180km west from Vijayawada or 170km southeast fromHyderabad, followed by a 45-minute boat trip over Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir, brings you to the unique island of Nagarjunakonda, peppered with ancient Buddhist structures. Until 1960, when the big Nagarjunasagar Dam was built on the Krishna River, the island was the top of a hill in the Krishna valley. The Ikshvaku Dynasty had its capital here in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, when the area was probably the most important Buddhist centre in South India, with some 30 monasteries nearby. Excavations in the 1950s, in anticipation of the dam, unearthed stupas, viharas (monasteries), chaitya-grihas (prayer halls with stupas), mandapas (pillared pavilions) and many outstanding white-marble sculptures. The finds were reassembled on Nagarjunakonda.

Public buses from Hyderabad's Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station run hourly to Hill Colony/Nagarjuna Sagar (₹200, four hours): alight at Pylon and catch an autorickshaw (₹15/100 shared/private) 8km to Vijayapuri South.
Boats (₹100 return) depart for the island from Vijayapuri South, 7km south of the dam, theoretically at 9.30am, 11.30am and 1.30pm, and stay for one or two hours. The first two boats may not go if not enough people turn up, but the
1.30pm boat goes every day and starts back from the island at 4.30pm.Visakhapatnam
%0891 / Pop 1.73 million
Visit Visakhapatnam – also called Vizag (vie-zag) – during the December-to- February holiday season and you’ll see domestic tourism in rare form: balloons, fairy floss (cotton candy) and, of course, weddings. This is where Andhra Pradesh comes to have fun by the sea, and the crowds only enhance the area’s kitschy atmosphere. The pedestrian promenade along Ramakrishna Beach has spunk, nearby Rushikonda beach is Andhra’s best, and the surrounding area contains one of Andhra's most important Hindu temples, several ancient Buddhist sites, and the rural Araku Valley.
The beach-resort vibe exists despite the fact that Vizag is Andhra Pradesh’s largest city, famous for steel and its big port.
If you visit in mid-January you may coincide with Visakha Utsav , an annual festival with food stalls on Ramakrishna Beach, exhibitions and cultural events.

Bojjannakonda, the eastern part, has a pair of rock-cut shrines with several gorgeous carvings of the Buddha inside and outside. Above sit the ruins of a huge stupa and a monastery. Lingalakonda, at the western end, is piled with tiers of rock-cut stupas, some of them enormous. Both parts afford fabulous views over the surrounding rice paddies.
A car from Vizag costs around ₹1400. Or take a bus (₹42, 1½ hours, every half-hour from the RTC Complex) or train (₹35, one hour) to Anakapalle, 3km away, and then an autorickshaw (₹120 return including waiting).Bavikonda & Thotlakonda
Bavikonda (h9am-5pm) and Thotlakonda (pedestrian/car ₹5/30; h8am-5.30pm)
were Buddhist monasteries on scenic hilltop sites north of Vizag that each hosted
up to 150 monks, with the help of massive rainwater tanks. The site was
excavated in the 1980s and '90s.
The monasteries flourished from around the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century
AD, and had votive stupas, congregation halls, chaitya-grihas, viharas and
refectories. Thotlakonda has sea views, and Bavikonda has special importance
because a relic vessel found in its Mahachaitya stupa contained a piece of bone
believed to be from the Buddha himself.
Bavikonda and Thotlakonda are reached from turnoffs 14km and 15km,
respectively, from Vizag on Bheemunipatnam road: Bavikonda is 3km off the
main road and Thotlakonda 1.25km. Vizag autorickshaw drivers charge around
₹600 return to see both: you can also reach the turnoffs by shared autorickshaw
or bus 900K. An autorickshaw from the main road to Bavikonda and back costs
₹100 to ₹150.
Bheemunipatnam
This former Dutch settlement, 25km north of Vizag, is the oldest municipality in
mainland India, with bizarre sculptures on the beach, an 1861 lighthouse, an
interesting Dutch cemetery, and Bheemli Beach, where local grommets surf not-
very-clean waters on crude homemade boards. From Vizag, catch bus 900K or a
shared autorickshaw.
Araku Valley
%08936 / Elev 975m
Andhra’s best train ride is through the beautiful, lushly forested Eastern Ghats to the Araku Valley, centred on Araku town, 115km north of Vizag. The area is home to isolated tribal communities and known for its tasty organic coffee and lovely green countryside. The 58501 Visakhapatnam Kirandul Passenger train (₹30, four hours) leaves Vizag at 6.50am; train 58502 returns from Araku at2.50pm. Hourly buses from Vizag (₹70 to ₹105) take 4½ hours, and a taxi day trip costs between ₹3000 to ₹4000. The APTDC runs a variety of tours that all include a tribal dance performance and a visit to the million-year-old limestone
Borra Caves (adult/child ₹60/45, camera ₹100; h10am-1pm & 2-5pm), 38km before
Araku.
At Araku town, the Museum of Habitat (admission ₹10; h8am-1.30pm & 2.30-8pm),
next to the bus station and 2km east of the train station, has extensive exhibits on eastern Andhra Pradesh's tribal peoples, including mock-ups of hunting, ceremonial and other scenes. Next door, you can sample and buy local coffee and chocolate-covered coffee beans at Araku Valley Coffee House (coffee ₹25- 95; h8.30am-9pm), and browse tribal crafts at Araku Aadiwasi Arts & Crafts (h8am-8pm). On Fridays villagers crowd into Araku for the weekly market.
The oddly unfriendly Hotel Rajadhani (%249580; www.hotelrajadhani.com; r
without/with AC ₹800/1200; a), halfway between the train and bus stations, has clean, reasonably sized rooms and the Vasundhara Restaurant (h6am-11pm), serving good Indian meals. The APTDC has two decent hotels: Hill Resort
Mayuri (Mayuri; %249204; incl breakfast cottage ₹893, r ₹1349-2361; a) just behind the museum, and Valley Resort (%249202; r incl breakfast ₹1130-2030, with AC ₹2250; a),

Tirumala & Tirupati
Pop 287,000 (Tirupati), 7700 (Tirumala)
The holy hill of Tirumala is, on any given day, thronged with tens of thousands of blissed-out devotees, many of whom have made long journeys to see the powerful Lord Venkateshwara here, at his home. Around 60,000 pilgrims come each day, and darshan runs 24/7. The efficient Tirumala Tirupati
Devasthanams (TTD; %2277777, 2233333; www.tirumala.org) (TTD) brilliantly
administers the multitudes, employing 20,000 people to do so. Despite the crowds, a sense of order, serenity and ease mostly prevails, and a trip to the Holy Hill can be fulfilling, even if you’re not a pilgrim.
‘It is believed that Lord Sri Venkateshwara enjoys festivals’, according to theTTD. And so do his devotees: darshan queues during the annual nine-day Brahmotsavam festival (hlate Sep/early Oct) can run up to several kilometres.
Tirupati, the town at the bottom of the hill, has many hotels and restaurants and is the main transport nexus for Tirumala. You’ll find most of your worldly needs around the Tirupati bus station (TP Area) and, 700m west, the train station.
1 Sights
Venkateshwara Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
 
Devotees flock to Tirumala to see Venkateshwara, an avatar of Vishnu. ‘Ordinary darshan’ requires a wait of anywhere from two to eight hours in claustrophobic metal cages ringing the temple. Special-entry darshan tickets (₹300) will get you through the queue faster, though you’ll still have to brave the cages, which is part of the fun, kind of… Head to the Seeghra Darshan counters at Vaikuntam Queue Complex 1 for these tickets.
There are different hours for special-entry darshan each day: check the website. Upon entry, you’ll have to sign a form declaring your faith in Lord Venkateshwara.
Among the many powers attributed to Venkateshwara is the granting of any wish made before the idol at Tirumala. Legends about the hill itself and the surrounding area appear in the Puranas, and the temple’s history may date back 2000 years. The main temple is an atmospheric place, though you’ll be pressed between hundreds of devotees when you see it. Venkateshwara inspires bliss and love among his visitors from the back of the dark and magical inner sanctum; it smells of incense, resonates with chanting and may make you religious. You’ll have a moment to say a prayer and then you’ll be shoved out again. Don’t forget to collect your delicious ladoo from the counter: Tirumala ladoos (sweet balls made with chickpea flour, cardamom and dried fruits) are famous across India.
Many pilgrims donate their hair to the deity – in gratitude for a wish fulfilled, or to renounce ego – so hundreds of barbers attend to devotees. Tirumala and Tirupati are filled with tonsured men, women and children.4 Sleeping & Eating The TTD runs vast dormitories (beds free) and guesthouses (r ₹50-3000) near the temple in Tirumala, intended for pilgrims. To stay, check in at the Central Reception Office. Huge dining halls (meals free) on the hill feed thousands of pilgrims daily; veg restaurants also serve meals for ₹25.

8 Getting There & Away It’s possible to visit Tirumala on a (very) long day trip from Chennai. The APSRTC runs 51 daily buses direct to Tirumala (₹165 to ₹219, five hours) from Chennai's CMBT bus station.
AIR
Tirupati Airport (www.tirupatiairport.com) is at Renigunta, 14km east of town. Air
India (%2283981, airport 2283992; www.airindia.in; Srinivasam Pilgrim Amenities Complex, Tirumala By-Pass Road,Tirumala Bypass Rd; h9.30am-5.30pm), SpiceJet (%9871803333;
www.spicejet.com) and Air Costa (%9949852229; www.aircosta.in) all fly to Hyderabad
daily.
BUS
Tirupati’s bus station (%2289900) is a wonder of logistics. Useful services, all once or twice hourly, include the following: A Bengaluru (express/Volvo/night Volvo ₹230/400/450, four to six hours) A Chennai (express/Volvo ₹121/222, four hours) A Hyderabad (superluxury/Volvo ₹610/950, 10 to 12 hours) A Vijayawada (express/superluxury ₹350/460, nine hours)
TRAIN
There are numerous daily departures to main destinations; the reservation office (h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, 8am-2pm Sun) is opposite the station's east end. Typical journey times and fares for sleeper/3AC/2AC: A Bengaluru (₹250/635/885, seven hours) A Chennai (₹140/485/690, three to four hours) A Hyderabad (₹380/1030/1480, 13 hours) A Vijayawada (₹235/635/905, seven hours)8 Getting Around There's a prepaid taxi booth outside the east end of the train station.
BUS
There's a stand for buses to Tirumala opposite the train station, with departures every few minutes. The scenic one-hour trip costs ₹45/82 one-way/return; going up, sit on the left side for views.
WALKING
The TTD has constructed probably the best footpath in India for pilgrims to walk up to Tirumala. It’s about 12km from the start of the path at Alipiri on the north side of Tirupati (₹50 by autorickshaw), and takes three to six hours. You can leave your luggage at Alipiri and it will be transported free to the reception centre. There are shady rest points along the way, and a few canteens.
Around Tirumala & Tirupati
Chandragiri Fort
This fort 15km west of Tirupati dates back 1000 years, but its heyday came in the late 16th century when the rulers of the declining Vijayanagar Empire, having fled from Hampi, made it their capital. At the heart of a 1.5km-long stout-walled enclosure beneath a rocky hill, the palace area (Indian/foreigner
₹10/100; h9am-5pm Sat-Thu) contains nice gardens and the Raja Mahal, a heavily restored Vijayanagar palace reminiscent of Hampi buildings, with a reasonably interesting museum of bronze and stone sculptures. The upper fort on the hillside is frustratingly out of bounds. Buses for Chandragiri (₹10) leave Tirupati hourly. Prepaid taxis are ₹500 return.
Sri Kalahasti
Sri Kalahasti, 37km east of Tirupati, is known for its important Sri Kalahasteeswara Temple and for being, along with Machilipatnam near Vijayawada, a centre for the ancient textile-painting art of kalamkari. Cottoncloth is primed with myrabalam (resin) and cow’s milk; figures are drawn with a pointed bamboo stick dipped in fermented jaggery and water; and the dyes are made from cow dung, ground seeds, plants and flowers. You can see artists at work, and buy some of their products, in the Agraharam neighbourhood, 2.5km from the bus stand. Sri Vijayalakshmi Fine Kalamkari Arts (%9441138380; Door No 15-890; hdaily) is a 40-year-old family business employing over 60 artists. Dupatta scarves start around ₹1500.
Buses leave Tirupati for Sri Kalahasti every 10 minutes (₹35, one hour); a prepaid taxi is ₹900 return.Kerala

Why Go?
A sliver of a coastal state in India's deep south, Kerala is shaped by its layered landscape: almost 600km of glorious Arabian Sea coast and beaches; a languid network of glistening backwaters; and the spice-and tea-covered hills of the Western Ghats. Just setting foot on this swathe of soul-quenching, palm-shaded green will slow your subcontinental stride to a blissed-out amble. Kerala is a world away from the frenzy of elsewhere, as if India had passed through the Looking Glass and become an altogether more laid-back place.
Besides its famous backwaters, elegant houseboats, ayurvedic treatments and delicately spiced, taste-bud-tingling cuisine, Kerala is home to wild elephants, exotic birds and the odd tiger, while vibrant traditions such as Kathakali plays, temple festivals and snake-boat races frequently bring even the smallest villages to life. It's hard to deny Kerala's liberal use of the slogan 'God's Own Country'.
When to GoA Dec–Feb Perfect beach and backwater weather. Ernakulathappan Utsavam festival in Kochi.
A Apr Kathakali at Kottayam and Kollam festivals, and the elephant procession in Thrissur.

History Traders have been drawn to the scent of Kerala’s spices for more than 3000 years. The coast was known to the Phoenicians, the Romans, the Arabs and the Chinese, and was a transit point for spices from the Moluccas (eastern Indonesia).
The kingdom of Cheras ruled much of Kerala until the early Middle Ages, competing with kingdoms and small fiefdoms for territory and trade. Vasco da Gama’s arrival in 1498 opened the floodgates to European colonialism as Portuguese, Dutch and English interests fought Arab traders, and then each other, for control of the lucrative spice trade.
The present-day state of Kerala was created in 1956 from the former states of Travancore, Kochi and Malabar. A tradition of valuing the arts and education resulted in a post-Independence state that is one of the most progressive in India, with the nation's highest literacy rate.
In 1957 Kerala had the first freely elected communist government in the world, which has gone on to hold power regularly since – though the Congress- led United Democratic Front (UDF) has been in power since 2011. Many Malayalis (speakers of Malayalam, the state’s official language) work in the

l         i   ifi     t      t i  th                   A biMiddle East and their remittances play a significant part in the economy. A big hope for the state's future is the relatively recent boom in tourism, with Kerala emerging in the past decade as one of India’s most popular new tourist hot spots. According to Kerala Tourism almost 12 million visitors arrived in 2013 – more than double the number of a decade ago – though less than a million of these were foreign tourists.
TOP STATE FESTIVALS
As well as the major state festivals, Kerala has hundreds of annual temple festivals, theyyams (trance-induced rituals), boat race regattas and street parades. A Hundred Festivals for You, a free publication produced by Kochi's Tourist Desk, lists many of them.
Ernakulathappan Utsavam Eight days of festivities in Kochi culminating in a parade of elephants, music and fireworks.
Thrissur Pooram The elephant procession to end all elephant processions.
Nehru Trophy Boat Race The most popular of Kerala's boat races.
Onam (Statewide; hAug/Sep) Kerala's biggest cultural celebration, when the entire state celebrates the golden age of mythical King Mahabali for 10 days.

Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum)
%0471 / Pop 958,000
Kerala's capital – still usually referred to by its colonial name, Trivandrum – is a relatively compact but energetic city and an easygoing introduction to urban life down south. Most travellers merely springboard from here to the nearby beach resorts of Kovalam and Varkala, but Trivandrum has enough sights – including a zoo and cluster of Victorian museums in glorious neo-Keralan buildings – to justify a stay.Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum)

KERALA GOING DRY
In an effort to curb high per capita alcohol consumption and perceived associated social problems (including India's highest suicide rate), the Keralan government is going dry. In 2014, the government announced a 10-year plan to move towards full prohibition by gradually closing down bars (except those in four and five-star hotels) and state-run liquor outlets. Sundays have already been declared a statewide 'dry days'.
At the time of writing, almost 700 bars had been closed, mostly in two and three-star hotels, though ironically many government-run liquour outlets were still dispensing bottles of IMFL rum and brandy to long queues.
It remains to be seen how this ban might affect the tourism industry or how far the government will take it. Some locals claim that while hard liquour bars will remain closed, 'beer parlours' would open and that a Kingfisher will still be available at tourist places. Others think the black market will boom.

Villa Maya is more an experience than a restaurant. Dining is either in the magnificent 18th-century Dutch mansion or in private curtained niches in the tranquil courtyard garden, where you'll be lulled by lily ponds and trickling fountains. The Keralan cuisine itself is expertly crafted, delicately spiced and beautifully presented. Seafood is a speciality, with dishes like stuffed crab withyp

lobster butter, but there are some tantalising veg dishes too. Between lunch and dinner (3pm to 7pm) you can order snacks like sandwiches, pizzas and calzones. Ask the friendly staff for a free tour of the historic manor.
THE INDIAN COFFEE HOUSE STORY
The Indian Coffee House is a place stuck in time. Its India-wide branches feature old-India prices and waiters dressed in starched white with peacock-style headdresses. It was started by the Coffee Board in the early 1940s, during British rule. In the 1950s the Board began to close down cafes across India, making employees redundant. At this point, the Keralan-born communist leader Ayillyath Kuttiari Gopalan Nambiar began to support the workers and founded with them the India Coffee Board Worker’s Co-operative Society. The Coffee House has remained ever since, always atmospheric, and always offering bargain snacks and drinks such as Indian filter coffee, rose milk and idlis (fermented rice cakes). It’s still run by its employees, all of whom share ownership.

Buses leave for Kovalam beach (₹15, 30 minutes, every 20 minutes) between 6am and 9pm from the southern end of the East Fort bus stand on MG Rd.
TRAIN
Trains are often heavily booked, so it’s worth visiting the reservation office (
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %139; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun) at the main train station
or booking online. While most major trains arrive at Trivandrum Central Station close to the city centre, some express services terminate at Vikram Sarabhai Station (Kochuveli), about 7km north of the city – check in advance.
Within Kerala there are frequent express trains to Varkala (2nd/sleeper/3AC ₹45/140/485, one hour), Kollam (₹55/170/535, 1¼ hour) and Ernakulam
(₹95/195/535, 4½ hours), with trains passing through either Alleppey
(₹80/170/535, three hours) or Kottayam (₹80/140/485, 3½ hours). There are also numerous daily services to Kanyakumari (2nd/sleeper/3AC ₹80/140/485, three hours).8 Getting Around The airport (%2501424) is 10km from the city and 15km from Kovalam; take local bus 14 from the East Fort and City Bus stand (₹9). Prepaid taxi vouchers from the airport cost ₹350 to the city and ₹500 to Kovalam.
Autorickshaws are the easiest way to get around, with short hops costing ₹30 to ₹50.
Around Trivandrum
Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary
Surrounding an idyllic lake created by the 1964 Neyyar Dam 35km north of Trivandrum, the main attraction at this sanctuary is the Lion Safari Park
(%0471-2272182, 9744347582; Indian/foreigner ₹200/300; h9am-4pm Tue-Sun). Admission
includes a boat ride across the lake, a lion safari by bus, a visit to a deer park and the Crocodile Production Centre (named for Australian legend Steve Irwin). The fertile forest lining the shore is home to gaurs, sambar deer, sloth, elephants, lion-tailed macaques and the occasional tiger.
Get here from Trivandrum’s KSRTC bus stand by frequent bus (₹34, 1½hours). A taxi is about ₹1000 return (with two hours’ waiting time) from Trivandrum, or ₹1400 from Kovalam. The KTDC office in Trivandrum also runs tours to Neyyar Dam (₹400).
Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Dhanwantari Ashram
Just before Neyyar Dam, the superbly located Sivananda Yoga Vedanta
Dhanwantari Ashram (%0471-2273093; www.sivananda.org.in/neyyardam; dm/tent ₹750, tw
₹950-1200, with AC ₹1700), established in 1978, is renowned for its hatha yoga courses. Courses start on the 1st and 16th of each month, run for a minimum of two weeks and include various levels of accommodation and vegetarian meals. Low season (May to September) rates are ₹100 less. There’s an exacting schedule (5.30am to 10pm) of yoga practice, meditation and chanting. Bookings essential. Month-long yoga-teacher training and ayurvedic massage courses are also available.
Kovalam
%0471
Once a calm fishing village clustered around its crescent beaches, Kovalam today is Kerala’s most developed resort. The main stretch, Lighthouse Beach, is touristy with hotels and restaurants built up along the shore, while Hawa Beach to the north is usually crowded with day-trippers heading straight from the taxi stand to the sand. Neither beach is particularly clean, but at less than 15km from the capital it's a convenient place to have some fun by the sea, there's some promising surf, and it makes a good base for ayurvedic treatments and yoga courses.
About 2km further north, Samudra Beach has several upmarket resorts, restaurants and a peaceful but steep beach.Kovalam

There are strong rips at both ends of Lighthouse Beach that carry away several swimmers every year. Swim only between the flags in the area patrolled by lifeguards and avoid swimming during the monsoon.
4 Sleeping Kovalam is packed with hotels and guesthouses, though true budget places are becoming a dying breed in high season. Beachfront properties are the most expensive and sought-after, but look out for smaller places tucked away in the labyrinth of sandy paths behind the beach among the palm groves and rice paddies; they’re usually much better value. All places offer big discounts outside the December–January high season; book ahead in peak times.

5 Eating & Drinking Lighthouse Beach is the main restaurant hub and each evening dozens of places lining the beach promenade display the catch of the day – just pick a fish or lobster, settle on a price and decide how you want it prepared. Market price varies enormously depending on the day's catch, but at the time of research it was around ₹350 per fish fillet, ₹900 per half kilo of tiger prawns, and ₹3500 per kilo of lobster. Unlicensed places might serve alcohol in mugs, or with the bottles hidden discreetly out of sight (or not, depending on current government rules).
Samudra Beach, to the north, is quieter but also has some restaurants worth seeking out. For a romantic dining splurge, the restaurants at Leela and Taj by Vivanta are pricey but top class.

Poovar
About 16km southeast of Kovalam, almost at the Tamil Nadu border, Poovar is the gateway to a region of beaches, estuaries, villages and upmarket resorts that comprise the 'mini backwaters' of Kerala's far south.
Boat operators along the Neyyar River will take you on 1½-to two-hour cruises through the waterways visiting the beach, bird-filled mangrove swamps and forested Poovar Island for around ₹2500 for two people. Travel agents in Kovalam can also arrange these trips.

AYURVEDIC RESORTS

Two properties only 100m apart – one consists of beachfront cottages in Keralan style, and the other is the gorgeous hilltop location where Keralan teak cottages are filled with handcrafted furniture and set among perfectly manicured grounds with wonderful views to the ocean and swaying palm groves. Ayurvedic treatments range from one-hour massages to 28-day treatment marathons, as well as morning and afternoon yoga and meditation sessions.
Varkala
%0470 / Pop 42,270
Perched almost perilously along the edge of 15m-high red laterite cliffs, the resort of Varkala has a naturally beautiful setting and the clifftop stretch has steadily grown into Kerala's most popular backpacker hang-out. A small strand of beach nuzzles Varkala’s cliff edge, where restaurants play innocuous trance music and stalls sell T-shirts, baggy trousers and silver jewellery. It's touristy and the sales pitch can be tiring, but Varkala is still a great place to watch the days slowly turn into weeks, and it's not hard to escape the crowds further north or south where the beaches are cleaner and quieter.
Despite its backpacker vibe, Varkala is essentially a temple town, and the main Papanasham Beach is a holy place where Hindus come to make offerings for passed loved ones, assisted by priests who set up shop beneath the Hindustan Hotel.
8 Dangers & Annoyances The beaches at Varkala have strong currents; even experienced swimmers have been swept away.
During the monsoon the beach all but disappears and the cliffs themselves are slowly being eroded. Take care walking on the cliff path, especially at night – much of it is unfenced and it can be slippery in parts.
If women wear bikinis or even swimsuits on the beach at Varkala, they are likely to feel uncomfortably exposed to stares. Wearing a sarong when out of thewater will help avoid offending local sensibilities. Dress conservatively if going into Varkala town.

HINDU TEMPLE

Varkala is a temple town and Janardhana Temple is the main event – its technicolour Hindu spectacle sits hovering above Beach Rd. It’s closed to non- Hindus, but you may be invited into the temple grounds where there is a huge banyan tree and shrines to Ayyappan, Hanuman and other Hindu deities.

Sivagiri Mutt is the headquarters of the Shri Narayana Dharma Sanghom Trust, the ashram devoted to Shri Narayana Guru (1855–1928), Kerala’s most prominent guru. This is a popular pilgrimage site and the resident swami is happy to talk to visitors.
Ponnumthuruthu Island
(boat ride ₹250 per person)
ISLAND
About 10km south of Varkala, this island in the middle of a backwater lake is home to the Shiva-Parvati Hindu Temple, also known as the Golden Temple. The main reason to venture down here is the scenic punt-powered boat ride to and around the island.
Kappil Beach
BEACH
 
About 9km north of Varkala by road, Kappil Beach is a prettty and, as yet, undeveloped stretch of sand. It's also the start of a mini network of backwaters. The Kappil Lake Boat Club, near the bridge, hires out boats for short trips on the lake.
AYURVEDA
With its roots in Sanskrit, the word ayurveda comes from ayu (life) and veda
(knowledge): the knowledge or science of life. Principles of ayurvedic medicine were first documented in the Vedas some 2000 years ago, but may have been practised centuries earlier.
Ayurveda sees the world as having an intrinsic order and balance. It argues that we possess three doshas (humours): vata (wind or air), pitta (fire) and kapha (water/earth), known together as the tridoshas. Deficiency or excess in any of them can result in disease: an excess of vata may result in dizziness and debility; an increase in pitta may lead to fever, inflammation and infection. Kapha is essential for hydration.
Ayurvedic treatment aims to restore the balance, and hence good health, principally through two methods: panchakarma (internal purification) and herbal massage. Panchakarma is used to treat serious ailments, and is an intense detox regime using a combination of five types of different therapies to rid the body of built-up endotoxins. These include vaman (therapeutic vomiting), virechan (purgation), vasti (enemas), nasya(elimination of toxins through the nose) and raktamoksha (detoxification of the blood). Before panchakarma begins, the body is first prepared over several days with a special diet, oil massages (snehana) and herbal steam baths (swedana). Although it may sound pretty grim, panchakarma purification might only use a few of these treatments at a time, with therapies like bloodletting and leeches only used in rare cases. Still, this is no spa holiday. The herbs used in ayurveda grow in abundance in Kerala’s humid climate – the monsoon is thought to be the best time of year for treatment, when there is less dust in the air, the pores are open and the body is most receptive to treatment – and every village has its own ayurvedic pharmacy.
2 Activities The gently undulating path from the northern clifftop continues for a photogenic 7km to Kappil Beach, passing a subtley changing beach landscape, including Odayam Beach and the fishing village of Edava. The walk is best done early in the morning.
Yoga (₹300 to ₹400 per session) is offered at several guesthouses, and boogie boards (₹100) can be hired from places along the beach; be wary of strong currents. Many of the resorts and hotels along the north cliff offer ayurvedic treatments and massage.

%0474 / Pop 349,000
Kollam (Quilon) is the southern approach to Kerala’s backwaters and one end of the popular backwater ferry trip to Alleppey. One of the oldest ports in the Arabian Sea, it was once a major commercial hub that saw Roman, Arab, Chinese and later Portuguese, Dutch and British traders jostle into port – eager to get their hands on spices and the region’s cashew crops. The centre of town is reasonably hectic, but surrounding it are the calm waterways of Ashtamudi Lake, fringed with coconut palms, cashew plantations and traditional villages – a great place to get a feel for the backwaters without the crowds.Kollam (Quilon)

8 Getting There & Away
BOAT
Many travellers take the canal boat to or from Alleppey (₹400, eight hours, 10.30am) as part of the classic backwaters tour (see also Click here). From the main boat jetty there are frequent public ferry services across Ashtamudi Lake to Guhanandapuram (one hour). Fares are around ₹10 return, or ₹3 for a short hop.
BUS
Kollam is on the Trivandrum–Kollam–Alleppey–Ernakulam bus route, with buses departing every 10 or 20 minutes to Trivandrum (₹70, two hours), Alleppey (₹80, 2½ hours), Kumily (₹125, five hours, 7.50am) and Ernakulam(Kochi, ₹150, 3½ hours). Buses depart from the KSRTC bus stand (

TRAIN
There are frequent trains to Ernakulam (sleeper/3AC ₹140/485, 3½ hours, six daily), Trivandrum (₹140/485, one hour) via Varkala (₹36/165, 30 minutes), and Alappuzha (Alleppey; ₹170/535, 1½ hours).
MATHA AMRITHANANDAMAYI MISSION
The incongruously pink Matha Amrithanandamayi Mission (

 ;
%04762897578; www.amritapuri.org; Amrithapuri) is the famous ashram of one of India’s few female gurus, Amrithanandamayi, also known as Amma (Mother) or ‘The Hugging Mother' because of the darshan (audience) she offers, often hugging thousands of people in marathon all-night sessions.
The ashram runs official tours at 4pm and 5pm daily. It’s a huge complex, with about 3000 people living here permanently – monks, nuns, students and families, both Indian and foreign. It offers food, ayurvedic treatments, yoga and meditation. Amma travels around for much of the year, so you might be out of luck if in need of a cuddle. A busy time of year at the ashram is around Amma's birthday on 27 September.
Visitors should dress conservatively and there is a strict code of behaviour. With prior arrangement – register online – you can stay at the ashram in a triple room for ₹250 per person or in a single for ₹500 (including simple vegetarian meals).
Since the ashram is on the main canal between Kollam and Alleppey, many travellers break the ferry ride by getting off here, staying a day or two, then picking up another cruise. Alternatively, cross to the other side of the canal and grab a rickshaw 10km south to Karunagappally or 12km north to Kayankulam (around ₹200), from where you can catch onward buses or trains.
If you're not taking the cruise, catch a train to either Karunagappally or Kayankulam and take an autorickshaw (around ₹200) to Vallickavu and cross the pedestrian bridge from there. If you intend to stay a while, you can book online for an ashram taxi – they pick up from as far away as Kochi or Trivandrum.

Krishnapuram Palace Museum (%0479-2441133; admission ₹10, camera/video₹25/250; h9.30am-4.30pm Tue-Sun) is a fine example of grand Keralan architecture.
Inside are paintings, antique furniture, sculptures and a renowned 3m-high mural depicting the Gajendra Moksha (liberation of Gajendra, chief of the elephants) as told in the Mahabharata.
Buses (₹26, one hour) leave Kollam every few minutes for Kayamkulam. Get off at the bus stand near the temple gate, 2km before the palace.
Alappuzha (Alleppey)
%0477 / Pop 74,200
Alappuzha – still more romantically known as Alleppey – is the hub of Kerala's backwaters, home to a vast network of waterways and more than a thousand houseboats. Wandering around the small but chaotic city centre, with its modest grid of canals, you'd be hard-pressed to agree with the 'Venice of the East' tag. But step out of this mini-mayhem – west to the beach or in practically any other direction towards the backwaters – and Alleppey is graceful and greenery- fringed, disappearing into a watery world of villages, punted canoes, toddy shops and, of course, houseboats. Float along and gaze over paddy fields of succulent green, curvaceous rice barges and village life along the banks. This is one of Kerala’s most mesmerisingly beautiful and relaxing experiences.Alappuzha (Alleppey)

8 Getting There & Away
BOAT
Ferries run to Kottayam (₹10) from the boat jetty on VCSB (Boat Jetty) Rd.
BUS
From the KSRTC bus stand, frequent buses head to Trivandrum (₹122, 3½ hours, every 20 minutes), Kollam (₹70, 2½ hours) and Ernakulam (Kochi, ₹52, 1½ hours). Buses to Kottayam (₹43, 1¼ hours, every 30 minutes) are much faster than the ferry. One bus daily leaves for Kumily at 6.40am (₹120, 5½ hours). The Varkala bus (₹89, 3½ hours) leaves at 9am and 10.40am daily.TRAIN
There are numerous daily trains to Ernakulam (2nd-class/sleeper/3AC
₹50/170/535, 1½ hours) and Trivandrum (₹80/140/485, three hours) via Kollam (₹66/140/485, 1½ hours). Six trains a day stop at Varkala (2nd-class/AC chair ₹65/255, two hours). The train station is 4km west of town.
8 Getting Around An autorickshaw from the train station to the boat jetty and KSRTC bus stand is around ₹60. Several guesthouses around town hire out scooters for ₹300 per day.
KERALA'S BACKWATERS
The undisputed highlight of a trip to Kerala is travelling through the 900km network of waterways that fringe the coast and trickle inland. Long before the advent of roads, these waters were the slippery highways of Kerala, and many villagers still use paddle-power as their main form of transport. Trips through the backwaters traverse palm-fringed lakes studded with cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, and wind their way along narrow, shady canals where coir (coconut fibre), copra (dried coconut kernels) and cashews are loaded onto boats. Along the way are isolated villages where farming life continues as it has for eons.
TOURIST CRUISES
The popular tourist cruise between Kollam and Alleppey (₹400) departs from either end at 10.30am, arriving at 6.30pm, daily from July to March and every second day at other times. Generally, there’s a 1pm lunch stop and a brief afternoon chai stop. Bring drinks, snacks, sunscreen and a hat.
It’s a scenic and leisurely way – the journey takes eight hours – to get between the two towns, but the boat travels along only the major canals – you won’t have many close-up views of the village life that makes the backwaters so magical. Another option is to take the trip halfway (₹200) and get off at the Matha Amrithanandamayi Mission.
HOUSEBOATS
If the stars align, renting a houseboat designed like a kettuvallam (rice barge) could well be one of the highlights of your trip to India. It can be an expensive experience (depending on your budget) but for a couple on a romantic overnight jaunt or split between a group of travellers, it's usually worth every rupee. Drifting through quiet canals lined with coconut palms, eating delicious Keralan food, meeting local villagers and sleeping on the water – it’s a world away from the usual clamour of India.
Houseboats cater for couples (one or two double bedrooms) and groups (up to seven bedrooms). Food (and an onboard chef to cook it) is generally included in the quoted)(
)g            y
q
cost, as is a driver/captain. Houseboats can be chartered through a multitude of private operators in Alleppey, Kollam and Kottayam. This is the biggest business in Kerala and the quality of boats varies widely, from rust buckets to floating palaces of varying cleanliness – try to inspect the boat before agreeing on a price. Travel-agency reps will be pushing you to book a boat as soon as you set foot in Kerala, but it’s better to wait till you reach a backwater hub: choice is greater in Alleppey (an extraordinary 1000-plus boats), and you’re much more likely to be able to bargain down a price if you turn up and see what’s on offer. Most guesthouses and homestays can also book you on a houseboat.
In the busy high season, when prices peak, you’re likely to get caught in backwater- gridlock – some travellers are disappointed by the number of boats on the water. It’s possible to travel by houseboat between Alleppey and Kollam and part way to Kochi – though these trips spend more time on open lakes and large canals than true backwaters and take longer than most travellers expect. Expect a boat for two people for 24 hours to cost about ₹6000 to ₹8000 at the budget level; for four people, ₹10,000 to ₹12,000; for larger boats or for air-conditioning expect to pay from ₹15,000 to ₹30,000. Shop around to negotiate a bargain – though this will be harder in the peak season. Prices triple from around 20 December to 5 January.
VILLAGE TOURS & CANOE BOATS
More and more travellers are opting for village tours or canal-boat trips. Village tours usually involve small groups of five to six people, a knowledgeable guide and an open canoe or covered kettuvallam. The tours (from Kochi, Kollam or Alleppey) last from 2½ to six hours and cost from around ₹400 to ₹800 per person. They include visits to villages to watch coir-making, boat building, toddy (palm beer) tapping and fish farming. The Munroe Island trip from Kollam is an excellent tour of this type; the tourist desk in Ernakulam also organises recommended tours.
PUBLIC FERRIES
If you want the local backwater transport experience for just a few rupees, there are State Water Transport (www.swtd.gov.in) boats between Alleppey and Kottayam (₹19, 2½ hours) five times daily starting from Alleppey at 7.30am. The trip crosses Vembanad Lake and has a more varied landscape than the Kollam–Alleppey cruise.
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
Pollution from houseboat motors is becoming a major problem as boat numbers increase. The Keralan authorities have introduced an ecofriendly accreditation system for houseboat operators. Among the criteria an operator must meet before being issued with the ‘Green Palm Certificate’ are the installation of solar panels and sanitary tanks for the disposal of waste – ask operators whether they have the requisite certification. Consider choosing one of the few remaining punting, rather than motorised, boats if possible, though these can only operate in shallow water.Around Alleppey
Kattoor & Marari Beaches
The beaches at Kattoor and Marari, 10km and 14km north of Alleppey respectively, are a popular beachside alternative to the backwaters.
Marari is the flashier of the two, with some exclusive five-star beachfront accommodation, while Kattoor, sometimes known as 'Secret Beach', is more of a fishing village, where development is at a minimum and sandy back lanes lead down to near-deserted sands.

Kottayam
%0481 / Pop 335,000
Conveniently placed between the Western Ghats and the backwaters, Kottayam is renowned for being the centre of Kerala’s spice and rubber trade, rather than for its aesthetic appeal. For most travellers it’s a hub town, well connected to both the mountains and the backwaters, with many travellers taking the public canal cruise to or from Alleppey before heading east to Kumily or north to Kochi. The city itself has a crazy, traffic-clogged centre, but you don't have to go far to be in the villages and waterways.
The Thirunakkara Utsavam festival is held in March at the Thirunakkara Shiva Temple.

Around KottayamKumarakom
%0481
Kumarakom, 16km west of Kottayam and on the shore of vast Vembanad Lake – Kerala's largest lake – is an unhurried backwater village with a smattering of dazzling top-end sleeping options and a renowned bird sanctuary. You can arrange houseboats through Kumarakom’s less-crowded canals, but expect to pay considerably more than in Alleppey.
Arundhati Roy, author of the 1997 Booker Prize–winning The God of Small Things, was raised in the nearby Aymanam village.

Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary

South India’s most popular wildlife sanctuary, Periyar (%04869-224571;
www.periyartigerreserve.org; Indian/foreigner ₹25/450; h6am-6pm (last entry 5pm)) encompasses
777 sq km and a 26-sq-km artificial lake created by the British in 1895. The vast region is home to bison, sambar, wild boar, langur, 900 to 1000 elephants and 35 to 40 hard-to-spot tigers. Firmly established on both the Indian and foreigner tourist trails, the place can sometimes feel a bit like Disneyland-in-the-Ghats, but its mountain scenery and jungle walks make for an enjoyable visit. Bring warm and waterproof clothing.
Kumily is the closest town and home to a growing strip of hotels, homestays, spice shops, chocolate shops and Kashmiri emporiums. Thekkady, 4km from Kumily, is the sanctuary centre with the KTDC hotels and boat jetty. Confusingly, when people refer to the sanctuary they tend to use Thekkady, Kumily and Periyar interchangeably.Kumily & Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary

1 Sights & Activities Various tours and trips access Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, all arranged through the Ecotourism Centre. Most hotels and agencies around town can arrange all-day jeep jungle safaris (per person ₹1600- 2000; h5am-6.30pm), which cover more than 40km of trailsin jungle bordering the park, though many travellers complain that at least 30km of the trip is on sealed roads.
Cooking classes (around ₹300-450) are offered by many local homestays.
There are recommended four-hour classes at Bar-B-Que (

Periyar Lake Cruise
(adult/child ₹150/50; hdepartures 7.30am, 9.30am, 11.15am, 1.45pm & 3.30pm)
BOATING
These 1½-hour boat trips around the lake are the main way to tour the sanctuary without taking a guided walk. You might see deer, boar and birdlife but it's generally more of a cruise – often a rowdy one – than a wildlife-spotting experience. Boats are operated by the forest department and by the KTDC – the ticket counters are together in the main building above the boat jetty, and you must buy a ticket before boarding the boat. In high season get to the ticket office 1½ hours before each trip to buy tickets. The first and last departures offer thepy
p
best prospects for wildlife spotting, and October to March are generally the best time to see animals.

Buses leave every 30 minutes for Kottayam (₹84, four hours), with two direct buses to Trivandrum at 8.45am and 11am (₹210, eight hours) and one daily bus to Alleppey at 1.10pm (₹120, 5½ hours). Private buses to Munnar (₹80, four to five hours) also leave from the bus stand at 6am, 9.45am and noon.
Tamil Nadu buses leave every 30 minutes to Madurai (₹90, four hours) from the Tamil Nadu bus stand just over the border.
8 Getting Around It's only about 1.5km from Kumily bus stand to the main park entrance, but it's another 3km from there to Periyar Lake; you might catch a bus (almost as rare as the tigers), but will more likely take an autorickshaw from the entry post (₹70) or set off on foot – but bear in mind there's no walking path so you'll have to dodge traffic on the road. Autorickshaws will take you on short hops around town for ₹30.
Kumily town is small enough to explore on foot but some guesthouses hire bicycles (₹200) and most can arrange scooter hire (₹500) if you want to explore further afield.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
SABARIMALA
Deep in the Western Ghats, about 20km west of Gavi and some 50km from the town of Erumeli, is a place called Sabarimala, home to the Ayyappan temple. It's said to be one of the world's most visited pilgrimage centres, with anywhere between 40 and 60 million Hindu devotees trekking here each year. Followers believe the god Ayyappan meditated at this spot. Non-Hindus can join the pilgrimage but strict rules apply, and women aged 12 to 50 are only allowed as far as the Pampa checkpoint. For information see
www.sabarimala.kerala.gov.in or www.sabarimala.org.

carpeted in emerald-green tea plantations, contoured, clipped and sculpted like ornamental hedges. The low mountain scenery is magnificent – you’re often up above the clouds watching veils of mist clinging to the mountaintops. Munnar town itself is a scruffy administration centre, not unlike a North Indian hill station, but wander just a few kilometres out of town and you’ll be engulfed in a sea of a thousand shades of green.
Once known as the High Range of Travancore, today Munnar is the commercial centre of some of the world’s highest tea-growing estates. The majority of the plantations are operated by corporate giant Tata, with some in the hands of local co-operative Kannan Devan Hills Plantation Company (KDHP).

1 Sights & Activities The main reason to visit Munnar is to explore the lush, tea-filled hillocks that surround it.
Hotels, homestays, travel agencies, autorickshaw drivers and practically every passerby will want to organise a day of sightseeing for you: shop around, though rates are fairly standard. The best way to experience the hills is on a guided trek, which can range from a half-day 'soft trekking' around tea plantations (from ₹600 per person) to more arduous full-day mountain treks (from ₹800), which open up some stupendous views. Trekking guides can easily be organised through hotels and guesthouses or the DTPC.
Bear in mind that the tea plantations are private property and trekking around without a licensed guide is trespassing.Tea Museum

About 1.5km northwest of town, this museum is as close as you’ll get to a working tea factory around Munnar. It’s a demo model of the real thing, but it still shows the basic process. A collection of old bits and pieces from the colonial era, including photographs and a 1905 tea-roller, are also kept here. A 30-minute video explaining the history of Munnar, its tea estates and the programs put in place for its workers screens hourly. The walk to or from town follows the busy road with views of tea plantations; an autorickshaw charges ₹25 from the bazaar.

T Tours The DTPC runs three fairly rushed but inexpensive full-day tours to points around Munnar. The Sandal Valley Tour (per person ₹400; htour 9am-6pm) visits Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, several viewpoints, waterfalls, plantations, a sandalwood forest and villages. The Tea Valley tour (per person ₹400; htour 10am-6pm) visits Echo Point, Top Station and Rajamalai (for Eravikulam National Park), among other places. The Village Sightseeing Tour ( ₹400; h9.30am-6pm) covers Devikulam, Anayirankal Dam, Ponmudy and a farm tour among others. You can hire a taxi to visit the main local sights for around ₹1300.4 Sleeping Munnar has plenty of accommodation but it seems a shame to stay in Munnar town when the views and peace are out in the hills and valleys. There are some good budget options just south of the town centre; if you really want to feel the serenity and are willing to pay a bit more, head for the hills.

Possibly the most protected environment in South India – nestled behind three dams in a valley surrounded by Keralan and Tamil Nadu sanctuaries – Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary constitutes 285 sq km of Kipling-storybook scenery and wildlife-spotting goodness. Far less touristed than Periyar, it’s home to elephants, bison, gaur, sloths, sambar, crocodiles, tigers, panthers and some of the largest teak trees in Asia. The sanctuary is best avoided during monsoon (June to August) and it sometimes closes in March and April.Contact the Information Centre in Anappady to arrange tours of the park, hikes (one- /two-day treks from ₹3000/6000, shorter treks from ₹600) and accommodation in tree-top huts (₹3000 to ₹5000) or niche tents (₹6000).

CENTRAL KERALA
Kochi (Cochin)
%0484 / Pop 601,600
Serene Kochi has been drawing traders and explorers to its shores for over 600 years. Nowhere else in India could you find such an intriguing mix: giant fishing nets from China, a 400-year-old synagogue, ancient mosques, Portuguese houses and the crumbling remains of the British Raj. The result is an unlikely blend of medieval Portugal, Holland and an English village grafted onto the tropical Malabar Coast. It’s a delightful place to spend some time and nap in some of India’s finest homestays and heritage accommodation. Kochi is also a centre for Keralan arts and one of the best places to see Kathakali and kalarippayat.
Mainland Ernakulam is the hectic transport and cosmopolitan hub of Kochi, while the historical towns of Fort Cochin and Mattancherry, though well- touristed, remain wonderfully atmospheric – thick with the smell of the past. Other islands, including Willingdon and Vypeen, are linked by a network of ferries and bridges.1 Sights
Fort Cochin
Fort Cochin has a couple of small, sandy beaches which are only really good for people-watching in the evening and gazing out at the incoming tankers. A popular promenade winds around from Mahatma Gandhi Beach to the Chinese fishing nets and fish market. This part of Fort Cochin's foreshore is sadly rubbish-strewn and grubby but local organisations are working towards cleaning it up.
Look out along the shore for the scant remains of Fort Immanuel, the 16th- century Portuguese fort from which the area takes its name.Fort Cochin

LANDMARK(

The unofficial emblems of Kerala’s backwaters, and perhaps the most photographed, are the half-dozen or so giant cantilevered Chinese fishing nets on Fort Cochin's northeastern shore. A legacy of traders from the AD 1400 court of Kublai Khan, these enormous, spiderlike contraptions require at least four people to operate their counterweights at high tide. Modern fishing techniques are making these labour-intensive methods less and less profitable, but they still supply the fresh seafood you'll see on display for sale. Smaller fishing nets are dotted around the shores of Vembanad Lake.

Mattancherry & Jew Town
About 3km southeast of Fort Cochin, Mattancherry is the old bazaar district and centre of the spice trade. These days it's packed with spice shops and pricey Kashmiri-run emporiums that autorickshaw drivers will fall over backwards to take you to for a healthy commission – any offer of a cheap tour of the district will inevitably lead to a few shops. In the midst of this, Jew Town is a bustling port area with a fine synagogue. Scores of small firms huddle together in dilapidated old buildings and the air is filled with the biting aromas of ginger, cardamom, cumin, turmeric and cloves, though the lanes around the Dutch Palace and synagogue are packed with antique and tourist-curio shops rather than spices.Mattancherry

Street parades, colourful costumes, embellished elephants, music, folk dancing and lots of fun.4 Sleeping Fort Cochin can feel a bit touristy and crowded in season but, with some of Kerala's finest accommodation, it's a great place to escape the noise and chaos of the mainland. This is India’s homestay capital, with dozens of family houses offering clean budget rooms, home-cooked meals and a hearty welcome.
Ernakulam is cheaper and more convenient for onward travel, but the ambience and accommodation choices are less inspiring. Regardless of where you stay, book ahead during December and January. At other times you may be able to bargain for a discount.

3 Entertainment There are several places in Kochi where you can view Kathakali. The performances are designed for tourists, but they’re a good introduction to this intriguing art form. The standard program starts with the intricate make-up application and costume-fitting, followed by a demonstration and commentary on the dance and then the performance – usually two hours in all. The fast-paced traditional martial art of kalarippayat can also be easily seen, often at the same theatres.
TRADITIONAL KERALAN ARTS
KATHAKALI
The art form of Kathakali crystallised at around the same time as Shakespeare was scribbling his plays. The Kathakali performance is the dramatised presentation of a play, usually based on the Hindu epics the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. All the great themes are covered – righteousness and evil, frailty and courage, poverty and prosperity, war and peace.
Drummers and singers accompany the actors, who tell the story through their precise movements, particularly mudras (hand gestures) and facial expressions.
Preparation for the performance is lengthy and disciplined. Paint, fantastic costumes,ornamental headpieces and meditation transform the actors both physically and mentally into the gods, heroes and demons they are about to play. Dancers even stain their eyes red with seeds from the chundanga plant to maximise the drama.
Traditional performances can last for many hours, but you can see cut-down performances in tourist hot spots all over the state, and there are Kathakali schools in Trivandrum and near Thrissur that encourage visitors.
KALARIPPAYAT
Kalarippayat (or kalari) is an ancient tradition of martial arts training and discipline, still taught throughout Kerala. Some believe it is the forerunner of all martial arts, with roots tracing back to the 12th-century skirmishes among Kerala’s feudal principalities.
Masters of kalarippayat, called Gurukkal, teach their craft inside a special arena called a kalari. You can see often kalarippayat performances at the same venues as Kathakali.
The three main schools of kalarippayat can be divided into northern and central, both practised in northern Kerala and Malabar region, and southern kalarippayat. As well as open hand combat and grappling, demonstrations of the martial art are often associated with the use of weapons, including sword and shield (valum parichayum), short stick (kurunthadi) and long stick (neduvadi).

AIRAIR
Kochi International Airport is a popular hub, with international flights to/from the Gulf States, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Malaysia and Singapore.
On domestic routes, Jet Airways, Air India, Indigo and Spicejet fly direct daily to Chennai, Mumbai, Bengalaru, Hyderabad, Delhi and Trivandrum (but not Goa). Air India flies to Delhi daily and to Agatti in the Lakshadweep islands six times a week.
BUS
All long-distance services operate from Ernakulam. The KSRTC bus stand (
GOOGLE MAP
 ; %2372033; hreservations 6am-10pm) still has a few services but most
state-run and private buses pull into the massive new Vyttila Mobility Hub (%2306611; www.vyttilamobilityhub.com; h24hr), a state-of-the-art transport terminal about 2km east of Ernakulam Junction train station. Numerous private bus companies have super-deluxe, air-con, video and Volvo buses to long-distance destinations such as Bengaluru, Chennai, Mangalore, Trivandrum and Coimbatore; prices vary depending on the standard but the best buses are about 50% higher than government buses. Agents in Ernakulam and Fort Cochin sell tickets. Private buses also use the Kaloor bus stand, 1km north of the city.
A prepaid autorickshaw from Vyttila costs ₹73 to the boat jetty, ₹190 to Fort Cochin and ₹370 to the airport.TRAIN
Ernakulam has two train stations, Ernakulam Town and Ernakulam Junction. Reservations for both are made at the Ernakulam Junction reservations office
(%132; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, 8am-2pm Sun).
There are local and express trains to Trivandrum (2nd-class/sleeper/3AC ₹95/195/535, 4½ hours), via either Alleppey (₹50/170/535, 1½ hours) or Kottayam (₹55/140/485, 1½ hours). Trains also run to Thrissur (2nd/AC chair ₹60/255, 1½ hours), Calicut (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹140/485/690, 4½ hours) and Kannur (₹220/535/735, 6½ hours).8 Getting Around An above-ground metro (www.kochmetro.org) is under construction in Ernakalum, which will connect the airport with the city when completed. The first phase is due in 2016.
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
Kochi International Airport (%2610125; http://cochinairport.com) is at Nedumbassery, 30km northeast of Ernakulam. Air-con buses run between the airport and Fort Cochin (₹80, one hour, eight daily), some going via Ernakulam. Taxis to/from Ernakulam cost around ₹850, and to/from Fort Cochin around
₹1200, depending on the time of night.
BOAT
Ferries are the fastest and most enjoyable form of transport between Fort Cochin and the mainland. The jetty on the eastern side of Willingdon Island is called Embarkation; the west one, opposite Mattancherry, is Terminus; and the main stop at Fort Cochin is Customs, with another stop at the Mattancherry Jetty near the synagogue. One-way fares are ₹4 (₹6 between Ernakulam and Mattancherry).
Ernakulam
There are services to both Fort Cochin jetties (Customs and Mattancherry) every 25 to 50 minutes from Ernakulam’s main jetty between 4.40am and 9.10pm.
Ferries also run every 20 minutes or so to Willingdon and Vypeen IslandsFerries also run every 20 minutes or so to Willingdon and Vypeen Islands.
Fort Cochin
Ferries run from Customs Jetty to Ernakulam regularly between 5am and
9.50pm. Ferries also hop between Customs Jetty and Willingdon Island 18 times a day.
Car and passenger ferries cross to Vypeen Island from Fort Cochin virtually nonstop.
LOCAL TRANSPORT
There are no regular bus services between Fort Cochin and Mattancherry Palace, but it’s an enjoyable 30-minute walk through the busy warehouse area along Bazaar Rd. Autorickshaws should cost around ₹70, much less if you promise to look in a shop. Most short autorickshaw trips around Ernakulam shouldn’t cost more than ₹50.
To get to Fort Cochin after ferries (and buses) stop running you'll need to catch a taxi or autorickshaw – Ernakulam Town train station to Fort Cochin should cost around ₹400; prepaid autorickshaws during the day cost ₹250.
Scooters (₹300 per day) and Enfields (₹400 to ₹600 per day) can be hired from a number of agents in Fort Cochin.
Around Kochi
Cherai Beach
On Vypeen Island and 25km from Fort Cochin, Cherai Beach makes a nice day trip or getaway from Kochi, especially if you hire a scooter or motorbike in Fort Cochin. The main beach entrance can get busy at times but with miles of lazy backwaters just a few hundred metres from the seafront, it's a pleasant place to explore.
To get here from Fort Cochin, catch the vehicle-ferry to Vypeen Island (₹3 per person) and either hire an autorickshaw from the jetty (around ₹400) or catch one of the frequent buses (₹15, one hour) and get off at Cherai village, 1km from the beach. Buses also go here direct from Ernakulam via theVallarpadam bridge.

Parur & Chennamangalam
Nowhere is the tightly woven religious cloth that is India more apparent than in Parur, 35km north of Kochi. Here, one of the oldest synagogues (admission ₹5; h9am-5pm Tue-Sun) in Kerala, at Chennamangalam, 8km from Parur, has been fastidiously renovated. Inside you can see door and ceiling wood reliefs in dazzling colours, while just outside lies one of the oldest tombstones in India, inscribed with the Hebrew date corresponding to 1269. The Jesuits first arrived in Chennamangalam in 1577 and there’s a Jesuit church and the ruins of a Jesuit college adjacent. Nearby is a Hindu temple on a hill overlooking the Periyar River, a 16th-century mosque, and Muslim and Jewish burial grounds.
In Parur town, you’ll find the agraharam (place of Brahmins) – a small street of closely packed and brightly coloured houses originally settled by Tamil Brahmins.
Parur is compact, but Chennamangalam is best visited with a guide. Travel agencies in Fort Cochin can organise tours.

Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary
%04936
Many Keralans rate the Wayanad region as the most beautiful part of their state. Encompassing part of a remote forest reserve that spills into Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, Wayanad’s landscape combines epic mountain scenery, rice paddies of ludicrous green, skinny betel nut trees, bamboo, red earth, spiky ginger fields, and rubber, cardamom and coffee plantations. Foreign travellers are making it here in increasing numbers, partly because it provides easy access between Mysore or Bangaluru and Kerala, but it’s still fantastically unspoilt and satisfyingly remote. It's also an excellent place to spot wild elephants.
The 345-sq-km sanctuary has two separate pockets – Muthanga in the east bordering Tamil Nadu, and Tholpetty in the north bordering Karnataka. Three main towns in Wayanad district make good bases and transport hubs for exploring the sanctuary – Kalpetta in the south, Sultanbatheri (Sultan Battery) in the east and Mananthavadi in the northwest – though the best of the accommodation is scattered throughout the region.
Most hotels and homestays can arrange guided jeep tours to various parts of Wayanad.1 Sights & Activities

The two-hour jeep tours at Tholpetty (%04935250853; jeep ₹500; h7-10am & 3-5pm)

Permits and guides are mandatory and can be arranged at forest offices in South or North Wayanad or through your accommodation. The standard cost for permit and guide is ₹2500 for up to five people – try to arrange a group in advance. The DTPC office in Kalpetta also organises trekking guides and transport.

8 Getting There & Away Although remote, Wayanad is easily accessible by bus from Calicut and Kannur in Kerala, and from Mysore (Karnataka) and Ooty (Tamil Nadu). Buses brave the winding roads – including a series of nine spectacular hairpin bends – between Calicut and Kalpetta (₹60 to ₹76, two hours) every 15 minutes, with some continuing on to Sultanbatheri (₹80, three hours) and others to Mananthavadi (₹87, three hours). Hourly buses run between Kannur and Mananthavadi (₹70, 2½ hours).
From Sultanbatheri, an 8am bus heads out for Ooty (₹100, four hours), with a second one passing through town at around 12.45pm. Buses run from Kalpetta to Mysore (₹130 to ₹160, four hours, hourly), via Sultanbatheri, but note that the border gate is closed between 7pm and 6am. There are four daily buses to Mysore (₹144, three hours) on the alternative northern route from Mananthavadi, where the border is open 24 hours.
8 Getting Around The Wayanad district is quite spread out but plenty of private buses connect the main towns of Mananthavadi, Kalpetta and Sultanbatheri every 10 to 20 minutes during daylight hours (₹15 to ₹25, 45 minutes to one hour). From Mananthavadi, regular buses also head to Tholpetty (₹15, one hour). You can hire jeeps or taxis to get between towns for ₹600 to ₹800 each way, or hire a vehicle to tour the region for around ₹2000 per day.
There are plenty of autorickshaws and taxis for short hops within the towns.Kannur & Around
%0497 / Pop 1.2 million
Kerala's northern coast is far less touristed than the south, which for many is an attraction in its own right. The main draw in this part of coastal Kerala are the beautiful, undeveloped beaches and the enthralling theyyam possession rituals.
Under the Kolathiri rajas, Kannur (Cannanore) was a major port bristling with international trade – explorer Marco Polo christened it a ‘great emporium of spice trade’. Since then, the usual colonial suspects, including the Portuguese, Dutch and British, have had a go at exerting their influence on the region. Today it is an unexciting, though agreeable, town known mostly for its weaving industry and cashew trade.
This is a predominantly Muslim area, so local sensibilities should be kept in mind: wear a sarong over your bikini on the beach.
1 Sights & Activities Kannur's main town beach is the 4km-long Payyambalam Beach (beach park ₹5, camera ₹25), which starts about 1.5km east of the train station, just past the military cantonment. The beach park gets busy in the evening when families and couples come down to watch the sunset and picnic.

HANDICRAFTS WORKSHOP
The Kannur region is known for the manufacture of beedis, those tiny Indiancigarettes deftly rolled inside green leaves. This is one of the largest and purportedly best manufacturers, with a factory at Thottada, 7km south of Kannur and about 4km from Thottada Beach. A skilled individual can roll up to 1000 a day. Visitors are welcome to look around; an autorickshaw should cost around ₹120 return from Kannur town.
THEYYAM
Kerala’s most popular ritualistic art form, theyyam is believed to pre-date Hinduism, originating from folk dances performed during harvest celebrations. An intensely local ritual, it’s often performed in kavus (sacred groves) throughout northern Kerala.
Theyyam refers both to the shape of the deity/hero portrayed, and to the actual ritual. There are around 450 different theyyams, each with a distinct costume, made up of face paint, bracelets, breastplates, skirts, garlands and exuberant, intricately crafted headdresses that can be up to 6m or 7m tall. During performances, each protagonist loses his physical identity and speaks, moves and blesses the devotees as if he were that deity. Frenzied dancing and wild drumming create an atmosphere in which a deity indeed might, if it so desired, manifest itself in human form.
During October to May there are annual rituals at each of the hundreds of kavus. Theyyams are often held to bring good fortune to important events such as marriages and housewarmings.The best place for visitors to see theyyam is in village temples in the Kannur region of northern Kerala (most frequently between late November and mid- April). In peak times (December to February) there should be a theyyam ritual happening somewhere almost every night.
Although tourists are welcome to attend, this is not a dance performance but a religious ritual, and the usual rules of temple behaviour apply: dress appropriately, avoid disturbing participants and villagers; refrain from displays of public affection. Photography is permitted, but avoid using a flash. For details on where and when, ask at your guesthouse or contact Kurien at Costa Malabari.

8 Getting There & Away
BUS
Kannur has several bus stands: the enormous central bus stand – one of thelargest in Kerala – is the place to catch private and some government buses, but most buses still use the KSRTC bus stand near the Caltex junction, 1km northeast of the train station.
There are daily buses to Mysore (₹200, eight hours, six daily), Madikeri (₹80, 2½ hours, 11am) and Ooty (via Wayanad, ₹225, nine hours, 7.30am and 10pm).
For the Wayanad region, buses leave every hour from the central bus stand to Mananthavadi (₹80, 2½ hours).
For Thottada Beach, take bus 29 (₹8) from Plaza Junction opposite the train station and get off at Adikatalayi village.
TRAIN
There are frequent daily trains to Calicut (2nd-class/AC chair ₹60/255, 1½ hours), Ernakulam (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹₹220/535/735, 6½ hours) and Alleppey (₹245/625/870). Heading north there are express trains to Mangalore (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹140/485/690, three hours) and up to Goa (sleeper/3AC/2AC ₹350/910/1285, eight hours).
Bekal & Around
%0467
Bekal and nearby Palakunnu and Udma, in Kerala’s far north, have some long white-sand beaches begging for DIY exploration. The area is gradually being colonised by glitzy five-star resorts catering to fresh-from-the-Gulf millionaires, but it’s still worth the trip for off-the-beaten-track adventurers.
The laterite-brick Bekal Fort (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h8am-5pm), built between
1645 and 1660, sits on Bekal’s rocky headland and houses a small Hindu temple and plenty of goats. Next door, Bekal Beach (admission ₹5) encompasses a grassy park and a long, beautiful stretch of sand that turns into a circus on weekends and holidays when local families descend here for rambunctious leisure time. Isolated Kappil Beach, 6km north of Bekal, is a beautiful, lonely stretch of fine sand and calm water, but beware of shifting sandbars.
4 Sleeping Apart from the five-star Vivanta Taj and Lalithotels in Bekal, there are lots of cheap, poor-quality hotels scattered between Kanhangad (12km south) and Kasaragod (10km north), with a few notable exceptions.

Frequent buses run from Bekal to both Kanhangad and Kasaragod (around ₹12, 20 minutes), from where you can pick up major trains to Mangalore, Goa or south to Kochi. An autorickshaw from Bekal Junction to Kappil Beach is around ₹60.

Kerala's 'northern backwaters' offer an intriguing alternative to better-known waterwaysdown south. This large body of water is fed by five rivers and fringed by ludicrously green groves of nodding palms. One of the nearest towns is Payyanur, 50km north of Kannur. It’s possible to catch the ferry from Kotti, from where KSWTD operates local ferries to the surrounding islands. It’s five minutes’ walk from Payyanur railway station. The 2½-hour trip (₹10) from Kotti takes you to the Ayitti Jetty, 8km from Payyanur, from where you can also catch the return ferry.
You can stay at the peaceful Valiyaparamba Retreat (%04842371761;

LAKSHADWEEP
Pop 64,500
Comprising a string of 36 palm-covered, white-sand-skirted coral islands 300km off the coast of Kerala, Lakshadweep is as stunning as it is isolated. Only 10 of these islands are inhabited, mostly by Sunni Muslim fishermen, and foreigners are only allowed to stay on a few of these. With fishing and coir production the main sources of income, local life on the islands remains highly traditional, and a caste system divides the islanders between Koya (land owners), Malmi (sailors) and Melachery (farmers).
The real attraction of the islands lies under the water: the 4200 sq km of pristine archipelago lagoons, unspoiled coral reefs and warm waters are a magnet for flipper-toting travellers and divers alike.
Lakshadweep can only be visited on a prearranged package trip. At the time of research, resorts on Kadmat, Minicoy, Kavaratti, Agatti and Bangaram islands were open to tourists – though most visits to the islands are boat-based packages which include a cruise from Kochi, island visits, watersports, diving and nights spent on board the boat.

Tamil Nadu & ChennaiWhy Go?
Tamil Nadu is the homeland of one of humanity’s living classical civilisations, stretching back uninterrupted for two millennia and very much alive today in the Tamils' language, dance, poetry and Hindu religion.
But this state, with its age-old trading vocation, is as dynamic as it is immersed in tradition. Fire-worshipping devotees who smear tikka on their brows in the famously spectacular Tamil temples might rush off to IT offices to develop new software applications – and then unwind at a swanky night-time haunt in rapidly modernising Chennai (Madras).
When the heat and noise of Tamil Nadu's temple towns overwhelm, escape to the very end of India where three seas mingle, or up to the cool, forest-clad, wildlife-prowled Western Ghats. It’s all packed into a state that remains proudly distinct from the rest of India, while at the same time being among the most welcoming.

DRAVIDIAN PRIDE
Since before Indian Independence in 1947, Tamil politicians have railed against caste (which they see as favouring light-skinned Brahmins) and the Hindi language (seen as North Indian cultural imperialism). The pre-Independence ‘Self Respect’ movement and Justice Party, influenced by Marxism, mixed South Indian communal values with class- war rhetoric, and spawned Tamil political parties that remain the major powers in Tamil Nadu today. In the early post-Independence decades there was even a movement for an independent Dravida Nadu nation comprising the four main South Indian peoples, but there was little solidarity between different groups. Today Dravidian politics is largely restricted to Tamil Nadu, where parties are often led by former film stars.
During the conflict in nearby Sri Lanka, many Indian Tamil politicians loudly defended the Tamil Tigers, the organisation that assassinated Rajiv Gandhi in a village near Chennai (Madras) in 1991. There is still considerable prejudice among the generally tolerant Tamils towards anything Sinhalese. The most obvious sign of Tamil pride that you'll see today is the white shirt and white mundu (sarong), worn by any Tamil public figure worth their salt.
History
The Tamils consider themselves the standard bearers of Dravidian – pre-Aryan Indian – civilisation. Dravidians are defined as speakers of languages of the Dravidian family, the four most important of which are all rooted in South India
Tamil Malayalam (Kerala) Telugu (Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) and– Tamil, Malayalam (Kerala), Telugu (Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) and Kannada (Karnataka). South Indian cultures and history are distinct from Aryan North India, and Tamils' ability to trace their identity back in an unbroken line to classical antiquity is a source of considerable pride.
Despite the Dravidians' long-standing southern location, elements of Dravidian culture – including a meditating god seated in the lotus position, possibly the world’s first depiction of the yogi archetype – existed in the early Indus civilisations of northwest India some 4000 years ago. Whether Dravidian culture was widespread around India before Aryan cultures appeared in the north in the 2nd millennium BC, or whether the Dravidians only reached the south because the Aryans drove them from the north, is a matter of debate. But there is no question that the cushion of distance has allowed South Indian cultures to develop with little interruption from northern influences or invasions for over 2000 years.
The Tamil language was well established in Tamil Nadu by the 3rd century BC, the approximate start of the Sangam Age, when Tamil poets produced the body of classical literature known as Sangam literature. Romantic versions of the era have the region ruled by feuding poet-kings; one visitor described the Tamils as favouring rose petals over gold.
The Sangam period lasted until about AD 300, with three main Tamil dynasties arising in different parts of Tamil Nadu (Tamil Country): the early Cholas in the centre, the Cheras in the west and the Pandyas in the south.
By the 7th century the Pallavas, also Tamil, established an empire based at Kanchipuram extending from Tamil Nadu north into Andhra Pradesh. They take credit for the great stone carvings of Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram) and also constructed the region's first free-standing temples.
Next up were the medieval Cholas (whose connection with the early Cholas is hazy). Based in the Cauvery valley of central Tamil Nadu, at their peak the Cholas ruled Sri Lanka and the Maldives plus much of South India, and extended their influence to Southeast Asia, spreading Tamil ideas of reincarnation, karma and yogic practice.
The Cholas raised Dravidian architecture to new levels with the magnificent towered temples of Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram, and carried the art of bronze image casting to its peak, especially in their images of Shiva asNataraja, the cosmic dancer. Gopurams, the tall temple gate towers characteristic of Tamil Nadu today, make their appearance in late Chola times.
By the late 14th century much of Tamil Nadu was under the sway of the Vijayanagar empire based at Hampi in Karnataka. As the Vijayanagar state weakened in the 16th century, some of their local governors, the Nayaks, set up strong independent kingdoms, notably at Madurai and Thanjavur. Vijayanagar and Nayak sculptors carved wonderfully detailed statues and reliefs at many Tamil temples.
Europeans first landed on Tamil shores in the 16th century, when the Portuguese settled at San Thome. The Dutch, British, French and Danes followed in the 17th century, striking deals with local rulers to set up coastal trading colonies. Eventually it came down to the British, based at Chennai (then called Madras), against the French, based at Puducherry (then called Pondicherry), for supremacy among the colonial rivals. The British won out in the three Carnatic Wars, fought between 1744 and 1763. By the end of the 18th century British dominance over the majority of Tamil lands was assured.
The area governed by the British from Madras, the Madras Presidency, included parts of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka, an arrangement that continued after Indian Independence in 1947, until Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and present-day Tamil Nadu (130,058 sq km) were created on linguistic lines in the 1950s. It wasn't until 1968 that the current state (population 72.1 million) was officially named Tamil Nadu.
TOP STATE FESTIVALS
Pongal (statewide; hmid-Jan) marks the end of the harvest season and is one of Tamil Nadu's most important festivals, named after a rice-and-lentil dish cooked at this time in new clay pots. Animals, especially cows, are honoured for their contributions.
Other important festivals include:
International Yoga Festival (4–7 Jan, Puducherry) Shows, workshops and competitions. Thyagaraja Aradhana (Jan, Thiruvaiyaru) Carnatic music.

CHENNAI (MADRAS)
%044 / Pop 8.7 million
With its withering southern heat, roaring traffic and scarcity of outstanding sights, the ‘capital of the south’ has always been the rather dowdy sibling among India’s four biggest cities. But if you have time to explore Chennai’s diverse neighbourhoods and role as keeper of South Indian artistic and religious traditions, the odds are this 400-sq-km conglomerate of urban villages will sneak its way into your heart.
Among Chennai’s greatest assets are its people, who are infectiously enthusiastic about their hometown; they won’t hit you with a lot of hustle and hassle. Recent years have added a new layer of cosmopolitan glamour, in the shape of luxury hotels, sparkling boutiques, classy contemporary restaurants and a sprinkling of swanky bars and clubs open well into the night.
Even if you’re just caught here between connections, it’s well worth poking around the museums, exploring the temples or taking a sunset saunter along Marina Beach.
The old British Fort St George and the jumble of narrow streets and bazaars that is George Town constitute the historic hub of the city. The two main train stations, Egmore and Central, sit inland from the fort. Much of the best eating, drinking, shopping and accommodation lies in the leafier southern and southwestern suburbs such as Nungambakkam, T Nagar (Thyagaraya Nagar), Alwarpet and, increasingly, Velachery and Guindy. The major thoroughfare linking northern with southern Chennai is Anna Salai (Mount Rd).
History
The southern neighbourhood of Mylapore existed long before the rest ofThe southern neighbourhood of Mylapore existed long before the rest of Chennai and there is evidence that it traded with Roman and even Chinese and Greek merchants. The Portuguese established their San Thome settlement on the coast nearby in 1523. Another century passed before Francis Day and the British East India Company rocked up in 1639, searching for a good southeast Indian trading base, and struck a deal with the local Vijayanagar ruler to build a fort- cum–trading-post at Madraspatnam fishing village. This was Fort St George, erected between 1640 and 1653.
The three Carnatic Wars between 1744 and 1763 saw Britain and its colonialist rival France allying with competing South Indian princes in their efforts to get the upper hand over the locals – and each other. The French occupied Fort St George from 1746 to 1749 but the British eventually won out, and the French withdrew to Pondicherry.
As capital of the Madras Presidency, one of the four major divisions of British India, Madras grew into an important naval and commercial centre. After Independence, it became capital of Madras state and its successor Tamil Nadu. The city itself was renamed Chennai in 1996. Today, it's often called 'the Detroit of India' for its booming motor-vehicle industry, and it is a major IT hub.Chennai (Madras)

Housed across the British-built Pantheon Complex, this excellent museum is Chennai’s best. The big highlight is building 3, the Bronze Gallery, with a superb collection of South Indian bronzes from the 7th-century Pallava era through to modern times, and English-language explanatory material.
It was from the 9th to 11th centuries, in the Chola period, that bronze sculpture peaked. Among the Bronze Gallery's impressive pieces are many of Shiva as Nataraja, the cosmic dancer, and a superb Chola bronze of Ardhanarishvara, the androgynous incarnation of Shiva and Parvati.
The main building (No 1) has a good archaeological section representing all the major South Indian periods from 2nd-century-BC Buddhist sculptures to 16th-century-AD Vijayanagar work, with special rooms devoted to Hindu, Buddhist and Jain sculpture. Building 2, the Anthropology Galleries, traces South Indian human history back to prehistoric times, displaying tribal artefacts from across the region.
The museum also includes the National Art Gallery, Contemporary Art Gallery and Children’s Museum, on the same ticket. You may find some sections temporarily closed for renovation.

Also within the fort is St Mary's Church (

Built under the 8th-century Pallavas and unusually dedicated to Krishna (a form of Vishnu) as the charioteer Parthasarathy, this is one of Chennai's oldest temples. Most of its elaborate carvings, however, date from its 16th-century Vijayanagar expansion, including the fine colonnade fronting the main entrance. It's special for its shrines dedicated to five of the incarnations of Vishnu.

The marshmallow-pink Vivekananda House is interesting not only for its displays on the famous ‘wandering monk’, Swami Vivekananda, but also for its semicircular form, built in 1842 to store ice imported from the USA. Vivekananda stayed here briefly in 1897 and preached his ascetic Hindu philosophy to adoring crowds. The displays include a photo exhibition on the swami's life and the room where Vivekananda stayed, now used for meditation. Free weekly one-hour meditation classes may be available.
TRADITIONAL TRADERS
Even as Chennai expands relentlessly to the south, west and north, George Town, the local settlement that grew up near the British Fort St George, remains the city's wholesale centre. Many of its narrow streets are entirely devoted to selling one particular product, as they have for hundreds of years – flowers in Badrian St, paper goods in Anderson St, jewellery on NSC Bose Rd. Even if you aren't buying, wander the mazelike streets to see Indian life flowing seamlessly from the past into the present.

 ; Ponnambala Vathiar St, Mylapore; h5.30am-12.15pm & 4-9.30pm)
The Mylapore neighbourhood is one of Chennai's most characterful and traditional; it predated colonial Madras by several centuries. The Kapaleeshwarar Temple is Chennai's most active and impressive temple, believed to have been built after the Portuguese destroyed the seaside original in 1566. It displays the main architectural elements of many a Tamil Nadu temple – a rainbow-coloured gopuram (gateway tower), mandapas (pillared pavilions) and a huge tank – and is dedicated to the state's most popular deity, Shiva.
Legend tells that in an angry fit Shiva turned his consort Parvati into a peacock, and commanded her to worship him here to regain her normal form. Parvati supposedly did so at a spot just outside the northeast corner of the temple's central block, where a shrine commemorates the event. Hence the name Mylapore, or 'town of peacocks'.The temple's colourful Brahmotsavam festival (in March/April) sees the deities paraded around Mylapore's streets.

This soaring Roman Catholic cathedral, a stone's throw from the beach, was founded by the Portuguese in the 16th century, then rebuilt in neo-Gothic style in 1896, and is said to mark the final resting place of St Thomas the Apostle. It's believed 'Doubting Thomas' brought Christianity to the subcontinent in AD 52 and was killed at St Thomas Mount, Chennai, in AD 72. Behind the cathedral is
the entrance to the tomb of St Thomas ( 
h6am-8pm).

Although most of St Thomas' mortal remains are apparently now in Italy, a small cross on the tomb wall contains a tiny bone fragment marked 'Relic of St Thomas'. The museum above displays Thomas-related artefacts including the lancehead believed to have killed him.
St Thomas' Pole, at the beach end of the street on the cathedral's south side, is said to have miraculously saved the cathedral from the 2004 tsunami.

The Math is a monastic order following the teachings of the 19th-century sage Sri Ramakrishna, who preached the essential unity of all religions. The Universal Temple here is a handsome modern building incorporating architectural elements from several different religions. It’s open to all, to worship, pray or meditate.

Hotels in Chennai are pricier than in the rest of Tamil Nadu and don’t, as a rule, offer much bang for your buck. The Triplicane High Rd area is best for budget accommodation. There are some cheapies in Egmore, along with a few good midrange options. The number of top-end hotels has risen dramatically over the past couple of years, mostly in the more middle-class southern areas.Many hotels in Chennai fill up by noon, so call ahead. The most expensive hotels have good discounts online.

In business since 1951, Broad Lands was a hippie-era stalwart and probably hasn't had a fresh coat of pale-blue paint since. But this laid-back colonial-era mansion, with leafy courtyards and rooms up rambling staircases, still has its devotees, who don’t seem to mind the bare-bone, idiosyncratic rooms, dank bathrooms, or high-volume muezzins of Wallajah Big Mosque. Reception-only wi-fi (a 21st-century concession) is free.

At this ‘ecosensitive’ hotel, floors are bamboo or rubber, water and electricity conservation hold pride of place, and the AC-generated heat warms the bathroom water. The sleek, minimalist rooms are comfy and stylish, with free wi-fi; freshly revamped rooms should be ready for 2015. The rooftop supports a sea-view infinity pool (doubling as insulation) along with a restaurant.
Eating
Chennai is packed with inexpensive ‘meals’ joints (called 'messes'), servingthalis for lunch and dinner, and tiffin (snacks) such as idlis (spongy, round fermented rice cakes), vadas (deep-fried lentil-flour doughnuts) and dosas. It's perfectly possible to eat every meal at Chennai’s 24 Saravana Bhavan restaurants, where you can count on quality vegetarian food. In the Muslim area around Triplicane High Rd you’ll find great biryani stops every few steps.
Classier Indian restaurants are on the rise, and international cuisines have really taken off in Chennai, so there's plenty of upmarket dining, especially at top-end hotels.

TYPICALLY TAMIL FOOD
Tamil Nadu’s favourite foods are overwhelmingly vegetarian, full of coconut and chilli. You’ll find dosas, idlis (spongy, round fermented rice cakes) and vadas (deep-fried lentil- flour doughnuts), all served with coconut chutney and sambar (soupy lentil dish with cubed vegetables). Almost as ubiquitous is the uttapam, a thick, savoury rice pancake with finely chopped onions, green chillies and coriander. South Indian 'meals' – thalis based around rice, lentil dishes, rasam (dhal-based broth with tamarind) and chutneys, often served on banana leaves – are also good. The main local exception to the all-veg diet is Chettinad food, from the Chettinadu region south of Trichy. For a tea-growing state, Tamil Nadu adores its filter coffee, with milk, sugar, and a dash of chicory.

Drinking & Nightlife
Chennai nightlife is on the up, but you'll need a full wallet for a night out here. Chennai has possibly the most liberal licensing laws in India – for five-star hotels. Bars and clubs in these hotels serve alcohol 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that's where most of the after-dark fun happens. Solo guys (known as 'stags') can be turned away. Dress codes are strict: no shorts and sandals.
Other hotel bars, mostly male-dominated, generally close at midnight. If you're buying your own alcohol, look for new 'premium' government-run Tasmac liquor stores inside malls.

Getting There & AwayAir
Chennai International Airport (%044-22560551) is at Tirusulam in the far southwest of the city. The international terminal is about 500m west of the domestic terminal; the two are linked by a raised walkway.
There are direct flights to cities all over India, including Trichy (Tiruchirappalli), Madurai, Coimbatore and Thoothikudi (Tuticorin) within Tamil Nadu. Internationally, Chennai has plenty of direct flights to/from Colombo, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and the Gulf states. The best fares from Europe are often on Jet Airways (via Mumbai or Delhi), Qatar Airways (via Doha) or Emirates (via Dubai). Cathay Pacific flies to Hong Kong, and Maldivian to Male.

Bus
Most government buses operate from the large but surprisingly orderly CMBT
(Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus; Jawaharlal Nehru Rd, Koyambedu), 6km west of the centre. The
most comfortable and expensive are the air-con buses (and best of these are the Volvo AC services), followed by the UD (Ultra Deluxe), and these can generally be reserved in advance. There's a computerised reservation centre at the left end of the main hall, where you can book up to 60 days ahead.
The T Nagar Bus Terminus (

 ; South Usman Rd) is handyfor bus 599 to Mamallapuram (₹27, 1½ hours, every 30 minutes).
Private buses generally offer greater comfort than non-air-con government buses to many destinations, at up to double the price. Service information is available at www.redbus.in, and tickets can be booked through many travel agencies. The main terminal is the Omni bus stand (off Kaliamman Koil St, Koyambedu), 500m west of the CMBT, but some companies also pick up and drop off elsewhere in the city. Parveen Travels, for example, runs services to Bengaluru, Ernakulam (Kochi), Kodaikanal, Madurai, Ooty, Puducherry, Trichy and Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) departing from its Egmore office (

Car
Renting a car with a driver is the easiest way of getting anywhere and is easily arranged through most travel agents, midrange or top-end hotels, or the airport'spre-paid taxi desks. Sample rates for non-AC/AC cars are ₹700/800 for up to five hours and 50km, and ₹1400/1600 for up to 10 hours and 100km.

To/From the Airport
The Chennai Metro Rail system, expected to open in late 2015, will provide a cheap, easy link between the airport and city. Meanwhile, the cheapest option isa suburban train to/from Tirusulam station opposite the parking areas of the domestic terminal, accessed by a pedestrian subway under the highway. Trains run every 10 to 20 minutes from 4am to midnight to/from Chennai Beach station (₹5, 42 minutes) with stops including Kodambakkam, Egmore, Chennai Park and Chennai Fort.
Pre-paid taxi kiosks outside the airport's international terminal charge
₹480/580 for a non-AC/AC cab to Egmore, and ₹400/500 to T Nagar. Rates are slightly lower at pre-paid taxi kiosks outside the domestic terminal.
From the CMBT, city buses 70 and 170 to Tambaram stop on the highway across from the airport.
Autorickshaw
Fixed autorickshaw fares are ₹25 for the first 1.8km (minimum charge), then
₹12 per kilometre. Some drivers still refuse to use their meters and quote astronomical fares, while others take unnecessarily long routes or ask for 'meter plus extra', but most will go by the meter if you insist. Avoid paying upfront, and always establish the meter is on before getting into a rickshaw. Rates rise by up to 50% from 11pm to 5am.
There are pre-paid autorickshaw booths outside the CMBT (₹125 to Egmore) and Central station, and 24-hour pre-paid stands with fare charts outside the north and south exits of Egmore station.
Tempting offers of ₹50 ‘city tours’ by autorickshaw drivers sound too good to be true. They are. You'll spend the day being dragged from one shop or emporium to another.
Bus
Chennai’s city bus system is worth getting to know, although buses get packed to overflowing at busy times. Fares are between ₹3 and ₹14 (up to double for express and deluxe services, and multiplied by five for Volvo AC services). Route information is online at http://busroutes.in/chennai.Metro Rail
Chennai Metro Rail, a new, part-underground rapid transit system, is expected to open in late 2015 and should make moving around the city much easier. Line 1 goes from the airport to Teynampet, Thousand Lights, Central train station, the High Court and Washermanpet in northern Chennai, running beneath Anna Salai for several kilometres. Line 2 goes from Central train station west to Egmore and the CMBT then south to St Thomas Mount.
Taxi
Both airport terminals have pre-paid taxi kiosks. There's a pre-paid taxi stand
(

GOOGLE MAP
 ; Egmore Station ; h4am-1pm) outside the south side of Egmore
station; a ride of 7km, such as to Alwarpet, costs about ₹240.Relatively reliable Fast Track (%60006000) taxis charge ₹100 for up to 4km, then ₹18 per kilometre (with a 25% hike in rates between 11pm and 5am); bookings are by phone.
Train
Efficient, cheap suburban trains run from Beach station to Fort, Park (near Central station), Egmore, Chetpet, Nungambakkam, Kodambakkam, Mambalam, Saidapet, Guindy, St Thomas Mount, Tirusulam (for the airport), and on down to Tambaram. At Egmore station, the suburban platforms (10 and 11) and ticket office are on the north side of the station. A second line branches south after Fort to Park Town, Chepauk, Tiruvallikeni (for Marina Beach), Light House and Thirumailai (near Kapaleeshwarar Temple). Trains run from 4am to midnight, several times hourly; rides cost ₹5 to ₹10.
NORTHERN TAMIL NADU
Chennai to Mamallapuram
Chennai’s sprawl peters out after an hour or so heading south on the East Coast Road (ECR), at which point Tamil Nadu becomes red dirt, blue skies, palm trees, and green fields, sprinkled with towns and villages (or, if you take the 'IT Expressway' inland, huge new buildings).
Swimming along the coast is dangerous due to strong currents. 1 Sights & Activities

Tiger Cave
(Saluvankuppam; admission free; h6am-6pm)
SACRED HINDU SITE
Just 5km north of Mamallapuram, the Tiger Cave is an unfinished but impressive rock-cut shrine, probably dating from the 7th century and dedicated to Durga (a form of Devi, Shiva's wife). What's special is the 'necklace' of 11 monstrous tiger-like heads framing its central shrine-cavity. At the north end of the park-like complex is a rock-cut Shiva shrine from the same era. Beyond the fence lies the more recently excavated Subrahmanya Temple, comprising an 8th-century granite shrine built over a Sangam-era brick temple dedicated to Murugan, which is one of the oldest known temples in Tamil Nadu.Covelong Point

SURFING
The fishing village of Kovalam, 20km north of Mamallapuram, has recently sprung into the spotlight for having probably the best surfing waves on the Tamil Nadu coast. For classes or surf companionship, head to 'social surfing school' Covelong Point, run by Kovalam's original local surf pioneer Murthy. Kovalam also hosts the hugely popular Covelong Point Surf & Music Festival (www.covelongpoint.com; hSep), now into its second year.
8 Getting There & Away To reach these places, take any bus heading south from Chennai to Mamallapuram and ask to be let off at the appropriate point(s). The TTDC’s Chennai–Mamallapuram round-trip bus tour (₹450 to ₹550, 10 hours) visits several of the sites and Mamallapuram itself. A full-day taxi tour from Chennai costs around ₹3000.
Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram)
%044 / Pop 15,172
Mamallapuram was the major seaport of the ancient Pallava kingdom based at Kanchipuram, and a wander round the town’s magnificent, World Heritage– listed temples and carvings inflames the imagination, especially at sunset.
And then, in addition to ancient archaeological wonders and coastal beauty, there’s the traveller ghetto of Othavadai and Othavadai Cross Sts. Restaurants serve pasta, pizza and pancakes, shops sell hand sanitiser and things from Tibet, and you know you have landed, once again, in the great Kingdom of Backpackistan.
‘Mahabs’, as most call it, is under two hours by bus from Chennai, and many travellers make a beeline straight here. The town is small and laid-back, and its sights can be explored on foot or by bicycle.Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram)

1 Sights You can easily spend a full day exploring Mamallapuram's marvellous temples and rock carvings.
Most of them were carved from the rock during the 7th- century reign of Pallava king Narasimhavarman I, whose nickname Mamalla (Great Wrestler) gave the town its name. Apart from the Shore Temple and the Five Rathas, admission is free. Official Archaeological Survey of India guides can be hired at sites for around ₹100.
o Shore Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
(

GOOGLE MAP
 ; combined 1-day ticket with Five Rathas Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video ₹25;
h6am-6pm)
Standing like a magnificent fist of rock-cut elegance overlooking the sea, the two-towered Shore Temple symbolises the heights of Pallava architecture and the maritime ambitions of the Pallava kings. Its small size belies its excellent proportion and the supreme quality of the carvings, many of which have been eroded into vaguely Impressionist embellishments. Built under Narasimhavarman II in the 8th century, it's the earliest significant free-standing stone temple in Tamil Nadu.
The two towers rise above shrines to Shiva, and their original linga (phallic symbols of Shiva) captured the sunrise and sunset. Between the Shiva shrines is one to Vishnu, shown sleeping. Rows of Nandi (Shiva's vehicle) statues frame the temple courtyard.
o Five Rathas
(Pancha Ratha; 
HINDU TEMPLE
GOOGLE MAP
 ; Five Rathas Rd; combined 1-day ticket with Shore Temple
Indian/foreigner ₹10/250, video ₹25; h6am-6pm)Huddled together at the southern end of Mamallapuram, the Five Rathas look like buildings, but they were, astonishingly, all carved from single large rocks. Each of these 7th-century temples was dedicated to a Hindu god and is now named after one or more of the Pandavas, the five hero-brothers of the epic Mahabharata, or their common wife, Draupadi. The rathas were hidden in the sand until excavated by the British 200 years ago.
Ratha is Sanskrit for chariot, and may refer to the temples' form or to their function as vehicles for the gods. It's thought they didn't originally serve as actual places of worship, but were created as architectural models.
The first ratha on the left after you enter the gate is the Draupadi Ratha (
GOOGLE MAP
 ), in the form of a stylised South Indian hut. It's dedicated to the
demon-fighting goddess Durga, who looks out from inside, standing on a lotus. A huge sculpted lion, Durga's mount, stands guard outside.
Next, on the same plinth, is the 'chariot' of the most important Pandava, the
Arjuna Ratha ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), dedicated to Shiva. Its pilasters, miniature roof
shrines, and small octagonal dome make it a precursor of many later temples in South India. A huge Nandi stands behind. Shiva and other gods are depicted on the temple's outer walls.
The barrel-roofed Bhima Ratha ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) was never completed, as is
evidenced by the missing colonnade on its north side. Inside is a shrine to
Vishnu. The Dharmaraja Ratha ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), tallest of the temples, is
similar in form to the Arjuna Ratha but one storey higher. The carvings on its outer walls mostly represent gods, including the androgynous Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati) on the east side. King Narasimhavarman I appears at the west end of the south side.
The Nakula-Sahadeva Ratha ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ) (named after two twin
Pandavas) stands aside from the other four and is dedicated to Indra. The life- size stone elephant beside it is one of the most perfectly sculpted elephants in India. Approaching from the gate to the north you see its back end first, hence its nickname Gajaprishthakara (elephant’s backside).
o Arjuna’s Penance
HINDU, MONUMENT( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; West Raja St)
The crowning masterpiece of Mamallapuram’s stonework, this giant relief carving is one of India's greatest ancient art works. Inscribed on two huge, adjacent boulders, the Penance bursts with scenes of Hindu myth and everyday vignettes of South Indian life. In the centre nagas (snake-beings), descend a once water-filled cleft, representing the Ganges. To the left Arjuna (hero of the Mahabharata) performs self-mortification (fasting on one leg), so that the four- armed Shiva will grant him his most powerful weapon, the god-slaying Pasupata.
Some scholars believe the carving shows not Arjuna but the sage Bagiratha, who did severe penance to obtain Shiva's help in bringing the Ganges to earth. Shiva is attended by dwarves, and celestial beings fly across the upper parts of the carving. Below Arjuna/Bagiratha is a temple to Vishnu, mythical ancestor of the Pallava kings. The many wonderfully carved animals include a herd of elephants and – humour amid the holy – a cat mimicking Arjuna's penance to a crowd of mice.
South along the road from Arjuna's Penance are the unfinished Panch
Pandava Mandapa (

Krishna Mandapa (

depicts Krishna lifting Govardhana Hill to protect cows and villagers from a
storm sent by Indra; an unfinished relief carving (

 ) of
similar size to Arjuna's Penance; and the Dharmaraja Cave Temple ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ; h6.30am-6pm).
MAMALLAPURAM HILL
Many interesting monuments are scattered across the rock-strewn hill on the west side of town. It takes about an hour to walk round the main ones. The hill area is open from 6am to 6pm and has two entrances: a northern one on West Raja St, and a southern one just off Five Rathas Rd.
Straight ahead inside the northern entrance you can't miss the huge boulder with the
inspired name of Krishna’s Butterball ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), immovable but
apparently balancing precariously. Pass between the rocks north of here to the Trimurti
Cave Temple ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), honouring the Hindu 'trinity': Brahma (left),Shiva (centre) and Vishnu (right). On the back of the same rock is a beautiful group of carved elephants.
Back south of Krishna's Butterball you reach the Ganesh Ratha ( 
MAP
GOOGLE MAP
 ), carved from a single rock with lion-shaped pillar bases. Once a Shiva
temple, it became a shrine to Ganesh (Shiva’s elephant-headed son) after the original
lingam was removed. Southwest of here, the Varaha Mandapa ( 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 )
houses some of Mamallapuram's finest carvings. The left panel shows Vishnu's boar avatar, Varaha, lifting the earth out of the oceans. The outward-facing panels show Vishnu's consort Lakshmi (washed by elephants) and Durga, while the right-hand panel has Vishnu in his eight-armed giant form, Trivikrama, overcoming the demon king Bali.
A little further south, then up to the left, is the 16th-century Raya Gopura (Olakkanatha
Temple; 
MAP   GOOGLE MAP
 ), probably an unfinished gopuram. West just up the hill is
the finely carved Lion Throne (

 ), carved from the rock with excellent scenes from the Puranas
(Sanskrit stories from the 5th century AD). The left-side panel shows Vishnu sleeping on the coils of a snake; on the right, Durga bestrides her lion vehicle while killing the demon- buffalo Mahisha. Inside the central shrine, Murugan is depicted sitting between his parents Shiva and Parvati.2 Activities
Beaches
The beach fronting the village isn’t exactly pristine, but south of the Shore Temple it clears into finer sand. You’ll also be further away from the leers of men who spend their days gawking at tourists. Like most of Tamil Nadu's coast, these beaches aren't great for swimming, due to dangerous rips.

Some years as many as 100,000 birds mass at Vedanthangal Lake and its marshy surrounds. The top viewing times are dawn and late afternoon.

Owned by snake-man Rom Whitaker and writer Janaki Lenin, it's packed with wildlife (you can help track the local leopard), and has three simple, comfy bamboo huts on stilts.
Some visitors make a taxi day trip to Vedanthangal from Mamallapuram, for around ₹2200. On public transport, first go to Chengalpattu, an hour’s bus ride from Mamallapuram en route to Kanchipuram, then take a bus to Vedanthangal via Padalam (possibly changing buses again) Most Vedanthangal buses go to the sanctuary entrance(possibly changing buses again).

Kanchipuram, 80km southwest of Chennai, was capital of the Pallava dynasty during the 6th to 8th centuries, when the Pallavas created the great stone monuments of Mamallapuram. Today a typically hectic modern Indian town, it's famed for its numerous important and vibrant temples, some dating from Pallava, Chola or Vijayanagar times, and also for its high-quality silk saris, woven on hand looms by thousands of families in the city and nearby villages. Silk and sari shops are strung along Gandhi Rd, southeast of the centre, though their wares are generally no cheaper than at Chennai silk shops. Kanchi is easily visited in a day trip from Mamallapuram or Chennai.Kanchipuram

HINDU TEMPLE

 ; h6am-noon & 4-8pm)
Kanchi's oldest temple is its most impressive, not for its size but for its weight of historical presence and the intricacy of its stonework. As much monument as living temple, Kailasanatha is quieter than other temples in town, and has seen a lot of restoration. Dedicated to Shiva, it was built in the 8th century by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman II, who also gave us Mamallapuram's Shore Temple.
The low-slung sandstone compound has fascinating carvings, including many of the half-animal deities in vogue in early Dravidian architecture. Note the rearing lions on the outer walls. The inner sanctum is centred on a large 16-sided lingam, which non-Hindus can view from about 8m away. The tower rising above it is a precursor of the great vimanas of later Chola temples. An autorickshaw from the centre costs ₹40, but walking is nice.Ekambareshwara Temple

Of the five South Indian Shiva temples associated with the five elements, this 12-hectare precinct is the shrine of earth. You enter beneath the 59m-high, unpainted south gopuram, whose lively carvings were chiselled in 1509 under Vijayanagar rule. Inside, a columned hall leads left into the central compound, which Nandi faces from the right. The inner sanctum (Hindus only) contains a lingam made of earth and a mirror chamber whose central Shiva image is reflected in endless repetition.
According to legend, the goddess Kamakshi (She Whose Eyes Awaken Desire; a form of Parvati, Shiva's consort) worshipped Shiva under a mango tree here. In a courtyard behind the inner sanctum you can see a mango tree said to be 2500 years old, with four branches representing the four Vedas (sacred Hindu texts).
Tamil Nadu is home to three more of South India's five elemental Shiva temples: Arunachaleshwar Temple in Tiruvannamalai (fire), Nataraja Temple in Chidambaram (space) and Sri Jambukeshwara Temple in Trichy (water). The fifth is Sri Kalahasteeswara Temple (air), in Andhra Pradesh.

It's thought to have been founded by the Pallavas. The entire main building inside is off-limits to non-Hindus, but the small, square marriage hall, to the right inside the temple’s southeast entrance, has wonderfully ornate pillars. You might catch the temple elephant giving blessings just inside this entrance.

Non-Hindus cannot enter the central compound, but the artistic highlight is the 16th-century ‘100-pillared’ marriage hall, just inside the western entrance. Its pillars (actually 96) are superbly carved with animals and monsters; at its corners hang four stone chains, each carved from a single rock.
Every 40 years the waters of the temple tank are drained, revealing a huge wooden statue of Vishnu that is worshipped for 48 days. Next viewing: 2019.

TAMIL NADU TEMPLES
Tamil Nadu is a gold mine for anyone wanting to explore Indian temple culture. Not only does it have some of the country's most spectacular temple architecture and sculpture, but few parts of India are as fervent in their worship of the Hindu gods as Tamil Nadu. Its 5000-odd temples are constantly abuzz with worshippers flocking in for puja (offering or prayer), and colourful temple festivals abound. Among the plethora of Hindu deities, Shiva probably has most Tamil temples dedicated to him, in a multitude of forms including Nataraja, the cosmic dancer, who dances in a ring of fire with two of his four hands holding the flame of destruction and the drum of creation, while the third makes the abhaya mudra (fear not) gesture and the fourth points to the dwarf of ignorance being trampled beneath Shiva's foot. Tamils also have a soft spot for Shiva's peacock- riding son Murugan (also Kartikeya or Skanda), who is intricately associated with their cultural identity.
The special significance of many Tamil temples makes them goals of countless Hindu pilgrims from all over India. The Pancha Sabhai Sthalangal are the five temples where Shiva is believed to have performed his cosmic dance (chief among them Chidambaram). Then there's the Pancha Bootha Sthalangal, the five temples where Shiva is worshipped as one of the five elements – land, water, sky/space, fire and air (this last in Andhra Pradesh). Each of the nine Navagraha temples in the Kumbakonam area is the abode of one of the nine celestial bodies of Hindu astronomy – key sites given the importance of astrology in Hindu faith.
Typical Tamil temple design features tall layered entrance towers called gopurams,encrusted with often colourfully painted sculptures of gods and demons; halls of richly carved columns called mandapas; a sacred water tank; and a series of compounds (prakarams), one within the next, with the innermost containing the central sanctum where the temple's main deity resides. The earliest Tamil temples were small rock-cut shrines; the first free-standing temples were built in the 8th century AD; gopurams first appeared around the 12th century.
Admission to most temples is free, but non-Hindus are often not allowed inside inner sanctums, which can be disappointing for travellers. At other temples priests may invite you in and in no time you are doing puja, having an auspicious tilak mark daubed on your forehead and being asked for a donation.
Temple touts can be a nuisance, but there are also many excellent guides who deserve both your time and rupees; use your judgement, talk to other travellers and be on the lookout for badge-wearing official guides.

For a dusty bazaar town, Vellore feels pretty cosmopolitan, thanks to a couple of tertiary institutions and the American-founded Christian Medical College (CMC), one of India's finest hospitals, attracting both medical students and patients from across the country.

FORTcentury and passed through Maratha and Mughal hands before the British occupied it in 1760. These days it houses, among other things, the magnificent Vijayanagar-era Jalakantesvara Temple, two museums, two parade grounds, a church, government offices, and a police recruiting school.
Inside, the Jalakantesvara Temple (h6.30am-1pm & 3-8.30pm), a gem of late Vijayanagar architecture, dates from around 1566, and was once occupied as a garrison. Check out the small, detailed sculptures – especially the yali (mythical lion creatures) – on the walls and columns of the marriage hall in the southwest corner. The dusty exhibits in the Government Museum (Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h9.30am-5pm Sat-Thu) have seen better days, but the Archaeological Survey Museum (h9am-5pm Sat-Thu) has a good collection of Pallava, Chola and Nayak stone sculptures, plus displays on the 1806 Vellore Mutiny, the earliest anti- British uprising by Indian troops.

At every full moon 'Tiru' swells with thousands of pilgrims who come to circumnavigate the base of Arunachala in a purifying ritual known as Girivalam, but at any time you’ll see Shaivite priests, sadhus (spiritual men) and devotees gathered around the Arunachaleshwar Temple. Tiru's reputation for strong spiritual energies has produced numerous ashrams, and it now attracts ever- growing numbers of spiritual-minded travellers.

HINDU TEMPLE
This 10-hectare temple is one of the largest in India. Its oldest parts date back to the 9th century and the site was a place of worship long before that. Four huge,unpainted white gopurams mark the entrances, with the main, eastern one rising 13 storeys and an astonishing 66m. During festivals the Arunachaleshwar is awash in golden flames and the roasting scent of burning ghee, as befits the fire incarnation of the Destroyer of the Universe.
Inside the complex are five more gopurams, a 1000-pillared hall with impressive carvings, two tanks and a profusion of sub-temples and shrines. There's a helpful temple model inside the second gopuram from the east, where the temple elephant gives blessings. To reach the innermost sanctum, with its huge lingam, worshippers must pass through five surrounding prakarams (compounds).

MOUNTAIN
 
This 800m-high extinct volcano dominates Tiruvannamalai and local conceptions of the element of fire, which supposedly finds its sacred abode in Arunachala’s heart. Devout barefoot pilgrims, especially on full-moon and festival days, make the 14km circumambulation of the mountain, stopping at eight famous linga along the route. The inner path was closed at research time, but it's still possible to circle around on the main road, or climb the hill past two caves where Sri Ramana Maharshi lived and meditated from 1899 to 1922.
The hot ascent to the top opens up superb views of Tiruvannamalai, and takes five or six hours round-trip: start early and take water. An unsigned path across the road from the northwest corner of Arunachaleshwar Temple leads the way up past homes and the two caves, Virupaksha (about 20 minutes up) and Skandasramam (30 minutes). Women are advised not to do the hike alone.
If you aren't that devoted, buy a Giripradakshina map (₹15) from the bookshop at Sri Ramana Ashram, hire a bicycle on the roadside nearby (per day ₹40), and ride your way around. Or make an autorickshaw circuit for about ₹250 (up to double at busy times).
Sri Ramana Ashram
ASHRAM
(Sri Ramanasramam; %9244937292; www.sriramanamaharshi.org; Chengam Rd; hoffice 7.30am- 12.30pm & 2-6.30pm)This tranquil ashram, 2km southwest of the centre in green grounds filled with peacocks, draws devotees of Sri Ramana Maharshi, one of the first Hindu gurus to gain an international following, who died here in 1950 after half a century in contemplation. Visitors can meditate or attend daily pujas (prayers) and chantings, mostly in the samadhi hall where the guru's body is enshrined.
A limited amount of free accommodation (donations accepted; three to four weeks) is available for devotees only: write or email a month ahead.
Sri Seshadri Swamigal Ashram
(%04175-236999; www.tiruvarunaimahan.org; Chengam Rd; hoffice 9am-1pm & 4-8.30pm)
ASHRAM
Dedicated to a contemporary and helper of Sri Ramana, with meditation platforms and some accommodation. It's in the southwest of town next to Sri Ramana Ashram.
Sri Anantha Niketan
(%09003480013; www.sriananthaniketan.com; Periya Paliyapattu Village; by donations)
ASHRAM
A place for organised retreats rather than a permanent community, Sri Anantha Niketan has tree-shaded grounds, wonderful Arunachala views, homey rooms and weekend chanting in an attractive meditation hall. It's just off the Krishnagiri road, 7km west of town. Book well ahead for November to February.
THE LINGAM OF FIRE
Legend has it Shiva appeared as the original lingam of fire on Mt Arunachala to restore light to the world after his consort Parvati playfully plunged everything into darkness by closing his eyes. The Karthikai Deepam Festival (statewide; hNov/Dec) celebrates this legend throughout India but becomes particularly significant at Tiruvannamalai. The lighting of a huge fire atop Mt Arunachala on the full moon night, from a 30m wick immersed in 3 tonnes of ghee, culminates a 10-day festival for which hundreds of thousands of people converge on Tiruvannamalai. Huge crowds scale the mountain or circumnavigate its base, chanting Shiva's name. The sun is relentless, the rocks are jagged and the journey is barefoot – none of which deters the thousands of pilgrims who joyfully make their way to the top and the abode of their deity.4 Sleeping & Eating Most visitors stay in the less hectic Chengam Rd area, but there are also typical temple-town options near the Arunachaleshwar Temple. During Karthikai Deepam (November/December) prices can multiply several times. Hotels get heavily booked at full moon.

8 Getting There & Around A taxi to Puducherry with a two-to three-hour stop at Gingee costs around ₹2800.
The bus stand is 800m north of the Arunachaleshwar Temple, and a ₹50 to ₹60 autorickshaw ride from the main ashram area.A Chennai (₹110, four hours, every 15 minutes) A Puducherry (₹63, three hours, about hourly) A Trichy (₹125, six hours, about hourly) A Vellore (₹50, two hours, every 15 minutes)
Gingee (Senji)
With three separate hilltop citadels and a 6km perimeter of cliffs and thick walls,
the ruins of enormous Gingee Fort (%04145-222072; Indian/foreigner ₹5/100; h8am-
5pm) rise out of the Tamil plain, 37km east of Tiruvannamalai, like something misplaced from The Lord of the Rings. The fort was constructed mainly in the 16th century by the Vijayanagars and later occupied by the Marathas, Mughals, French and the British before being abandoned in the 19th century.
Today, few foreigners make it here, but Gingee is popular with domestic tourists for its starring role in various films. The main road from Tiruvannamalai towards Puducherry slices through the fort, just before Gingee town. The easiest citadel to reach, Krishnagiri , lies north of the road. To the south are the highest of the three, Rajagiri , and the most distant and least interesting, Chakklidurg. Ticket offices are at the foot of Krishnagiri and Rajagiri.
Remains of numerous buildings stand in the site's lower parts, especially at the bottom of Rajagiri, where the main landmark of the old palace area is the white, restored, seven-storey Kalyana Mahal (Marriage Hall). Just east of the palace area is an 18th-century mosque ; southeast of that is the abandoned 16th- century Venkataramana Temple .
It’s a good hike to the top of Krishnagiri and even more so to the top of more popular Rajagiri (over 150m above the plain), and you need at least half a day to cover both hills. Start early and bring water; hill-climbing entry ends at 2.30pm.
Gingee is on the Tiruvannamalai–Puducherry bus route, with buses from Tiruvannamalai (₹23, one hour) about every 15 minutes. Get off at the fort to save a trip back out from Gingee town.
Puducherry (Pondicherry)%0413 / Pop 244,377
Puducherry (formerly called Pondicherry and generally referred to as ‘Pondy’) was under French rule until 1954 and some people here still speak French (and English with French accents). Hotels, restaurants and ‘lifestyle’ shops sell a seductive vision of the French-subcontinental aesthetic, enhanced by Gallic creative types whose presence has in turn attracted Indian artists and designers. Thus Pondy’s vibe: less faded colonial-era ville, more a bohemian-chic, New Age–cum–Old World hang-out on the international travel trail.
If you've come from Chennai or some of Tamil Nadu's inland cities, Pondy may well seem a sea of tranquility. The older part of this former French colony (where you'll probably spend most of your time) is full of quiet, clean, shady cobbled streets, lined with bougainvillea-draped colonial-era townhouses numbered in an almost logical manner. The newer side of town is typically, hectically South Indian.
Part of the vibe stems from the presence of the internationally famous Sri Aurobindo Ashram and its offshoot just out of town, Auroville, which draw large numbers of spiritually minded visitors.
Enjoy the shopping, the French food (hello steak!), the beer (au revoir Tamil Nadu alcohol taxes – Pondy is a Union Territory), the sea air and plenty of yoga and meditation.
Puducherry is split from north to south by a partially covered canal. The ‘French’ part of town is on the east side (towards the sea). Nehru (JN) St and Lal Bahadur Shastri St (Rue Bussy) are the main east–west streets; Mahatma Gandhi (MG) Rd and Mission St (Cathedral St) are the chief north–south thoroughfares. Many streets change names as they go along and often have English, French and Tamil names simultaneously.Puducherry (Pondicherry)1 Sights

NEIGHBOURHOOD
 
Pocketed away just behind the seafront is a series of cobbled streets, white-and- mustard buildings in various states of romantic dishevelment, and a slight sense of Gallic glory gone by, otherwise known as the French Quarter. A do-it-yourself heritage walk could start at the French Consulate (

 ; Goubert Ave)
Pondy is a seaside town, but that doesn’t make it a beach destination; the city’s sand is a thin strip of dirty brown that slurps into a seawall of jagged rocks. But Goubert Ave (Beach Rd) is a killer stroll, especially at dawn and dusk when half the town takes a romantic wander there. In a stroke of genius the city council has banned traffic here from 6pm to 7.30am.
There are a few sandy beaches north and south of town, but they aren't really good for sunbathing due to crowds of men, and possible undertow or rip tides make swimming risky.

Founded in 1926 by Sri Aurobindo and a French-born woman known as ‘the Mother’, this spiritual community now has about 1200 members working in its many departments. Aurobindo's teachings focus on an 'integral yoga' as the path towards a 'supramental consciousness which will divinise human nature'; devotees work in the world, rather than retreating from it. General visits to the,
g
main ashram building are cursory – you just see the flower-festooned samadhi of Aurobindo and the Mother, then the bookshop, then you leave.
Ashram accommodation guests can access other areas and activities. Evening meditation around the samadhi is open to people with passes – which you can only get if you're staying at an ashram guesthouse or from the ashram's Bureau

5 Eating Puducherry is a culinary highlight of Tamil Nadu; you get great South Indian cooking plus well- prepped French and Italian cuisine. If you’ve been missing cheese or have a craving for pâté, you’re in luck, and everyone in the French Quarter does good brewed coffee and crepes.

from the French Quarter. For Kumbakonam, change at Chidambaram. Further services run from Villupuram (₹18, one hour, every 10 minutes), 38km west of Puducherry. Private bus companies, operating mostly overnight to various destinations, have offices along Maraimalai Adigal Salai west of the bus stand.

TRAIN
Puducherry station has just a few services. Two daily trains go to Chennai Egmore, with unreserved seating only (₹45 to ₹75, four to five hours). You can connect at Villupuram for many more services north and south. The station has a computerised booking office for trains throughout India.
8 Getting Around Pondy's flat streets are great for getting around on foot. Autorickshaws are plentiful. Official metered fares are ₹40 for up to 2km and then ₹15 per kilometre, but most drivers refuse to use their meters. A trip from the bus stand to the French Quarter costs around ₹60.
A good way to explore Pondy and around is by rented bicycle or motorbike
from outlets (

Auroville
%0413 / Pop 2345
Auroville, 'the City of Dawn', is one of those ideas that anyone with idealistic leanings will love: an international community dedicated to peace, harmony, sustainable living, and 'divine consciousness', where people from across the globe, ignoring creed, colour and nationality, work together to build a universal,g      ,g        g         ,
y,             g
,
cash-free, non-religious township and realise good old human unity.
Outside opinions of Auroville's inhabitants range from admiration to accusations of self-indulgent escapism. Imagine over 100 small settlements scattered across the Tamil countryside, with 2300-odd residents of 43 nationalities. Nearly 60% of Aurovillians are foreign, and most new members require more funds than most Indians are ever likely to have. But the vibe you'll receive on a visit will probably be positive, and the energy driving the place is palpable.
Some 12km northwest of Puducherry, Auroville was founded in 1968 on the inspiration of 'the Mother', co-founder of Puducherry's Sri Aurobindo Ashram, and her philosophy still guides it. Aurovillians run a huge variety of projects ranging from schools and IT to organic farming, renewable energy and handicrafts production, employing 4000 to 5000 people from nearby villages.
The Auroville website (www.auroville.org) is an encyclopedic resource.1 Sights & Activities Auroville isn't really geared for tourism – most inhabitants are just busy getting on with their lives – but it does have a good visitors centre (%0413- 2622239; h9am-1pm & 1.30-5pm) with information services, exhibitions and Auroville products. You can buy a handbook and map (₹20), and watch a 10-minute video. Free passes for external viewing of the Matrimandir (hpasses issued 9.30am-4.45pm Mon-Sat, 9.30am-12.45pm Sun), Auroville's 'soul', a 1km walk away through the woodlands, are also handed out here.
The large, golden, almost spherical Matrimandir is often said to resemble a golf ball, on a bed of lotus petals. You might equally feel that its grand simplicity, surrounded by pristine green parkland, does indeed evoke the divine consciousness it's supposed to represent. The orb's main inner chamber, lined with white marble, houses a large glass crystal that suffuses a beam of sunlight around the chamber. It's a place for individual silent concentration and if, after viewing the Matrimandir from the gardens, you want to meditate inside, you must book in person at least one day ahead at the Matrimandir access office
(%0413-2622204; Visitors Centre; h10-11am & 2-3pm Wed-Mon).
Visitors are perfectly free to wander round Auroville's 10-sq-km network of roads and tracks. With two million trees planted since Auroville's foundation, it's a lovely shaded area.
If you're interested in getting to know Auroville, residents recommend you stay at least 10 days and join one of the introduction and orientation programs. To get seriously involved, you normally need to come as a volunteer for two to 12 months. Contact the Auroville Guest Service (%0413-2622675;
www.aurovilleguestservice.org; Solar Kitchen Bldg, 2km east of Visitors Centre; h9.30am-1pm Mon-Sat)
for advice on active participation.
4 Sleeping & Eating Auroville has over 50 guesthouses(per person ₹250-4500) of hugely varied comfort levels, offering from two to 50 beds. The Guest Accommodation Service (%0413-2622704; www.aurovilleguesthouses.org; Visitors Centre; h9.30am-12.30pm & 2-5pm) can advise you, but bookings are done directly with individual guesthouses. For the peak seasons, December to March and August and September, reservations three or four months ahead are recommended.
The Right Path Cafe (Visitors Centre; mains ₹175-295; h8am-8.30pm Tue-Sun, 8am-
4.45pm Mon ), open to all, serves decent Indian and Continental food.
8 Getting There & Away The main turning to Auroville from the East Coast Rd is at Periyar Mudaliarchavadi village, 6km north of Puducherry. From there it's about 6km west to the visitors centre. An autorickshaw one way from Puducherry is about ₹250, or you can take a Kottukuppam bus northbound on Ambour Salai to the Auroville turnoff (₹6 to ₹20, every 10 minutes), then an autorickshaw for ₹150. Otherwise, rent a bicycle or motorcycle from outlets on northern Mission St in Puducherry.
CENTRAL TAMIL NADU
Chidambaram
%04144 / Pop 62,153
There’s basically one reason to visit Chidambaram: the great temple complex of Nataraja, Shiva as the Dancer of the Universe. One of the holiest of all Shiva sites, this also happens to be a Dravidian architectural highlight.
Most accommodation is close to the temple or the bus stand (500m southeast of the temple). The train station is about 1km further southeast.1 Sights
o Nataraja Temple
(hinner compound 6am-noon & 4.30-10pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
According to legend, Shiva and Kali got into a dance-off judged by Vishnu. Shiva dropped an earring and picked it up with his foot, a move that Kali could not duplicate, so Shiva won the title Nataraja (Lord of the Dance). It is in this form that he is worshipped at this great temple, which draws an endless stream of worshippers. It was built during Chola times (Chidambaram was a Chola capital), but the main shrines date back to at least the 6th century.
The high-walled 22-hectare complex has four towering gopurams decked out in Dravidian stone and stucco work. The main entrance is through the east (oldest) gopuram, off East Car St. The 108 sacred positions of classical Tamil dance are carved in its passageway. To your right through the gopuram are the 1000-pillared Raja Sabha (King’s Hall; hfestival days), and the large Sivaganga tank.
You enter the central compound (no cameras) from the east. In its southern part (left from the entrance) is the 13th-century Nritta Sabha (Dance Hall), shaped like a chariot with 56 finely carved pillars. Some say this is the very spot where Shiva outdanced Kali.
North of the Nritta Sabha, through a door, you enter the inner courtyard. Right in front is the Kanaka Sabha pavilion, where many temple rituals are performed. At puja times devotees crowd into and around the pavilion to witness the rites performed by the temple's hereditary Brahmin priests, the Dikshithars, who shave off some of their hair but grow the rest of it long (thus representing both Shiva and Parvati) and tie it into topknots.
Behind (north of) the Kanaka Sabha is the innermost sanctum, the golden- roofed Chit Sabha (Wisdom Hall), which holds the temple's central bronze image of Nataraja – Shiva the cosmic dancer, ending one cycle of creation, beginning another and uniting all opposites.
Priests may offer to guide you around the temple complex. Since they work as a kind of cooperative to fund the temple, you may wish to support this magnificent building by hiring one (for anything between ₹30 and ₹300,depending on language skills and knowledge). Unusually for Tamil Nadu, the temple is privately funded and managed.
z Festivals & Events Of the town's many festivals, the two largest are the 10-day chariot festivals (hJun-Jul & Dec- Jan).
Natyanjali Dance Festival
(hFeb-Mar)
DANCE
Chidambaram's five-day dance festival attracts 300 to 400 classical dancers from all over India to the Nataraja Temple.
4 Sleeping & Eating Many cheap pilgrims’ lodges are clustered around the temple, but some are pretty grim. If there’s anywhere really nice to stay in Chidambaram, we haven’t found it yet. There are plenty of cheap veg eats surrounding the temple, but the best places for meals are hotels.

OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
TRANQUIL TRANQUEBAR (THARANGAMBADI)
South of Chidambaram the many-armed delta of the Cauvery River stretches 180km along the coast and deep into the hinterland. The Cauvery is the beating heart of Tamil agriculture and its valley was the heartland of the Chola empire. Today the delta is one of the prettiest, poorest and most traditional parts of Tamil Nadu.
The tiny coastal town of Tharangambadi, still mostly known by its old name Tranquebar, is easily the most appealing base. A great place to recharge from the hot, crowded towns inland, this former Danish colony is quiet, neat, and set right on a long sandy beach with a few fishing boats and delicious sea breezes. It's said the air here is especially ozone-rich. The old part of town inside the 1791 Landporten gate makes a brilliantly peaceful stroll, and has been significantly restored since the 2004 tsunami, which killed about 800 people here. Intach Pondicherry (www.intachpondicherry.org) has a good downloadable map. The old Danish fort, Dansborg (Indian/foreigner ₹5/50, camera/video ₹30/100; h10am-1pm & 2-5.30pm Sat-Thu), dates from 1624 and contains an interesting little museum. Other notable buildings include New Jerusalem Church (Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church; King's St), an intriguing mix of Indian and European styles built in 1718, and the 14th-century seafront Masilamani Nathar Temple , now in kaleidoscopic colours.
All accommodation is run by the Bungalow on the Beach (%04364-288065;

There are 17 beautiful old-world rooms spread across the main building and two other heritage locations in town, plus five simple, clean budget rooms in the Hotel Tamil Nadu, opposite the main building; you get wonderfultemple views from budget room 5, and all rooms are air-conditioned. The main building has a fantastic swimming pool and a good multicuisine restaurant (mains ₹150-300; h7.30-9.30am, 12.30-2.30pm, 7-9.30pm). Booking ahead is strongly recommended.
Buses in this region get incredibly crowded, but Tranquebar has regular connections with Chidambaram (₹30, two hours, hourly) and Karaikal (₹11, 30 minutes, half-hourly). From Karaikal buses go to Kumbakonam (₹36, 2¼ hours, half-hourly 4.15am to 10.15pm), Thanjavur (₹64, 3½ hours, hourly 4.15am to 10.15pm) and Puducherry (Pondicherry;
₹85, four hours, half-hourly 4.15am to midnight).
Kumbakonam
%0435 / Pop 140,156
At first glance Kumbakonam is just another Indian junction town, but then you notice the dozens of colourful gopurams pointing skyward from its 18 temples, a reminder that this was once a seat of medieval South Indian power. And with another two magnificent World Heritage–listed Chola temples nearby, it's worth staying the night.

CHOLA TEMPLES NEAR KUMBAKONAM
Two of the three great monuments of Chola civilisation stand in villages near Kumbakonam: the Airavatesvara Temple in Darasuram and the Gangaikondacholapuram temple. Unlike the also World Heritage–listed Brihadishwara Temple at Thanjavur (Tanjore), today these temples receive relatively few worshippers (and visitors). They are wonderful both for their overall form (with pyramidal towers rising at the heart of rectangular walled compounds) and for the exquisite detail of their carved stone.
From Kumbakonam, frequent buses heading to nearby villages will drop you at Darasuram; buses to Gangaikondacholapuram (₹21, 1½ hours) run every half-hour. A return autorickshaw to Darasuram costs about ₹150. A half-day car trip to both temples, through Hotel Raya's, is ₹1100 (₹1250 with AC).
Airavatesvara Temple
(h6am-8pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
Only 3km west of Kumbakonam in Darasuram, this temple dedicated to Shiva was constructed by Rajaraja II (1146–63). The steps of the Rajagambhira Hall are carved with vivid elephants and horses pulling chariots. This pavilion's 108 all-different pillars have detailed carvings including dancers, acrobats and the five-in-one beast Yali (elephant's head, lion's body, goat's horns, pig's ears and a cow's backside). Inside the main shrine (h6am-noon & 4-8pm), you can honour the central lingam and get a tilak (forehead mark) for ₹10.
On the outside of the shrine are several fine carved images of Shiva. Four mandapas (pillared pavilions) frame the corners of the courtyard complex.
Gangaikondacholapuram Temple
(h6am-noon & 4-8pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
The temple at Gangaikondacholapuram ('City of the Chola who Conquered the Ganges'), 35km north of Kumbakonam, is dedicated to Shiva. It was built byRajendra I in the 11th century when he moved the Chola capital here from Thanjavur, and has many similarities to the earlier Brihadishwara at Thanjavur. Its beautiful 49m-tall tower, however, has a slightly concave curve, making it the 'feminine' counterpart to the mildly convex Thanjavur one. The complex's artistic highlights are the wonderfully graceful sculptures around the tower's exterior.
A massive Nandi (Shiva's vehicle) faces the temple from the surrounding gardens. The main shrine, beneath the tower, contains a huge lingam and is approached through a long, gloomy 17th-century hall. The fine carvings on the tower's exterior include Shiva as the beggar Bhikshatana, immediately left of the southern steps; Ardhanarishvara (Shiva as half-man, half-woman) and Shiva as Nataraja, on the south side; and Shiva with Ganga, Shiva emerging from the lingam, and Vishnu with Lakshmi and Bhudevi (the first three images on the west side). Most famous of all is the striking panel of Shiva garlanding the head of his follower, Chandesvara, beside the northern steps.
Thanjavur (Tanjore)
%04362 / Pop 222,943
Here are the ochre foundation blocks of perhaps the most remarkable civilisation of Dravidian history, one of the few kingdoms to expand Hinduism beyond India, a bedrock for aesthetic styles that spread from Madurai to the Mekong. A dizzying historical legacy was forged from Thanjavur, capital of the great Chola empire during its heyday. Today, this is a crowded, hectic, modern Indian town but the past is still very much present. Every day thousands of people worship at the Cholas' grand Brihadishwara Temple, and Thanjavur's labyrinthine royal palace preserves memories of other powerful dynasties from later centuries.Thanjavur (Tanjore)

 ; h6am-8.30pm)
Come here twice: in the morning, when the tawny granite begins to assert its dominance over the white dawn sunshine, and in the evening, when the rocks capture a hot palette of reds, oranges, yellows and pinks on the crowning glory of Chola temple architecture. The World Heritage–listed Brihadishwara Temple was built between 1003 and 1010 by Rajaraja I (‘king of kings’). The outer fortifications were put up by Thanjavur's later Nayak and British regimes.
You enter through a Nayak gate, followed by two original gopurams with elaborate stucco sculptures. You might find the temple elephant under one of the gopurams, dispensing good luck with a dab of his trunk to anyone who puts a rupee in it. Several shrines are dotted around the extensive grassy areas of the walled temple compound, including one of India’s largest statues of Nandi(Shiva’s sacred bull) facing the main temple building. Cut from a single rock, this 16th-century Nayak creation is 6m long.
A long, columned assembly hall leads to the central shrine (h8.30am-12.30pm & 4-8.30pm) with its 4m-high Shiva lingam, beneath the superb 61m-high vimana (tower). The assembly hall's southern steps are flanked by two huge dvarapalas (temple guardians). Many lovely, graceful deity images stand in niches around the vimana's lower levels, including Shiva emerging from the lingam (beside the southern steps); Shiva as the beggar Bhikshatana (first image, south side); Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu) on the west wall; and Ardhanarishvara (Shiva as half-man, half-woman), leaning on Nandi, on the north side. Between the deity images are panels showing classical dance poses.
The compound also contains a helpful interpretation centre along the south wall and, in the colonnade along the west and north walls, hundreds more linga. Both west and north walls are lined with exquisite lime-plaster Chola frescoes, for years buried under later Nayak-era murals. North of the temple compound, but still within the outer fortifications, are a park (admission ₹5) containing the

PALACE

 ).
 ; Indian/foreigner ₹30/150, camera ₹50/100; h9am-6pm)
Thanjavur’s royal palace is a mixed bag of ruin and renovation, superb art and random royal paraphernalia. The mazelike complex was constructed partly by the Nayaks who took over Thanjavur in 1535, and partly by a local Maratha dynasty that ruled from 1676 to 1855. The two don't-miss sections are the Saraswati Mahal Library Museum and the Art Gallery.
Seven different sections of the palace can be visited – and you'll need three different tickets to see them all. The Art Gallery and Saraswati Mahal Library Museum are included in the ‘full’ ticket, along with the Mahratta Dharbar Hall, the bell tower, and the Saarjah Madi. The main entrance is from the north, via a lane off East Main St. On the way in you’ll come to the main ticket office, followed by the Maratha Palace complex.
Past the ticket office, a passage to the left leads to, first, the Royal PalaceMuseum, a small miscellany of sculptures, weaponry, elephant bells and rajas’ headgears; second, the Maharaja Serfoji Memorial Hall, commemorating the enlightened Maratha scholar-king Serfoji II (1798–1832), with a better collection overlooking a once-splendid, now crumbling courtyard; and third, the Mahratta Dharbar Hall, where Maratha rulers gave audience in a grand but faded pavilion adorned with colourful murals, including their own portraits behind the dais.
As you exit the passage, the fabulous little Sarawasti Mahal Library Museum is on your left. Perhaps Serfoji II’s greatest contribution to posterity, this is testimony both to the 19th-century obsession with knowledge accumulation and to an eclectic mind that collected prints of Chinese torture methods, Audubon-style paintings of Indian flora and fauna, world atlases and rare medieval books. Serfoji amassed more than 65,000 books and 50,000 palm- leaf paper manuscripts in Indian and European languages, though most aren’t displayed.
Leaving the library, turn left for the Art Gallery, set around the Nayak Palace courtyard. This contains a collection of superb, mainly Chola, bronzes and stone carvings, and one of its rooms, the 1600 Nayak Durbar Hall, has a statue of Serfoji II. From the courtyard, steps lead part of the way up a large gopuram-like tower to a whale skeleton said to have been washed up in Tranquebar.
The renovated Saarjah Madi is best admired from East Main St for its ornate balconies.

Trichy (Tiruchirappalli)%0431 / Pop 847,387
Welcome to (more or less) the geographic centre of Tamil Nadu. Tiruchirappalli, universally known as Trichy or Tiruchi, isn’t just a travel junction; it also mixes up a heaving bazaar with some major must-see temples. It's a huge, crowded, busy city, and the fact that most hotels are clumped together around the big bus station isn't exactly a plus point. But Trichy has a strong character and long history, and a sneaky way of overturning first impressions.
Trichy may have been a capital of the early Cholas in the 3rd century BC. It passed through the hands of the Pallavas, medieval Cholas, Pandyas, Delhi Sultanate and Vijayanagars before the Madurai Nayaks brought it to prominence, making it a capital in the 17th century and building its famous Rock Fort Temple.
Trichy stretches a long way from north to south, and most of what's interesting to travellers is split into three distinct areas. The Trichy Junction, or Cantonment, area in the south has most of the hotels and restaurants and the main bus and train stations. The Rock Fort Temple and main bazaar are 4km north of here; the other important temples are in Srirangam, a further 4km north, across the Cauvery River. Luckily, the whole lot is connected by a good bus service.Trichy (Tiruchirappalli)

o Rock Fort Temple
HINDU TEMPLE
( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ; admission ₹3, camera/video ₹20/100; h6am-8pm)
The Rock Fort Temple, perched 83m high on a massive outcrop, lords over Trichy with stony arrogance. The ancient rock was first hewn by the Pallavas and Pandyas, who cut small cave temples on its south side, but it was the war- savvy Nayaks who later made strategic use of the naturally fortified position. There are over 400 stone-cut steps to climb to the top.
From NSB Rd on the south side, you pass between small shops and cross a street before entering the temple precinct itself. Then it's 180 steps up to the Thayumanaswamy Temple, the rock's biggest temple, on the left (closed to non-Hindus). A gold-topped tower rises over its sanctum, which houses a 2m-high Shiva lingam. Further up, you pass the 6th-century Pallava cave temple on the left – it's usually railed off but if you get inside, note the famous Gangadhara panel on the left, showing Shiva restraining the waters of the Ganges with a single strand of his hair. From here it's just another 183 steps to the small Uchipillaiyar Temple at the summit, dedicated to Ganesh. The view is wonderful, with eagles wheeling beneath and Trichy sprawling all around. Back at the bottom, check out the lower rock-cut cave temple, with particularly fine pillars (right past five or six houses as you exit the temple precinct, then right again down a small lane).
The stone steps get scorchingly hot in the midday sun and it's a barefoot climb, so time your visit carefully.

HINDU TEMPLE

 ; camera/video ₹50/100; h6am-9pm)
All right temple-philes, here’s the one you’ve been waiting for: quite possibly the biggest temple in India – so large, it feels like a self-enclosed city. It has 49 separate shrines, all dedicated to Vishnu, and reaching the inner sanctum from the south, as most worshippers do, requires passing through seven gopurams.
The first, the Rajagopuram ( 
MAP
 
GOOGLE MAP
 ), was added in 1987, and is
one of Asia's tallest temple towers at 73m high.
You pass through streets with shops, restaurants, motorbikes and cars until you reach the temple proper at the fourth gopuram. Inside is the ticket desk for the nearby roof viewpoint (ticket ₹10; h6am-5pm), which gives semi-panoramic views of the complex. Take no notice of would-be guides who spin all kinds of stories to get you to hire them. Non-Hindus cannot pass the sixth gopuram so won't see the innermost sanctum whose image shows Vishnu as Lord Ranganatha, reclining on a five-headed snake.
Turn right just before the fifth gopuram to the small but intriguing Art
Museum (admission ₹5; h9am-1pm & 2-6pm), with good bronzes, tusks of bygone
temple elephants, and a collection of superb 17th-century Nayak ivory figurines depicting gods, demons, and kings and queens (some erotically engaged). Continue round to the left past the museum to the Sesha Mandapa, a 16th-century pillared hall with magnificently detailed Vijayanagar carvings of rearing horses in battle. Inside the fifth gopuram is the Garuda Mandapa, with a shrine to Vishnu's man-eagle vehicle.
The temple's most important festival is the 21-day Vaikunta Ekadasi (Paradise Festival) in December/January, when the celebrated Vaishnavaite text, Tiruvaimozhi, is recited before an image of Vishnu.
Bus 1 from or to the Central Bus Station or the Rock Fort stops just south of the Rajagopuram.

If you’re visiting Tamil Nadu's five elemental temples of Shiva, you need to see Sri Jambukeshwara, dedicated to Shiva, Parvati and the medium of water. The liquid theme is realised in the central shrine (closed to non-Hindus), whose Shiva lingam reputedly issues a nonstop trickle of water. If you’re taking bus 1, ask for ‘Tiruvanakoil’; the temple is 350m east of the main road.

SOUTHERN TAMIL NADU
Chettinadu
The Chettiars, a community of traders based in and around Karaikkudi, 95km south of Trichy, hit the big time back in the 19th century as financiers and entrepreneurs in colonial-era Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. They lavished their fortunes on building at least 10,000, maybe even 30,000 opulent mansions in the 75 towns and villages of their arid rural homeland, Chettinadu. No expense was spared on finding the finest materials for these palatial homes – Burmese teak, Italian marble, Indian rosewood, English steel, and art and sculpture from everywhere. In the aftermath of WWII, the Chettiars' business networks came crashing down and many families left Chettinadu. Disused mansions fell into decay and were demolished or sold off piecemeal. Awareness of their value started to revive around the turn of the 21st century, with Chettinadu making it onto Unesco's tentative World Heritage list in 2014. Several mansions have now been turned into gorgeous heritage hotels where you can enjoy authentic Chettinad cuisine, known throughout India for its brilliant use of spices.
1 Sights & Activities Hotels give cooking demos or classes, and provide bicycles or bullock carts for rural rambles. They can also arrange visits to sari-weavers, temples, private mansions, the Athangudi tileworkers (producing the colourful handmade tiles in most Chettiar mansions), and shrines of the popular pre-Hindu deity Ayyanar (identifiable by their large terracotta horses, Ayyanar's vehicle). The antique shops in Karaikkudi's Muneeswaran Koil St give you an idea of how much of theChettiar heritage is still being flogged.
The nondescript town of Pudukkottai, 51km south of Trichy and 44km north of Karaikkudi, has historical significance in inverse proportion to its current obscurity: it was the capital of the only princely state in Tamil Nadu to remain officially independent throughout British rule.
Vijayalaya Cholisvaram
(Narthamalai)
HINDU TEMPLE
This small but stunning 8th-century temple stands on a dramatically deserted rock slope 1km southwest of Narthamalai village, about 16km north of Pudukkottai. Reminiscent of the Shore Temple at Mamallapuram, without the crowds, it was probably built in late Pallava times. The caretaker, if present, will open two rock-cut Shiva shrines in the rock face behind, one with 12 impressively large reliefs of Vishnu.
The Narthamalai turnoff is 7km south of Keeranur on the Trichy–Pudukkottai road; it's 2km west to the village.

8 Getting There & Away Car is by far the best way to get to and around Chettinadu. Renting one with a driver from Trichy, Thanjavur or Madurai for two days costs around ₹5000. Otherwise there are buses about every five minutes from Trichy to Pudukkottai (₹25, 1½ hours) and Karaikkudi (₹85, 2½ hours); you can hop off and on along the way. From Madurai, buses run to Karaikkudi (₹37, two hours) and Pudukkottai (₹57, 2½ hours) every 10 minutes. There are also buses from Thanjavur and Rameswaram.
Madurai
%0452 / Pop 1.02 million
Chennai may be the capital of Tamil Nadu, but Madurai claims its soul. Madurai is Tamil-born and Tamil-rooted, one of the oldest cities in India, a metropolis that traded with ancient Rome and was a great capital long before Chennai was even dreamt of.
Tourists, Indian and foreign, usually come here to see the Meenakshi Amman Temple, a labyrinthine structure ranking among the greatest temples of India. Otherwise, Madurai, perhaps appropriately given her age, captures many of India’s glaring dichotomies, with a centre dominated by a medieval temple and an economy increasingly driven by IT, all overlaid with the energy and excitement of a big Indian city and slotted into a much more manageable package than Chennai’s sprawl.
History Legend has it that Shiva showered drops of nectar(madhuram) from his locks onto the city, giving rise to the name Madurai – 'the City of Nectar'.
Ancient documents record the existence of Madurai from the 3rd century BC. It was a trading town, especially in spices, and according to legend was the home of the third sangam (gathering of Tamil scholars and poets). Over the centuries Madurai came under the sway of the Cholas, Pandyas, local Muslim sultans, Hindu Vijayanagar kings, and the Nayaks, who ruled until 1736 and set out the old city in a lotus shape. Under Tirumalai Nayak (1623–59) the bulk of the Meenakshi Amman Temple was built, and Madurai became the hub of Tamil culture, playing an important role in the development of the Tamil language.
In 1840 the British East India Company razed Madurai's fort and filled in its moat. The four broad Veli streets were constructed on top and to this day define the old city's limits.Madurai

HINDU TEMPLE

 ; Indian/foreigner ₹5/50, phone camera ₹50; h4am-12.30pm & 4-9.30pm)
The abode of the triple-breasted warrior goddess Meenakshi (‘fish-eyed’ – an epithet for perfect eyes in classical Tamil poetry) is considered by many to be the height of South Indian temple architecture, as vital to the aesthetic heritage of this region as the Taj Mahal is to North India. It’s not so much a 17th-century temple as a 6-hectare complex with 12 tall gopurams, encrusted with a staggering array of gods, goddesses, demons and heroes (1511 of them on the south gopuram alone).
According to legend, the beautiful Meenakshi (a version of Parvati) was born with three breasts and this prophecy: her superfluous breast would melt away when she met her husband. The event came to pass when she met Shiva and took her place as his consort. The existing temple was built during the 17th-century reign of Tirumalai Nayak, but its origins go back 2000 years to when Madurai was a Pandyan capital.
The four streets surrounding the temple are pedestrian-only. Dress codes and security are strict for the temple itself: no women's shoulders, or legs of either gender, may be exposed, and no cameras are allowed inside (but you can use phone cameras). Despite this the temple has a happier, more joyful atmosphere than some of Tamil Nadu's more solemn shrines, and is adorned with especially colourful ceiling and wall paintings. Every evening at 9pm, a frenetic, incense- clouded procession carries an icon of Sundareswarar (Shiva) to Meenakshi's shrine to spend the night; visitors are welcome to follow along.
Before entering the temple, have a look around the Pudhu Mandapa. The main temple entrance is through the eastern (oldest) gopuram. First, on the right,
you'll come to the Thousand Pillared Hall, now housing an Art Museum. Moving on into the temple, you'll reach a Nandi shrine surrounded by more beautifully carved columns. Ahead is the main Shiva shrine, flanked on each side by massive dvarapalas, and further ahead to the left in a separate enclosure is the main Meenakshi shrine, both open only to Hindus. Anyone, however, can wander round the Golden Lotus Tank, then leave the temple via a hall of flowersellers and the arch-ceilinged Ashta Shakti Mandapa – this is actually used as the temple entrance by most worshippers and is lined with relief carvings of the goddess's eight attributes, with perhaps the loveliest of all the temple's vibrantly painted ceilings.

This 16th-century pillared hall stands outside the temple, opposite the eastern gopuram. It's filled with colourful textile and crafts stalls and tailors at sewing machines, partly hiding some of the lovely pillar sculptures, but it's easy to find the triple-breasted Meenakshi near the southeast corner, facing Sundareswarar (opposite), and their marriage, accompanied by Vishnu, just inside the western entrance. A particularly handsome light-blue Nandi (Shiva's vehicle) sits outside the eastern entrance of the mandapa.

Although it’s said to be only a quarter of its original size, its massive scale and hybrid Dravidian-Islamic style still testify to the lofty aspirations of its creator. You enter from the east – a large courtyard surrounded by tall columns topped with fancy stucco work leads through to the grand throne chamber with its 25m-high dome; two stone-carved horses frame the steps up.

Teppam (Float) Festival
(hJan/Feb)
RELIGIOUS
A popular event held on the full moon of the Tamil month of Thai, when Meenakshi temple deities are paraded around town in elaborate procession and floated in a brightly lit 'mini-temple' on the huge Mariamman Teppakkulam tank, 3km east of the old city.
The evening culminates in Shiva’s seduction of his wife, whereupon the icons are brought back to the temple to make love and, in so doing, regenerate the universe. Meenakshi’s diamond nose stud is removed so it doesn’t irritate her lover. Due to low rainfall, the 2013 and 2014 celebrations were 'dry' floats.
Chithirai Festival

The highlight of Madurai’s busy festival calendar is this two-week event celebrating the marriage of Meenakshi to Sundareswarar (Shiva). The deities are wheeled around the Meenakshi Amman Temple in massive chariots forming part of long, colourful processions.

7 Shopping Madurai teems with cloth stalls and tailors’ shops, as you might notice upon being approached by tailor touts. A great place for getting clothes made up is the Pudhu Mandapa. Here you’ll find rows of tailors busily treadling away and capable of whipping up a good replicaof whatever you’re wearing in an hour or two. A cotton top or shirt can cost ₹350. Drivers, guides and touts will also be keen to lead you to the Kashmiri craft shops in North Chitrai St, offering to show you the temple view from the rooftop – the views are good, and so is the inevitable sales pitch.

Rameswaram
%04573 / Pop 44,856
Rameswaram was once the southernmost point of sacred India; to leave its boundaries was to abandon caste and fall below the status of the lowliest skinner of sacred cows. Then Rama, incarnation of Vishnu and hero of the Ramayana, led an army of monkeys and bears across a monkey-built bridge to the island of (Sri) Lanka, where he defeated the demon Ravana and rescued his wife, Sita. Afterwards, prince and princess came to this spot to offer thanks to Shiva.
If all this seems like so much folklore, it’s absolute truth for millions of Hindus, who flock to the Ramanathaswamy Temple to worship where a god worshipped a god.
Apart from these pilgrims, Rameswaram is a small fishing town on a conch- shaped island, Pamban, connected to the mainland by 2km-long road and rail bridges. The town smells of drying fish and, if you aren't a pilgrim, the temple alone barely merits the journey here. But the eastern point of the island, Dhanushkodi, only 30km from Sri Lanka, has a natural magic and beauty that add considerably to Rameswaram's appeal.
Most hotels and eateries are clustered around the Ramanathaswamy Temple, which is surrounded by North, East, South and West Car Sts. Middle St heads west towards the bus stand (around 2km). The train station is 1.5km southwest of the temple.1 Sights
Ramanathaswamy Temple
(h5am-1pm & 3-8pm)
HINDU TEMPLE
Housing the world’s most sacred sand mound (a lingam said to have been created by Rama's wife Sita, so that he could worship Shiva), this temple is one of India's holiest shrines. Dating mainly from the 16th to 18th centuries, it's notable for its long, exquisite 1000-pillar halls and 22 theerthams (temple tanks), in which pilgrims bathe before visiting the deity. Attendants tip pails of water over the (often fully dressed) faithful, who then rush on to the next theertham.
The legend goes that, when Rama decided to worship Shiva, he figured he’d need a lingam to do the thing properly. Being a god, he sent Hanuman to find the biggest lingam around – a Himalayan mountain. But the monkey took too long, so Sita made the simple lingam of sand now enshrined in the temple's inner sanctum.
Cameras and phones are forbidden inside the temple. Only Hindus may enter the inner shrine.
WORTH A TRIP
DHANUSHKODI
The promontory stretches 22km southeast from Rameswaram, narrowing to a thin strip of sand dunes about halfway along. Near the end stands the ghost town of Dhanushkodi. Once a thriving port, Dhanushkodi was washed away by the tidal waves of a monster cyclone in 1964. The shells of its train station, church, post office and other ruins still stand among a scattering of fishers' shacks, and Adam’s Bridge (or Rama's Bridge), the chain of reefs, sandbanks and islets that almost connects India with Sri Lanka, stretches away to the east. For many, this is the final stop of a long prilgrimage. Go for sunrise, when the atmosphere is at its most magical, with pilgrims performing pujas.
Autorickshaws charge about ₹400 round trip (including waiting time) to Moonram Chattram, a collection of fishers' huts about 14km from town. From there to Dhanushkodi it's a hot 4km beach walk, or a ₹100 two-hour round trip in a truck or minibus which goes when it fills up with 12 to 20 customers (6am to 6pm). Many hotels organise private jeeps to whizz you along to Danushkodi (around ₹1500 return). It’s tempting to swim, but beware of strong rips.4 Sleeping & Eating Most hotels are geared towards pilgrims, and some cheapies (which are mostly pretty grim) refuse to take single travellers, but there’s a string of reasonable midrange hotels. Book ahead before festivals. Budget travellers can try the rooms booking office (East Car St; h24hr), opposite the main, eastern temple entrance, which often scores doubles for as low as ₹300 a night.
Inexpensive vegetarian restaurants such as Vasantha Bhavan (East Car St;
dishes ₹30-50; h7am-10pm) and Ananda Bhavan (West Car St; h6.30am-10.30pm) serve
thali lunches for ₹50 to ₹70, and evening dosas and uttapams for about ₹40. You might find fish in some restaurants, but no real meats.

This is it, the end of India. There’s a sense of accomplishment on making it to the tip of the subcontinent's 'V', past the final dramatic flourish of the Western Ghats and the green fields, glinting rice paddies and slow-looping wind turbines of India's deep south. Like all edges, there's a sense of the surreal here. At certain times of year you can see the sun set and the moon rise over three seas simultaneously. The Temple of the Virgin Sea Goddess, Swami Vivekananda's legacy and the 'Land's End' symbolism draw crowds of pilgrims and tourists to Kanyakumari, but it remains a small-scale, refreshing respite from the hectic Indian road.Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin)

 ; h4.30am-12.15pm & 4-8.15pm)
The legends say the kanya (virgin) goddess Kumari, a manifestation of the Great Goddess Devi, single-handedly conquered demons and secured freedom for the world. At this temple at the tip of the subcontinent, pilgrims give her thanks in an intimately spaced, beautifully decorated temple, where the crash of waves from three seas can be heard behind the twilight glow of oil fires clutched in vulva-shaped votive candles (referencing the sacred femininity of the goddess).
It's believed that the sea-facing door of the temple stays locked to prevent the shimmer of the goddess's diamond nose-stud leading ships astray. You'll probably be asked for a ₹10 donation to enter the inner precinct, where men must remove their shirts, and cameras are forbidden.
The shoreline around the temple has a couple of tiny beaches, and bathing
ghats (

before visiting the temple. The mandapa south of the temple is popular for sunset-watching and daytime shade. A small souvenir-shop bazaar leads back from here to the main road.

Four hundred metres offshore is the rock where the famous Hindu apostle Swami Vivekananda meditated from 25 to 27 December 1892, and decided totake his moral message beyond India’s shores. A two-mandapa memorial to Vivekananda, built in 1970, reflects temple architectural styles from across India. With all the tourist crowds this brings, Vivekananda would no doubt choose somewhere else to meditate today. Ferries shuttle out to the Vivekananda island (₹34 return) between 7.45am and 4pm.

Looking like an Indian Colossus of Rhodes, the towering statue on the smaller island next to the Vivekananda Memorial is of the ancient Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar. The work of more than 5000 sculptors, it was erected in 2000 and honours the poet’s 133-chapter work Thirukural – hence its height of exactly 133ft (40.5m). Vivekananda rock ferries (₹34 return) usually continue to Thiruvalluvar between 2pm and 4pm.

With a forest’s worth of intricately carved rosewood ceilings and polished-teak beams, this palace, 35km northwest of Kanyakumari near the Kerala border, is considered the finest example of traditional Keralan architecture today. Asia’s largest wooden palace complex, it was once the capital of Travancore, an unstable princely state taking in parts of both Tamil Nadu and Kerala. As the egos of successive rulers left their mark, it expanded into the magnificent conglomeration of 14 palaces it is today; the oldest sections date back to 1550.
Direct buses leave from Kanyakumari bus stand at 7.15am, 11am, 1pm, 1.30pm and
4.45pm (₹21, two hours); buses also run every 10 minutes between 4.30am and 10pm to Thuckalay, from where it’s a short autorickshaw ride or 15-minute walk. Taxis between Kanyakumari and Kovalam (Kerala), stopping at Padmanabhapuram, cost ₹3000.
From Trivandrum (Thiruvananthapuram) take any bus towards Kanyakumari and get off at Thuckalay (₹50, 1½ hours, eight daily). The Kerala Tourist Development Corporation runs full-day Kanyakumari tours from Trivandrum (₹700) covering Padmanabhapuram.
THE WESTERN GHATS
Welcome to the lush Western Ghats, some of the most welcome heat relief in India. Rising like an impassable bulwark of evergreen and deciduous tangle from north of Mumbai to the tip of Tamil Nadu, the World Heritage-listed Ghats (with an average elevation of 915m) contain 27% of India’s flowering plants and an incredible array of endemic wildlife. In Tamil Nadu they rise to 2000m and more in the Palani Hills around Kodaikanal and the Nilgiris around Ooty. British influence lingers a little stronger up in these hills, where the colonists built their
'hill stations' to escape the sweltering plains and covered slopes in neatly trimmed tea bushes. It’s not just the air and (relative) lack of pollution that’s refreshing – there’s a certain acceptance of quirkiness and eccentricity here that is rarer in the lowlands. Think organic farms, handlebar-moustached trekking guides and leopard-print earmuffs.

heat-soaked plains and disembarking in the sharp pinch of a Kodaikanal night or morning. This misty hill station, 120km northwest of Madurai in the Palani Hills, is more relaxed and intimate than its big sister Ooty (Kodai is the ‘Princess of Hill Stations’, while Ooty is the 'Queen'). It’s not all cold either; during the day the weather can be more like deep spring than early winter. The renowned Kodaikanal International School provides a bit of cosmopolitan flair, with students from around the globe.
Centred on a beautiful lake, Kodai rambles up and down hillsides with patches of shola (virgin forest), unique to the Western Ghats in South India, and evergreen broadleaf trees such as magnolia, mahogany, myrtle and rhododendron. Another of its plant specialities is the kurinji shrub, whose lilac- blue blossoms appear only every 12 years: next due 2018.
Kodai is popular with honeymooners and groups, who flock to the spectacular viewoints and waterfalls in and around town.Kodaikanal (Kodai)

 ; Sacred Heart College, Law’s Ghat Rd; adult/child ₹15/10, camera ₹20; h9am-6pm)
In the grounds of a former Jesuit seminary 4km downhill east of town, this museum has a ghoulishly intriguing miscellany of flora and fauna put together over more than 100 years by priests and trainees. Displays range over bottled snakes, human embryos (!), giant moths and stuffed animal carcasses. You can also see pressed kurinji flowers (Strobilanthes kunthiana) in case you aren't around for their flowering.

6pm), landscaped and stocked by the British officer after whom it’s named, is pretty, and usually busy with both tourists and canoodling couples.
Several natural-beauty spots around Kodai (crowded with souvenir and snack stalls) are very popular with Indian tourists. They're best visited by taxi unless you like strolling along busy roads. Taxi drivers offer three-hour 12-stop tours for around ₹1200. On clear days, Green Valley View (6km from the centre), Pillar Rocks (7km) and less visited Moir's Point (13km), all along the same road west of town, have spectacular views to the plains far below.
To go beyond Moir's Point to forest-fringed Berijam Lake (hclosed Tues)requires a ₹150 Forest Department permit. Taxi drivers can organise this, often the same day, and do four-hour 'forest tours' to Berijam for ₹1800.
The river that empties Kodaikanal Lake tumbles dramatically down Silver Cascade , on the Madurai road 7km from town. Compact Bear Shola Falls are in a pocket of forest on the northwest edge of town.
Walking
Assuming it’s not cloaked in opaque mist, the views from paved Coaker’s

 ; admission ₹10; h7.30am-7pm) are beautiful, all the way
down to the plains 2000m below. The stroll takes five minutes.
The 5km Kodaikanal Lake circuit is lovely in the early morning before the crowds roll in. A walk along Lower Shola Rd takes you through the Bombay Shola, the nearest surviving patch of shola to central Kodai.
Most serious trekking routes around Kodai require Forest Department permits which can only be obtained with time, patience and luck. Contact Kodai's

guesthouses such as Greenlands Youth Hostel will put you in touch with local guides, including the very experienced Vijay Kumar (%9965524279; thenaturetrails@gmail.com), who can help with permits and offer interesting off-road routes (₹500 to ₹800 per half-day).
A good trek, if you can organise it, is the two-day Kodai–Munnar route into Kerala via Bodi and Top Station (though it involves some bus/rickshaw transport). Guides charge ₹4000 to ₹5000 per person.
WORTH A TRIP
VATTAKANAL WALK
This is a lovely walk of about 4.5km (each way) from central Kodai, on which you might spot gaur (bison) or giant squirrels in the forested bits. From the south end of Coaker's Walk, follow St Mary's Rd west then southwest, passing La Saleth Church after 1.2km. At a fork 400m after the church, go left downhill on what quickly becomes an unpaved track passing through the Pambar shola (virgin forest). After 450m you emerge on a bridge above some falls. Across the bridge you'll find snack stalls selling fruit, tea, coffee, bread,omelettes, and roasted corn with lime and masala. Follow the road 1km downhill, with panoramas opening up as you go, to Vattakanal village. Take the steep path down past Altaf's Cafe and in about 15 minutes you'll reach the Dolphin's Nose, a narrow rock lookout overhanging a precipitous drop, and a couple more snack stalls.
Boating, Cycling & Horse Riding If you’re sappy in love like a bad Bollywood song, the thing to do in Kodai is rent a pedal boat (₹60 per half-hour for two people), rowboat (₹90 including boatman) or Kashmiri shikara (‘honeymoon boat’; ₹350 including boatman) from
the Kodaikanal Boat & Rowing Club (

Bicycle rental (₹20/300 per hour/day) and horse riding (₹50/1000 per
500m/two hours) stands are dotted around the lake.

Vattakanal
Little Vattakanal village ('Vatta'), about 4.5km southwest of Kodai centre, is a great rural retreat for budget travellers.

8 Getting There & Away The nearest train station is Kodai Road, down in the plains about 80km east of Kodaikanal. There are eight daily trains to/from Chennai Egmore including the overnight Pandyan Express (sleeper/3AC/2AC/1AC ₹295/760/1065/1800, eight hours), departing Chennai at 9.20pm and departing Kodai Road northbound at 9.10pm. For most closer destinations, it's quicker and easier to get a bus. Taxis to/from the station cost ₹1200. Direct buses from Kodaikanal to Kodai Road leave daily at 3pm and 4pm (₹55, three hours); there are also plenty of buses between the station and Batlagundu, on the Kodai–Madurai bus route. Kodai's
post office has a train booking desk ( 
Post Office Rd; h9am-2pm & 3-4pm Mon-Sat ).

FARMSTAY
Deep in the valley 22km from Kodaikanal, off the Kodai–Palani road, this ecofriendly French-run retreat sprawls across 49 hectares of mountain jungle and organic farm. Elephants, peacocks and bison wander through regularly, and comfy local-material cottages, including a treehouse, sit either side of a river. The French-Indian restaurant does wonderful meals packed with garden-fresh veg, and home-grown coffee. Wildlife spotting peaks April to July.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
ANAMALAI TIGER RESERVE
A pristine 850-sq-km reserve of tropical jungle, shola (virgin forest) and grassland rising to 2400m and spilling over into Kerala in the Western Ghats between Kodaikanal and Coimbatore, Anamalai Tiger Reserve (Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary & National Park; admission ₹20, camera/video ₹50/200; hJun-Feb) is well off most tourists’ radar. Declared a tiger reserve in 2007, it’s home to all kinds of exotic endemic wildlife, much of it rare and endangered – including leopards and a few elusive tigers, though you'll probably mostly spot lion-tailed macaques, peacocks, langurs, spotted deer, elephants – or crocodiles at Amaravathi Crocodile Farm.
The reserve’s Reception and Interpretation Centre (%04253-245002; Topslip; h6.30am- 3.30pm) is at Topslip, 35km southwest of Pollachi. From here you can head off on elephant rides (per hour ₹800-1500), official one-hour minibus jungle ‘safaris’ (per personfrom ₹120) or guided treks (per 2 hours ₹2000). Most people visit on day trips, but for those staying the night Topslip has Forest Department accommodation (r ₹500-2500) of varying comfort levels. Book several days ahead through the District Forest Office (%04259-225356, 04259-238360; 365/1 Meenkarai Rd, Pollachi; h10am-5.45pm Mon-Fri) in Pollachi; phone reservations are accepted.
The tiny tea-plantation town of Valparai, on the fringes of the reserve 65km south from Pollachi and reached via a spectacular 40-hairpin-bend road, makes a beautifully peaceful Anamalai base where you’re just as likely to see wildlife. Our pick of the accommodation is Sinna Dorai's Bungalow (%9443077516; www.sinnadorai.com; Valparai; r incl full-board ₹7500; W). Exquisitely located on a rambling tea estate, Sinna Dorai has just six huge rooms bursting with local early 20th-century history. A cosy library, wonderful homemade meals and charming service make you feel right at home. After-dark wildlife- spotting drives, on which you may well find elephants, bison, lion-tailed macaques, and leopards, run regularly, and experienced trekkers will lead you along local paths. It's well signposted from central Valparai.
Several daily buses connect Pollachi with Topslip (₹40, 1½ hours) and Valparai (₹42, three hours). Buses to Pollachi run from Coimbatore’s Ukkadam bus station, which also has four daily services to Valparai (₹65, four hours). From Kodaikanal, buses head to Pollachi (₹100, six hours) at 8.30am and 4.30pm.

This big business and junction city – Tamil Nadu's second largest, often known as the Manchester of India for its textile industry – is friendly enough and increasingly cosmopolitan, but the lack of interesting sights means that for most travellers it's just a stepping stone towards Ooty or Kerala.

Smaller and quieter than Ooty, it has some fantastic heritage hotels and guesthouses, from which you can do exactly the same kind of things as you would do from bigger, busier Ooty. From upper Coonoor, 1km to 2km above the town centre, you can look down over the sea of red-tile rooftops to the slopes beyond and soak up the peace, cool climate and beautiful scenery. But you get none of the above in central Coonoor, which is a bustling, honking mess.

PARK
Upper Coonoor's 12-hectare Sim’s Park, established in 1874, is a peaceful oasis of sloping manicured lawns with more than 1000 plant species from several continents, including magnolias, tree ferns, roses and camellias. Kotagiri-bound buses will drop you here.
Highfield Tea Estate

TEA ESTATE
This 50-year-old estate (2km northeast of upper Coonoor) is one of few Nilgiri working tea factories open to visitors. Self-appointed guides jump in quickly, but you're perfectly welcome to watch the full tea-making process independently.
Dolphin’s Nose
VIEWPOINT
 
About 10km from town, this viewpoint exposes a vast panorama encompassing Catherine Falls across the valley. On the same road, Lamb’s Rock , a favourite picnic spot in a pretty patch of forest, has amazing views past tea and coffeeplantations to the hazy plains. The easiest way to see these sights is a rickshaw tour for around ₹600. If you like, walk the 6km or so back into town from Lamb’s Rock (mostly downhill).
4 Sleeping & Eating You’ll need a rickshaw, car or great legs to reach these places.

8 Getting There & Away Coonoor is on the miniature train line between Mettupalayam (27km) and Ooty (19km), with three daily trains just to/from Ooty as well as the daily Mettupalayam–Ooty– Mettupalayam service. Buses to and from Ooty (₹10, one hour) run every 10 minutes; buses to Kotagiri (₹11, one hour) and Coimbatore (₹45, 2½ hours) go every 20 minutes.
THE NILGIRIS & THEIR TRIBESThe forest-clothed, waterfall-threaded walls of the Nilgiris (Blue Mountains) rise abruptly from the surrounding plains between the lowland towns of Mettupalayam (to the southeast) and Gudalur (to the northwest), ascended only by winding ghat roads and the famous Nilgiri Mountain Railway. The upland territory, a jumble of valleys and hills with over 20 peaks above 2000m, is a botanist's dream, with over 2300 flowering plant species, although a lot of the native shola (virgin forest) and grasslands have been displaced by tea, eucalyptus and cattle.
The Unesco-designated Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve is a larger, 5520-sq-km area that also includes parts of Kerala and Karnataka. One of the world's biodiversity hotspots, it contains several important tiger reserves, national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
The Nilgiris' tribal inhabitants were left pretty much to themselves in their isolated homeland until the British arrived two centuries ago. Today, the effects of colonialism and migration have reduced many tribal cultures to the point of collapse, and some have assimilated to the point of invisibility. Others, however, continue at least a semi- traditional lifestyle. Organisations such as the Keystone Foundation work to promote traditional crafts and activities.
Best known of the tribes, thanks to anthropologists' interest and their proximity to Ooty, are the Toda, who number just over 1000. Some still inhabit tiny villages (munds) of their traditional barrel-shaped huts made of bamboo, cane and grass. Toda women style their hair in long, shoulder-length ringlets, and are skilled embroiderers; both sexes wear distinctive black-and-red-embroidered shawls. Central to Toda life is the water buffalo, which provides milk and ghee for consumption and bartering. Traditionally, it is only at funerals that the strictly vegetarian Toda kill a buffalo, to accompany the deceased.
The 350,000-strong Badaga are thought to have migrated into the Nilgiris from Karnataka around AD 1600, and are thus not usually considered truly indigenous. Their traditional dress is of white cloth with a border of narrow coloured stripes. They worship the mother goddess Hetti Amman, to whom their December/January Hettai Habba festival is dedicated.
The Kota, traditionally cultivators, live in seven settlements in the Kotagiri area. They have adapted relatively well to modernity, with a significant number holding government jobs.
The Kurumba inhabit the thick forests of the south and are gatherers of forest products such as bamboo and wild honey, though many of them now work in agriculture.
Kotagiri
%04266 Pop 28,200 Elev 1800m
The oldest and smallest of the three Nilgiri hill stations, Kotagiri is a quiet, unassuming place with a forgettable town centre – its appeal is the escape to reddirt tracks in the pines, blue skies and the high green walls of the Nilgiris. 1 Sights & Activities You can visit Catherine Falls , 8km south, off the Mettupalayam road (the last 3km is on foot; the falls only flow after rain), Elk Falls (6km) and Kodanad Viewpoint (19km north), where there’s a view over both the Coimbatore Plains and the Mysore Plateau. A half-day taxi tour to all three costs around ₹1000.
Sullivan Memorial

MUSEUM
If you’re interested in the history of the Nilgiris, check out this wonderful little museum, 2km north of Kotagiri centre. The house built in 1819 by John Sullivan, founder of Ooty, has been refurbished and filled with fascinating photos, newspaper cuttings and artefacts about local tribal groups, European settlement and icons such as the toy train. It also contains the Nilgiri Documentation Centre (www.nilgiridocumentation.org), dedicated to preserving the region's beauty and heritage.

La Maison

HERITAGE GUESTHOUSEFlower-draped, French-owned La Maison is a beautifully renovated 1890s Scottish bungalow superbly located on a hilltop surrounded by tea plantations, 5km southwest of Kotagiri. The design is quirky French-chic all the way: antique furniture, tribal handicrafts, old-Ooty paintings. Hike to waterfalls, visit tribal villages, tuck into excellent homecooked meals (₹750), or laze in the valley-facing jacuzzi.
8 Getting There & Away Buses run half-hourly to/from Ooty (₹15, 1½ hours), crossing one of Tamil Nadu’s highest passes, and to Mettupalayam (₹16 to ₹22, 1½ hours). Buses to Coimbatore (₹30, 2½ hours) leave hourly.
Ooty (Udhagamandalam)%0423 Pop 88,430 Elev 2240m
Ooty may be a bit hectic for some tastes, and the town centre is an ugly mess, but it doesn't take long to get up into the quieter, greener areas where tall pines rise above what could almost be English country lanes. Ooty, 'the Queen of Hill Stations', mixes up Indian bustle and Hindu temples with lovely parks and gardens and charming Raj-era bungalows, the latter providing its most atmospheric (and most expensive) places to stay.
The town was established by the British in the early 19th century as the summer headquarters of the Madras government, and memorably nicknamed ‘Snooty Ooty’. Development ploughed through a few decades ago, but somehow old Ooty survives. You just have to walk a bit further out to find it.
The journey up here on the celebrated miniature train is romantic and the scenery stunning. Even the road up from the plains is impressive. From April to June (the very busy 'season') Ooty is a welcome relief from the hot plains, and in the colder months (October to March) you’ll need warm clothing, which you can buy cheap here, as overnight temperatures occasionally drop to 0°C.
The train and bus stations are at the west end of Ooty's racecourse, in almost the lowest part of town. To their west is the lake, while the streets of the town snake upwards all around. From the bus station it’s a 20-minute walk to Ooty’s commercial centre, Charing Cross. Like Kodaikanal, Ooty has an international school whose students can be seen around town.Ooty (Udhagamandalam)

This is it: the highest point (2633m) of the Nilgiris and one of the best viewpoints around, assuming it's a clear day (go early for better chances of mist- free views). It’s about 7km from the town centre. Kotagiri buses will drop you at the Doddabetta junction, then you have a steep-ish 3km walk or a quick jeep ride. Taxis do the round trip from Charing Cross for ₹500.2 Activities
Hiking & Trekking
The best of Ooty is out in the beautiful Nilgiris. Ooty's tourist office and many accommodation places can put you in touch with local guides who do day hikes for ₹400 to ₹600 per person. You'll normally drive out of town and walk around hills, tribal villages and tea plantations.
More serious trekking in the best forest areas with plenty of wildlife – such as beyond Avalanche to the south or Parsons Valley to the west, in Mukurthi National Park, or down to Walakkad and Sairandhri in Kerala's Silent Valley National Park – requires Tamil Nadu Forest Department permits.

Buses also run regularly up and down the mountain from other parts of Tamil Nadu, from Kerala and from Mysuru and Bengaluru in Karnataka. Taxis cluster at several stands around town and there are fixed one-way fares to many destinations, including Coonoor (₹750), Kotagiri (₹850), Coimbatore(₹1700) and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (₹1250).
BUS
For Kochi (Cochin, Kerala) take the 7am or 8am bus to Palakkad (₹95, six
hours) and change there. Royal Tours (

 ; %0423-2446150),
opposite the train station, runs a 9am minibus to Kodaikanal (₹600, eight hours).
The Tamil Nadu and Karnataka state bus companies have reservation offices
at the busy bus station ( 
GOOGLE MAP
 ). Departures include the following:
A Bengaluru (₹391 to ₹650, eight hours, nine daily) A Chennai (₹462, 14 hours, 4.30pm & 5.45pm) A Coimbatore (₹56, four hours, every 30 minutes, 5.30am to 8.40pm) A Mysuru (₹136, five hours, about every 45 minutes,
6.30am to 5.45pm)
TRAIN
The miniature (or 'toy') train from Mettupalayam to Ooty – one of the Mountain Railways of India given World Heritage status by Unesco – is the best way to get here. Called the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, it requires special cog wheels on the locomotive, meshing with a third, 'toothed' rail on the ground, to manage the exceptionally steep gradients. There are wonderful forest, waterfall, mountainside and tea plantation views along the way. The section between Mettupalayam and Coonoor uses steam engines, which push, rather than pull, the train up the hill.
For the high season (April to June), book the train several weeks ahead; at other times a few days ahead is advisable (though not always essential). The train departs Mettupalayam for Ooty at 7.10am daily (1st/2nd class ₹205/30, five hours). From Ooty to Mettupalayam the train leaves at 2pm and takes 3½ hours. Departures and arrivals at Mettupalayam connect with the Nilgiri Express to/from Chennai Central. There are also three daily passenger trains each way just between Ooty and Coonoor (₹25, 1¼ hours).
Ooty is usually listed as Udhagamandalam in train timetables.
8 Getting Around There are autorickshaws and taxis everywhere. Autorickshaw fare charts are posted outside the bus station and botanical gardens and elsewhere. An autorickshaw from the train orbus station to Charing Cross costs about ₹60.
There are jeep taxi stands near the bus station and municipal market: expect to pay about 1.5 times local taxi fares.
Mudumalai Tiger Reserve
%0423
In the foothills of the Nilgiris, this 321-sq-km reserve is like a classical Indian landscape painting given life: thin, spindly trees and light-slotted leaves concealing spotted chital deer and grunting wild boar. Also here are around 50 tigers, giving Mudumalai the highest tiger population density in India – though you'll be very lucky to see one. Overall the reserve is Tamil Nadu's best wildlife- spotting place. The creatures you're most likely to see include deer, peacocks, wild boar, langurs and Malabar giant squirrels. There's also a good chance of sighting wild elephants (the park has several hundred) and gaur (Indian bison).
Along with Karnataka's Bandipur and Nagarhole, Kerala's Wayanad and Tamil Nadu's newly created Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve, Mudumalai forms part of an unbroken chain of protected areas comprising an important wildlife refuge.
Mudumalai sometimes closes for fire risk in April, May or June. Rainy July and August are the least favourable months for visiting.
The reserve's reception centre (%0423-2526235; h6-10am & 2-5.30pm), and
some reserve-run accommodation, is at Theppakadu, on the main road between Ooty and Mysuru. The closest village to Theppakadu is Masinagudi, 7km east.
1 Sights & Activities Hiking in the reserve is not allowed and private vehicles are only permitted on the main Ooty– Gudalur–Theppakadu–Mysore road and the Theppakadu– Masinagudi and Masinagudi–Moyar River roads. Some wildlife can be spotted from these roads, but the best way to see the reserve is on the official 45-minute minibus tours(per person ₹135; hhourly 7-10am & 2-6pm), which make a 15km loop in camouflage-striped 15-or 26-seat buses. Book at the reception centre a couple of hours ahead.
Half-hour elephant rides (up to four people ₹860; h7-8am & 4-5pm Sep-Jun) are also
available from the reception centre; reserve 30 minutes ahead. From 8.30am to 9am and 5.30pm to 6pm you can watch the reserve's working elephants being
fed at the nearby elephant camp (minibus-tour customers free, others ₹15).
Some operators may offer treks in the buffer zone around the reserve, but these are potentially dangerous and the reserve authorities advise very strongly against them; tourists have died from getting too close to wild elephants on illegal treks. Jeep safaris organised through the better resorts, with expert guides, are a safer option.
4 Sleeping & Eating The reserve runs simple lodgings along a track just above the Moyar River at Theppakadu.
Better accommodation is provided by numerous lodges and forest resorts outside the park's fringes, many of them welcoming family-run businesses offering high standards and breathtaking views. Most of the best cluster in Bokkapuram village, 5km from Masinagudi at the foot of the mountains.

Geese waddle around, there's a peaceful grassy pool area with hammocks, meals are good South Indian buffets, and the efficient owners can organise horse riding and private safaris.Jungle Hut
RESORT
(%0423-2526463; www.junglehut.in; Bokkapuram; full-board s ₹4400-6900, d ₹6600-9000; aWs)
Along with ecofriendly touches and a sociable lounge, this welcoming 28-year- old resort has probably the best food in Bokkapuram (if you’re visiting from another resort after dark, don’t walk home alone). Spacious rooms in cottages are scattered around large grounds, where a herd of 200-odd chital deer grazes morning and evening. Jeep safaris, treks and birdwatching can be organised.
8 Getting There & Around A taxi day trip to Mudumalai from Ooty costs around ₹1800. Do go at least one way by the alternative Sighur Ghat road with its spectacular 36-hairpin-bend hill. A one- way taxi from Ooty to Theppakadu should be ₹1250.
Buses between Ooty and Mysuru go via Gudalur and stop at Theppakadu
(₹37, three hours from Ooty). Smaller buses that can handle the Sighur Ghat road run from Ooty to Masinagudi (₹17, 1½ hours, 10 daily). Local buses run several times daily between Masinagudi and Theppakadu (₹5); shared jeeps also ply this route for ₹10 per person if there are enough passengers, or you can have one to yourself for about ₹120. Costs are similar for jeeps between Masinagudi and Bokkapuram.Andaman Islands

Andaman Islands
Why Go?
Long fabled among travellers for its legendary beaches, world-class diving and far-flung location in the middle of nowhere, the Andaman Islands are still the ideal place to get away from it all.
Its lovely opaque emerald waters are surrounded by primeval jungle and mangrove forest, and snow-white beaches that melt under flame-and-purple sunsets  The population is a friendly masala of South and Southeast Asiansunsets. The population is a friendly masala of South and Southeast Asian settlers, as well as Negrito ethnic groups whose arrival here still has anthropologists baffled. Adding to the intrigue is its remote location, some 1370km from the mainland, meaning the islands are geographically more Southeast Asia – 150km from Indonesia and 190km from Myanmar.
While the archipelago comprises some 300 islands, only a dozen or so are open to tourists, Havelock by far being the most popular for its beaches and diving. The Nicobars are strictly off limits to tourists, as are the tribal areas.
When to Go
A Dec–Mar Perfect sunny days, optimal diving conditions and turtle nesting. A Oct–Dec & Mar–mid-May Weather’s a mixed bag, but fewer tourists and lower costs.
A Feb–Aug Pumping waves on Little Andaman for experienced surfers.

History The date of initial human settlement on the Andamans and Nicobars is lost to history. Anthropologists say stone-tool crafters have lived here for 2000 years, and scholars of human migration believe local indigenous tribes have roots in Negrito and Malay ethnic groups in Southeast Asia. Otherwise, these specks in the sea have been a constant source of legend to outside visitors.
The 10th-century Persian adventurer Buzurg Ibn Shahriyar described an island chain inhabited by cannibals, Marco Polo added that the natives had dogs’ heads, and tablets in Thanjavur (Tanjore) in Tamil Nadu named the archipelago Timaittivu: the Impure Islands.
None of the above was exactly tourism-brochure stuff, but visitors kept coming: the Marathas in the late 17th century and, 200 years later, the British, who used the Andamans as a penal colony for political dissidents. In WWII some islanders greeted the invading Japanese as liberators, but despite installing Indian politicians as (puppet) administrators, the Japanese military proved to be harsh occupiers.
Following Independence in 1947, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were incorporated into the Indian Union. With migration from the mainland (including Bengali refugees fleeing the chaos of partition), the population has grown from a few thousand to more than 350,000. During this influx, tribal land rights and environmental protection were often disregarded; while some conditions are improving today, indigenous tribes remain largely in decline.
The islands were devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, offshoreaftershocks and the resulting tsunami. The Nicobars were especially hard hit; some estimate a fifth of the population was killed, others were relocated to Port Blair and many have yet to return. But by and large normalcy has returned.
1 Climate Sea breezes keep temperatures within the 23°C to 31°C range and the humidity at around 80% all year. It’s very wet during the southwest (wet) monsoon between roughly mid-May and early October, while the northeast (dry) monsoons between November and December also have their fair share of rainy days.
1 Geography & Environment Incredibly the islands form the peaks of the Arakan Yoma, a mountain range that begins in Western Myanmar (Burma) and extends into the ocean, running all the way to Sumatra in Indonesia.
The isolation of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has led to the evolution of many endemic plant and animal species. Of 62 identified mammals, 32 are unique to the islands, including the Andaman wild pig, crab-eating macaque, masked palm civet, and species of tree shrews and bats. Of the islands’ 250 bird species, 18 are endemic, including ground-dwelling megapodes, hawabills (swiftlets) and the emerald Nicobar pigeon.
8 Dangers & Annoyances
Crocodiles are a way of life in many parts of the Andamans, particularly Little Andaman, Wandoor, Corbyn's Cove, Baratang and North Andamans. The death of an American tourist who was attacked by a saltwater crocodile while snorkelling in Havelock in 2010 (at Neils Cove near Beach 7) was considered extremely unusual, and remains an isolated incident. There have been no sightings since, but a high level of vigilance remains in place. It’s important you keep informed, heed any warnings by authorities and avoid being in the water at dawn or dusk.
Sandflies are another hindrance, with these small biting insects sometimescausing havoc on the beach. To avoid infection, it's imperative not to scratch what is an incredibly itchy bite. Bring along hydrocortisone cream and calamine lotion for the bite. Seek medical assistance if it gets infected. To prevent bites, repellant containing DEET is your best bet, and avoid the beach at dawn and dusk.
8 Information Even though they are 1000km east of the mainland, the Andamans still run on Indian time. This means that it can be dark by 5pm and light by 4am; people here tend to be very early risers.
All telephone numbers must include the 03192 area code, even when dialling locally.
PERMITS
All foreigners need a permit to visit the Andaman Islands; it’s issued free on arrival from Port Blair’s airport or Haddo Jetty. The 30-day permit allows foreigners to stay in Port Blair, South and Middle Andaman (excluding tribal areas), North Andaman (Diglipur), Long Island, North Passage, Little Andaman (excluding tribal areas), and Havelock and Neil Islands. It’s possible to get a 15-
day extension from the Immigration Office (

 ; %03192-
237793; h8.30am-1pm & 2-5pm Mon-Fri, to 1pm Sat) in Port Blair, or at police stations
elsewhere.
Keep your permit on you at all times – you won’t be able to travel without it. Police frequently ask to see it, especially when you’re disembarking on other islands, and hotels will need permit details. You’ll also need it to pass immigration when departing the Andamans.
The permit also allows day trips to Jolly Buoy, South Cinque, Red Skin, Ross, Narcondam, Interview and Rutland Islands, as well as the Brothers and the Sisters. For most day permits it’s not the hassle but the cost. For areas such as Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park, and Ross and Smith Islands near Diglipur, the permits cost ₹50/500 for Indians/foreigners. Students with valid ID pay minimal entry fees, so don’t forget to bring your card.
The Nicobar Islands are off-limits to all except Indian nationals engaged in research, government business or trade.8 Getting There & Away
AIR
There are daily flights to Port Blair from Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai, though flights from Delhi and Kolkata are often routed through Chennai. Round-trip fares are between US$250 and US$600, depending on how early you book; some airlines offer one-way flights for as low as US$80, but these need to be booked months in advance. There are no international flights from Port Blair to Southeast Asia.

BOAT
Depending on who you ask, the infamous boat to Port Blair is either the only real way to get to the Andamans or a hassle and a half. The truth lies somewhere in between. There are usually three to four sailings a month between Port Blair and Chennai (three days) and Kolkata (four to five days), plus a monthly ferry to Visakhapatnam (four days). All ferries from the mainland arrive at Haddo Jetty.
Take sailing times with a large grain of salt – travellers have reported sitting on the boat at Kolkata harbour for up to 12 hours, or waiting to dock near Port Blair for several hours. With hold-ups and variable weather and sea conditions, the trip can take a day or two extra.
Assistant Director of Shipping Services (%044-25226873; 17 Rajaji Salai,Jawahar Bldg, Chennai Port; h10am-1pm & 2-4pm Mon-Fri, to 12.30pm Sat) has boats from Chennai, Shipping Corporation of India (%033-22543505/7, in Kolkata 033- 22543400; www.shipindia.com; 13 Strand Rd, Kolkata; h9am-1pm & 2-5pm Mon-Fri, to noon Sat)

You can organise your return ticket at the ferry booking office at Phoenix Bay. Bring two passport photos and a photocopy of your permit. Updated schedules and fares can be found at www.andamans.gov.in or
www.shipindia.com. Otherwise enquire at Phoenix Bay’s info office.
Classes vary slightly between boats, but the cheapest is bunk (₹2270), followed by 2nd-class (six beds, ₹5817), 1st class (four beds, ₹7319) and deluxe cabins (two beds, ₹8841). Higher-end tickets cost as much as, if not more than, a plane ticket. If you go bunk, prepare for waking up to a chorus of men ‘hwwaaaaching’ and spitting, little privacy and toilets that tend to get… unpleasant after three days at sea. That said, it’s a good way to meet locals, and one for proponents of slow, adventure travel.
Food (tiffin for breakfast, thalis for lunch and dinner) costs around ₹150/200 per day for bunk/cabin class, though bring something (fruit in particular) to supplement your diet. Some bedding is supplied, but if you’re travelling bunk class bring a sleeping sheet. Many travellers take a hammock to string up on deck.
There is no ferry between Port Blair and Thailand, but private yachts can get clearance. You can’t legally get from the Andamans to Myanmar (Burma) by sea. Be aware you risk imprisonment or worse from the Indian and Burmese navies if you give this a go.
FERRY CANCELLATIONS
Bad weather can play havoc with your itinerary, with ferry services often cancelled if the sea is too rough. Build in a few days’ buffer to avoid being marooned and missing your flight.8 Getting Around
AIR
Two modes of air transport link Port Blair with the other islands. If your budget allows it, it's worth it for the views.
Interisland Helicopter
HELICOPTER
 
While the interisland helicopter service isn’t for tourists, you can chance your luck by applying one day before at the Directorate of Civil Aviation office (%03192-233601; VIP Rd Port Blair Helipad) at the helipad near the airport. It runs to/from Port Blair to Little Andaman (₹2625, 35 minutes), Havelock (₹1500, 20 minutes), Diglipur (₹4125, one hour) and Mayabunder (₹3375, 45 minutes). The 5kg baggage limit precludes most tourists from using this service.
Sea Plane
(%09531828222; andamanseaplane@gmail.com; hMon-Sat)
FLIGHT
The amphibious Sea Plane links Port Blair with Havelock (₹4100), Little Andaman (₹7170) and Diglipur (₹10,500), landing and taking off on the water, and the runway in Port Blair. It operates January to April, daily except Sunday. Note the 5kg baggage limit.
BOAT
Most islands can only be reached by water. While this sounds romantic, ferry ticket offices can be hell: expect hot waits, slow service, queue-jumping and a rugby scrum to the ticket window. To hold your spot and advance in line, you need to be a little aggressive (but not a jerk) or be a woman; ladies’ queues are a godsend for women travellers, but they really only apply in Port Blair. You can buy tickets the day you travel by arriving at the appropriate jetty an hour beforehand, but this is risky, and normally one or two days in advance is recommended. You can’t pre-book ferry tickets until you’ve been issued your island permit upon arrival in the Andamans.
There are regular boat services to Havelock and Neil Islands (three to four per day), as well as Rangat, Mayabunder, Diglipur and Little Andaman. A scheduleof interisland sailing times can be found at www.andamans.gov.in.
Two private ferry companies also run to Havelock and Neil Islands from Port Blair.

PERMIT COPIES
At the time of research it was a requirement to produce a photocopy of your permit when booking ferry tickets. While you’re not always asked to provide it, to avoid the trauma of having to re-queue, it’s worth taking five or so copies before arriving at Port Blair’s ferry office: you’ll likely need them later in your trip.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
A car with driver costs ₹550 per 35km, or around ₹10,000 for a return trip to Diglipur from Port Blair (including stopovers along the way). Motorbikes and scooters are available for hire from Port Blair and all the islands from around ₹300 to ₹400 per day. Due to restrictions in travel within tribal areas, it’s not permitted for foreigners to drive their own vehicles to North and Middle Andaman.
BUS
All roads – and ferries – lead to Port Blair, and you’ll inevitably spend a night or two here booking onward travel. The main island group – South, Middle and North Andaman – is connected by road, with ferry crossings and bridges. Buses run south from Port Blair to Wandoor, and north to Baratang, Rangat, Mayabunder and finally to Diglipur, 325km north of the capital.
Port Blair
Pop 100 608Pop 100,608
Though surrounded by attractive lush forest and rugged coastline, Port Blair (PB) is more or less your typical Indian town that serves as the provincial capital of the Andamans. It’s a vibrant mix of Indian Ocean inhabitants – Bengalis, Tamils, Telugus, Nicobarese and Burmese. Most travellers don’t hang around any longer than necessary (usually one or two days while waiting to book onward travel in the islands, or returning for departure), but PB’s fascinating history makes for some worthwhile sightseeing that warrants exploration.

A former British prison, the evocative Cellular Jail National Memorial now serves as a shrine to the political dissidents it once jailed. Construction of the jail began in 1896 and it was completed in 1906 – the original seven wings (several of which were destroyed by the Japanese during WWII) contained 698 cells radiating from a central tower. Like many political prisons, Cellular Jail became something of a university for freedom fighters, who exchanged books, ideas and debates despite walls and wardens. Guides (₹200) are available to show you around.
There’s a fairly cheesy sound-and-light show detailing the jail’s history in English at 7.15pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday – weather permitting.

Located on Chatham Island (reached by a road bridge), the saw mill was set up by the British in 1883 and was one of the largest wood processors in Asia. The mill is still operational, and while it may not be to everyone’s taste, especially conservationists, it’s an interesting insight to the island’s history and economy. Look out for the bomb crater, left by Japanese ordnance in WWII.
Corbyn’s Cove
BEACH

No one comes to Port Blair for the beach, but if you need a break from town, Corbyn’s Cove has a small curve of sand backed by palms. The coastal road here is a scenic journey, and passes several Japanese WWII bunkers along the way. Located 7km south of town, an autorickshaw costs ₹200, or you can rent a scooter. Crocodiles are occasionally spotted in the area.
ISLAND INDIGENES
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands’ indigenous peoples constitute 12% of the population and, in most cases, their numbers are decreasing. The Onge, Sentinelese, Andamanese and Jarawa are all of Negrito ethnicity, and share a strong resemblance to people from Africa. Tragically, numerous groups have become extinct over the past century. In February 2010 the last speaker of the Bo language passed away, bringing an end to a culture and language that originated 65,000 years ago.
The Land of the Naked People (2003) by Madhusree Mukerjee provides an interesting anthropological account.
It’s important to note that these ethnic groups live in areas strictly off limits to foreigners, and people have been arrested for trying to visit these areas.
JARAWA
The 250 remaining Jarawa occupy the 639-sq-km reserve on South and Middle Andaman Islands. In 1953 the chief commissioner requested that an armed sea plane bomb Jarawasettlements, and their territory has been consistently disrupted by the Andaman Trunk Rd, forest clearance and settler and tourist encroachment. In 2012, a video went viral showing an exchange between Jarawa and tourists, whereby a policeman orders them to dance in exchange for food. This resulted in a government inquest that saw to the end of the so-called ‘human safari’ tours.
NICOBARESE
The 30,000 Nicobarese are the only indigenous people whose numbers are not decreasing. The majority have converted to Christianity and been partly assimilated into contemporary Indian society. Living in village units led by a head man, they farm pigs and cultivate coconuts, yams and bananas. The Nicobarese, who probably descended from people of Malaysia and Myanmar, inhabit a number of islands in the Nicobar group, centred on Car Nicobar, the region worst affected by the 2004 tsunami.
ONGE
Two-thirds of Little Andaman’s Onge Island was taken over by the Forest Department and ‘settled’ in 1977. The 100 or so remaining members of the Onge tribe live in a 25-sq- km reserve covering Dugong Creek and South Bay. Anthropologists say the Onge population has declined due to demoralisation through loss of territory.
SENTINELESE
The Sentinelese, unlike the other tribes on these islands, have consistently repelled outside contact. For years, contact parties arrived on the beaches of North Sentinel Island, the last redoubt of the Sentinelese, with gifts of coconuts, bananas, pigs and red plastic buckets, only to be showered with arrows, though some encounters have been a little less hostile. About 150 Sentinelese remain.
ANDAMANESE
As they now number only about 50, it seems impossible the Andamanese can escape extinction. There were around 7000 Andamanese in the mid-19th century, but friendliness to colonisers was their undoing, and by 1971 all but 19 of the population had been swept away by measles, syphilis and influenza epidemics. They have been resettled on tiny Strait Island.
SHOMPEN
Only about 250 Shompen remain in the forests on Great Nicobar. Seminomadic hunter- gatherers who live along the riverbanks, they have resisted integration and avoid areas occupied by Indian immigrants.

DON'T MISS
ROSS ISLAND
Just a 20-minute boat ride from Port Blair, visiting Ross Island (not to be confused with its namesake island in North Andaman) feels like discovering a jungle-clad Lost City, à la Angkor Wat, except here the ruins are Victorian English rather than ancient Khmer. The former administrative headquarters for the British in the Andamans, Ross Island in its day was fondly called the ‘Paris of the East’ (along with Pondicherry, Saigon etc etc…), but the cute title, vibrant social scene and tropical gardens were all wiped out by the double whammy of a 1941 earthquake and invasion by the Japanese.
Today the old English architecture is still standing, despite an invading wave of fast- growing jungle vegetation. Landscaped paths cross the island and most of the buildings are labelled. There’s a small museum with historical displays and resident spotted deer. A sound-and-light show was also on the cards at the time of research.
Ferries to Ross Island (₹100, 20 minutes) depart hourly from Aberdeen Jetty behind the aquarium in Port Blair, between 8.30am and 2pm every day except Wednesday.
8 Information There are several ATMs around town. You can find internet cafes, with wi-fi and computer terminals (₹40 per hour), in Aberdeen Bazaar near the clock tower.

BeachesRadhanagar
(Beach 7)
BEACH
One of India’s prettiest and most famous stretches of sand is the critically acclaimed Radhanagar. It’s a beautiful curve of sugar fronted by perfectly spiraled waves, all backed by native forest. It’s on the northwestern side of the island, about 12km from the jetty.
Late afternoon is the best time to visit to avoid the heat and crowds, as well as for its sunset. The further you walk from the main entry the more privacy you’ll get.
Neils Cove
BEACH
 
Northwest of Radhanagar is the gorgeous ‘lagoon’ at Neils Cove, another gem of sheltered sand and crystalline water. Swimming is prohibited at dusk and dawn; take heed of any warnings regarding crocodiles.
Beach 5
BEACH
 
On the north-eastern coast of the island, the palm-ringed Beach 5 has your more classic tropical vibe, with the bonus of shady patches and fewer sandflies. However, swimming is very difficult in low tide when the water becomes shallow for miles. Most of the island’s accommodation is out this way.
Kalapathar
BEACH
 
Hidden away 5km south of Beach 5, you’ll find the low-key Kalapathar, a pristine beach. You’ll have to walk a bit to get away from package tourists.
Diving & Snorkelling
Havelock is the premier spot for diving in the Andamans. It’s world renowned for its crystal-clear waters, deep-sea corals, schools of fish, turtles and kaleidoscope of colourful marine life. Diving here is suitable for all levels.
The main dive season is roughly November to April, but trips run year-round.All companies offer fully equipped boat dives, and prices vary depending on the location, number of participants and duration of the course. Diving starts from around ₹5000 for a two-tank dive, with options of Discover Scuba (one hour ₹4500), PADI open-water (four dives ₹21,700) and advanced (three dives ₹13,500) courses.
While coral bleaching has been a major issue since 2010 (mainly due to El Niño weather patterns), diving remains world-class. The shallows may not have bright corals, but all the colourful fish are still here, and for depths beyond 16m, corals remain as vivid as ever. The Andamans recovered from a similar bleaching in 1998, and today things are likewise slowly repairing themselves.
Popular sites are Dixon’s Pinnacle and Pilot Reef with colourful soft coral, South Button for macro dives (to see small critters) and rock formations, Jackson Bar or Johhny’s Gorge for deeper dives with schools of snapper, sharks, rays and turtles, and Minerva’s Delight for a bit of everything. There’s also a wreck dive to SS Incheket, a 1950s cargo carrier. Keep an eye out for trips further afield such as Barren Island, home to India’s only active volcano, whose ash produces an eerie underwater spectacle for divers.
Dive companies can arrange snorkelling trips, but it’s cheaper to organise a boat through your guesthouse. Snorkelling gear is widely available on Havelock but is generally low quality.
Most boats head to Elephant Beach for snorkelling, which can also be reached by a 40-minute walk through a muddy elephant logging trail; it’s well marked (off the cross-island road), but turns to bog if it’s been raining. At high tide it’s also impossible to reach – ask locally for more info. Lots of snorkelling charters, and even jet skis, come out this way, so be prepared as it can be a bit of a circus. If you head here around 6am, you’ll get the place to yourself.
Prices are standardised, so it’s a matter of finding a dive operator you feel comfortable with.

Some resorts can organise guided jungle treks for keen walkers or birdwatchers, but be warned the forest floor turns to glug after rain. The inside rainforest is a spectacular, emerald-coloured hinterland cavern, and the birdwatching – especially on the forest fringes – is rewarding; look out for the blue-black racket-tailed drongo or golden oriole.

Neil Island
Happy to laze in the shadows of its more famous island neighbour, tranquil Neil is still the place for that added bit of relaxation. Its beaches may not be as luxurious as Havelock’s, but they have ample character and are a perfect distance apart to explore by bicycle. There’s a lovely unhurried pace of life here; cycling through picturesque villages you’ll get many friendly hellos. The main bazaar has a mellow vibe and is a popular gathering spot in the early evening. Inba aa    as a    e  ow v be a d  s a popu a  gat e    g spot     t e ea  y eve     g.

1 Sights & Activitieses Neil Island’s five beaches (numbered one to five) all have their unique charms, though they aren’t necessarily great for swimming.
Beach 1
(Laxmanpur)
BEACH
Beach 1 is a long sweep of sandy beach and mangrove, a 40-minute walk west of the jetty and village. There’s a good sunset viewpoint out this way accessed via Pearl Park Beach Resort. Dugongs are sometime spotted here.
Beach 2
BEACH
 
On the north side of the island, Beach 2 has the Natural Bridge rock formation, accessible only at low tide by walking around the rocky cove. To get here by bicycle, take the side road that runs through the bazaar, then take a left where the road forks.

Beach 4
(Bharatpur)
BEACH
The best swimming beach, though its proximity to the jetty is a turn-off, as are rowdy day-trippers who descend upon the beach in motorised boats.
Beach 5
(Sitapur)
BEACHThe more rugged Beach 5, 5km from the village on the eastern side of Neil, is a nice place to walk along the sand, with small limestone caves accessible at low tide.
Diving & Snorkelling
Neil Island offers some excellent dive sites, with colourful fish, large schools of Jack, turtles, sharks, rays, and soft and hard corals.
The island’s best snorkelling is around the coral reef at the far (western) end of Beach 1 at high tide; if you’re extremely lucky you may spot a dugong feeding in the shallows at high tide. Beach 3 also has good snorkelling. Gear costs around ₹150 to hire and available from many guesthouses.
There are two dive operators on Neil Island. Open water course, among others, are also available. Those interested in free diving can contact Sanjay at Gayan Garden.

8 Information There’s no ATM or moneychanging facilities on Neil, so bring plenty of cash. There’s wi-fi access at Pearl Park Beach Resort on Beach 1 for ₹200 per 24 hours.
8 Getting There & Around A ferry heads to Port Blair two or three times a day (₹378, two hours). There are also one or two daily ferries to Havelock (₹378, one hour), and three ferries a week to Long Island (₹378, five hours). Makruzz and Coastal Cruise also have ferries to/from Port Blair (from ₹875, one hour) and Havelock (from ₹710) Hiring a bicycle (per day from ₹80) is the best way to get about; roads are flat and distances short. You’ll be able to find one in the bazaar or at a guesthouse. An autorickshaw will take you from the jetty to Beach 1 or 3 for ₹70 to ₹100.
Middle & North Andaman
The Andamans aren’t just sun and sand. They are also jungle that feels as primeval as the Jurassic, a green tangle of ancient forest that could have been birthed in Mother Nature’s subconscious. This wild, antediluvian side of the islands can be seen on a long, loping bus ride up the Andaman Trunk Rd (ATR), crossing tannin-red rivers, prowled by saltwater crocodiles, on roll-on, roll-off ferries.
But there’s a negative side to riding the ATR: the road cuts through the homeland of the Jarawa and has brought the tribe into incessant contact with the outside world. Modern India and tribal life do not seem able to coexist – every time Jarawa and settlers interact, misunderstandings have led to friction, confusion and, at worst, violent attacks and death. Indian anthropologists and indigenous rights groups such as Survival International have called for the ATR to be closed; its status continues to be under review. At present, vehicles arepermitted to travel only in convoys at set times from 6am to 3pm. Photography is strictly prohibited, as is stopping or any other interaction with the Jarawa people who are becoming increasingly reliant on handouts from passing traffic.
The first place of interest north of Port Blair are the limestone caves (hTue-Sun) at Baratang. It’s a 45-minute boat trip (₹450) from the jetty, a scenic trip through mangrove forest. A permit is required, organised at the jetty.
Rangat & Around
Rangat is the next main town, a transport hub with not much else going for it. If you do get stuck here, UK Nest has clean budget rooms, while Priya International is a more upmarket choice with handy tourist information on things to do in the area. There’s an ATM nearby. The turtle breeding grounds at Dhaninallah Mangrove is the most popular sight, viewed early evening (mid- December to April) from the newly constructed 1km-long boardwalk, a 45- minute drive from Rangat.
Ferries depart Long Island (₹11) from Yeratta Jetty, 8km from Rangat (accessed by local bus), at 9am and 3.30pm. Rangat Bay, 5km outside town, has ferries to/from Port Blair (₹378, six hours) and Havelock (₹378, two hours). A daily bus goes to Port Blair (₹145, seven hours) and Diglipur (₹65, four hours).
Long Island
With its friendly island community and lovely slow pace of life, Long Island is perfect for those wanting to take the pace down a few more notches. Other than the odd motorcycle, there’s no motorised vehicles on the island, and at certain times you may be the only tourist here.
1 Sights & Activities
Beaches
There’s a nice beach close to Blue Planet, reached via the yellow arrows.Lalaji Bay
BEACH
 
A 1½-hour trek (or cross-trail jog if you’re feeling energetic) in the jungle will lead you to the secluded Lalaji Bay, a beautiful white-sand beach with good swimming and snorkelling; follow the red arrows to get here. Hiring a dunghi (motorised wooden boat; ₹2500 return for two people) is also an option. Inconveniently, you need a permit (free) from the Forest Office near the jetty to visit.
Diving & Snorkelling
Blue Planet has a dive shop (December to March), charging ₹4000 for two dives, and visits Campbell Shoal for its schools of trevally and barracuda.
You can also get a dunghi to North Passage Island for snorkelling at the stunning Merk Bay (₹3500 for two people) with blinding white sand and translucent waters.
There’s excellent offshore snorkelling at Lalaji Bay with colourful corals out front from the rest huts. There’s also good snorkelling at the ‘Blue Planet’ beach, directly out from the blue Hindu temple; swim beyond the sea grass to get to the coral. Blue Planet hires snorkelling gear for ₹100.
4 Sleeping
o Blue Planet
GUESTHOUSE
(%9474212180; www.blueplanetandamans.com; r with/without bathroom from ₹1500/500; i)
The only place to stay on the island, so fortunately it’s a gem, with thatched- bamboo rooms and hammocks set around a lovely Padauk tree. Food is delicious and there’s free filtered water. It’s a 15-minute walk from the jetty; follow the blue arrow markers. It also has wonderful double-storey bamboo cottages (from ₹3000) at a nearby location.
8 Getting There & Away There are four ferries a week to Havelock, Neil and Port Blair (₹195). From Yeratta, there are two daily boats to Long Island (₹11, one hour) at 9am and 3.30pm, returning at 7amand 2pm. A bus meets ferries at Yeratta. If you can't get a ferry here from Port Blair, jump on a bus to Rangat to get the ferry from Yeratta.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
MAYABUNDER & AROUND
In ‘upper’ Middle Andaman, Mayabunder is most famous for its villages inhabited by Karen, members of a Burmese hill tribe who were relocated here during the British colonial period. It’s a low-key destination and will appeal to travellers looking for an experience away from the crowds.
You can go on a range of day tours, with the highlight being jungle trekking at creepy Interview Island (boat hire ₹3000, up to six people), inhabited by a population of 36 wild elephants, descendants of working elephants released after a logging company closed for business in the 1950s. You’ll feel very off the beaten track here. Armed guards accompany you in case of elephant encounters. A permit (₹500) is required, which is best organised by emailing a copy of your arrival permit to Sea’n’Sand guesthouse. Other trips include turtle nesting at Dhaninallah Mangrove (December to March); Forty One Caves, where hawabills (swiftlets) make their highly prized edible nests; and snorkelling off Avis Island (boat hire ₹1500).
Sea’n’Sand (%03192-273454; titusinseansand@yahoo.com; r from ₹750; a) is easily the best place to stay with comfortable rooms. Hosts Titus and Elizabeth (and their extended Karen family) are an excellent source for everything Mayabunder. Go the top level for water views. The food here is sensational.
Mayabunder, 71km north of Rangat (₹70, two hours), is linked by daily buses from Port Blair (₹200, 10 hours) and Diglipur (₹55, two hours) and by thrice-weekly ferries. There’s an ATM here.
Diglipur & Around
Those who make it this far north are rewarded with some impressive attractions in the area. It’s a giant outdoor adventure playground designed for nature lovers: home to a world-famous turtle nesting site, Andaman’s highest peak and a network of caves to go with white-sand beaches and some of the best snorkelling in the Andamans.
However, don’t expect much of Diglipur (population 70,000), the second largest town in the Andamans, a sprawling, gritty bazaar town with an ATM andinternet access (per hour ₹40). Instead head straight for the tranquil coastal village of Kalipur.
Ferries and some buses arrive at Aerial Bay, from where it’s 11km to Diglipur, and 8km to Kalipur in the other direction.
2 Activities Diglipur has huge tourist potential, and those who hang around will have plenty to discover. In season most come to see the turtles. Get in touch with Pristine Beach Resort, who are involved with the DARTED grassroots tourist initiative to promote Alfred Caves, mud volcanoes and crocodile habitats. It’s also possible to visit elephant work camps.
Ross & Smith Islands
(hclosed Tue)
BEACH, SNORKELLING
Like lovely tropical counterweights, the twin islands of Smith and Ross are connected by a narrow sandbar of dazzling white sand, and are up there with the best in the Andamans for both swimming and snorkelling.
No permits are required for Smith Island, which is accessed by boat (₹2500, fits five people) from Aerial Bay. While theoretically you need a permit for Ross Island (₹500), as it’s walkable from Smith permits generally aren’t checked. Enquire with Pristine Resort for more info.
Ross and Smith are closed Tuesday for beach cleaning; volunteers are welcome (cost ₹250, covering permit, transport, snorkelling and food).
Saddle Peak
(Indian/foreigner ₹25/250)
TREKKING
At 732m Saddle Peak is the highest point in the Andamans. You can trek through subtropical forest to the top and back from Kalipur in about six to seven hours; the views from the peaks onto the archipelago are incredible. It’s a demanding trek, so bring plenty of water (around 4L). A permit (₹250) is required from the Forest Office at the trailhead, open 6am to 2pm. A local guide(300₹) will make sure you don’t get lost, but otherwise follow the red arrows marked on the trees.
Craggy Island
SNORKELLING
 
A small island off Kalipur, Craggy is a good spot for snorkelling. Strong swimmers can make it across (flippers recommended), otherwise a dunghi is available (₹2500 return).
Excelsior Island
SNORKELLING
 
Recently opened for tourism, Excelsior has more beautiful beaches, snorkelling plus resident spotted deer. Permits are required (₹500); boats cost ₹4500 and fit seven people.
DON'T MISS
TURTLE NESTING IN KALIPUR
Reputedly the only beach in the world where leatherback, hawksbill, olive ridley marine and green turtles all nest along the same coastline, Kalipur is a fantastic place to observe this evening show from mid-December and April. Turtles can be witnessed most nights, and you can assist with collecting eggs, or with the release of hatchlings. Contact Pristine Beach Resort for more information.
The Dhaninallah Mangrove boardwalk north of Rangat is another good spot to see turtles.

Little Andaman
As far south as you can go in the islands, Little Andaman has an appealing end- of-the-world feel. It’s a gorgeous fist of mangroves, jungle and teal, ringed by beaches as fresh as bread out of the oven. It rates highly as many traveller’s favourite spot in the Andamans.
Badly hit by the 2004 tsunami, Little Andaman has slowly rebuilt itself. Located about 120km south of Port Blair, the main settlement here is Hut Bay, a pleasant small town that primarily produces smiling Bengalis and Tamils.
1 Sights & Activities
Little Andaman Lighthouse
LIGHTHOUSE
 
Located 14km east of Hut Bay, Little Andaman lighthouse makes for a worthwhile excursion. Standing 41m high, exactly 200 steps spiral up to magnificent views over the coastline and forest. The easiest way to get here is byg
yg                 y
motorcycle. Otherwise take a sweaty bicycle journey or autorickshaw until the road becomes unpassable; from there, walk for an hour along the blissful stretch of deserted beach.
Beaches
Come prepared for sandflies; crocodiles are also about.
Butler Bay
(entry ₹20)
Little Andaman’s best beach is Butler Bay, a spectacular curved beach with lifeguards and good surf. It's located at 14km mark.
Netaji Nagar
 
BEACH
BEACH
The sprawling and rugged Netaji Nagar, stretching 8km to 12km north of Hut Bay, is the beach where most accommodation is located. The downside is the occasional rubbish that washes ashore from Thailand and Myanmar.
Kalapathar
BEACH
 
Located before Butler Bay is Kalapathar lagoon, a popular enclosed swimming area with shady patches of sand. Look for the cave in the cliff face that you can scramble through for stunning ocean views. It’s accessed via a side road that runs past modern housing constructed after the 2004 tsunami.
Surfing
Intrepid surfing travellers have been whispering about Little Andaman since it first opened to foreigners several years ago. The reef breaks are legendary, but best suited for more experienced surfers. The most accessible is Jarawa Point, a left reef break at northern point of Butler Bay. Beginners should stick to beach breaks along Km8 to Km11. February to April generally bring the best waves.

Waterfalls
Inland, the White Surf and Whisper Wave waterfalls offer a jungle experience for when you’re done lazing on the beach. The latter involves a 4km forest trek and a guide is highly recommended. They are pleasant falls and you may be tempted to swim in the rock pools, but beware of crocodiles.
